By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Since 15 is a prime number, the only divisors of 15 are 1 and 15. Therefore, the only possible orders for elements in G are 1 and 15. Since a has order 15, it follows that a generates a cyclic subgroup of G of order 15. This subgroup has 15 elements, and since a is in this subgroup, it must have order 15. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nProof: Let's consider a group G with more than 8 elements of order 15. By the previous proof, we know that a group with an element of order 15 must have at least 15 elements of order 15. Therefore, if G has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. Therefore, the statement is also true.\n\nSo, both statements are true, and the correct answer is A. True, True.",
