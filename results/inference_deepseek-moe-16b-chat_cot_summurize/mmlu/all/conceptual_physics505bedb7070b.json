The more force applied and the greater the distance, the greater the potential energy of the spring.\n\nSimilarly, the potential energy of a charged object is directly proportional to the amount of charge on the object and the distance between the object and a reference point. The more charge on the object and the greater the distance, the greater the potential energy of the object.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both of these.",
