The blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after Lord Rayleigh, who first described this phenomenon.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Earth's atmosphere does not have a blue color. The color of the atmosphere is determined by the sunlight it reflects, not its own color.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the sky does not reflect the color of the Earth's oceans. The color of the sky is determined by the sunlight it reflects, not the color of the Earth's surface.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Earth's atmosphere does not preferentially absorb all other colors. The sky appears blue because the atmosphere scatters blue light more than other colors.",
