The azimuth of the NCP is the angular distance from the North Pole.\n\nThe north celestial pole (NCP) is the point in the sky where the Earth's axis of rotation intersects the celestial sphere. It is located at the North Pole, which is the Earth's geographic North Pole. By locating the NCP in the sky, you can determine your latitude by knowing the direction it is located from the North Pole.\n\nThe azimuth of the NCP is the angular distance from the North Pole, measured clockwise from the north direction. To find your latitude, you can use a compass or a map to determine the direction of the NCP and then use a conversion table or a calculator to find your latitude.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the azimuth of the NCP is not the same as your latitude. Option C is incorrect because the altitude of the NCP is not the same as your latitude. Option D is incorrect because the altitude of the NCP is not your angular distance from the North Pole.",
