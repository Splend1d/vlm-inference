The harmonics that will survive are the ones that have an odd number of half wavelengths in the closed pipe.\n\nThe first harmonic (n=1) has one half wavelength in the closed pipe, the second harmonic (n=2) has three half wavelengths, the third harmonic (n=3) has five half wavelengths, the fourth harmonic (n=4) has seven half wavelengths, and the fifth harmonic (n=5) has nine half wavelengths.\n\nThe harmonics that have an odd number of half wavelengths are the third harmonic (n=3) and the fifth harmonic (n=5). Therefore, the first and second harmonics (n=1 and n=2) will not survive in the closed pipe, and the fourth harmonic (n=4) will not survive in the closed pipe.",
