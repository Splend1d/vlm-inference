            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the Henry's law constant and the given information about the pressure of CO2 in the vessel and the concentration of CO2 in the water.\n\nHenry's law constant (H) is defined as the amount of a gas that will dissolve in a given amount of liquid at a given temperature, divided by the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.\n\nH = k * P_gas\n\nwhere k is the Henry's law constant, P_gas is the partial pressure of the gas, and k is the concentration of the gas in the liquid.\n\nWe are given the Henry's law constant (k) as 30.0 atm M^\u22121, the pressure of CO2 in the vessel (P_CO2) as 2.0 atm, and the concentration of CO2 in the water (C_CO2) as 0.067 M.\n\nWe can use the given information to solve for the concentration of CO2 in the water (C_CO2).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given pressure of CO2 in the vessel to atmospheres:\n\nP_CO2 = 2.0 atm\n\nNext, we can use the Henry's law constant (k) and the given pressure of CO2 in the vessel to solve for the concentration of CO2 in the water (C_CO2):\n\nC_CO2 = k * P_CO2\n\nC_CO2 = 30.0 atm M^\u22121 * 2.0 atm\n\nC_CO2 = 60.0 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the water in the vessel is 60.0 M.\n\nThe answer is: 60",
