            "content": " The correct answer is D. Increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues.\n\nThe question is asking about the effects of a mutation that causes an individual to retain a form of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood. Fetal hemoglobin is different from adult hemoglobin in that it has a higher affinity for oxygen, meaning it can bind more oxygen per molecule. This is important for the delivery of oxygen to the tissues, especially in the fetus, which has a higher oxygen demand than an adult.\n\nOption A, \"no differences from a normal adult,\" is incorrect because the individual would have a mutation that causes them to retain fetal hemoglobin, which is different from normal adult hemoglobin.\n\nOption B, \"significantly reduced oxygen binding in the lungs,\" is incorrect because the retention of fetal hemoglobin would actually increase oxygen binding in the tissues, not reduce it in the lungs.\n\nOption C, \"no symptoms, since retention of fetal hemoglobin would be fatal,\" is incorrect because the individual would not have a fatal mutation, but rather a mutation that causes them to retain fetal hemoglobin.\n\nOption D, \"increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues,\" is correct because the retention of fetal hemoglobin would increase the oxygen binding capacity of the hemoglobin in the tissues, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery.",
