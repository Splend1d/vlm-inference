However, we can notice a pattern. Each term in the sequence is the square root of a number that is increasing.\n\nLet's try to find a formula for the nth term of the sequence. Let's denote the nth term as x_n. We have:\n\nx_n = sqrt(3 + 2x_(n-1))\n\nNow, let's try to find a pattern in the terms of the sequence. We can see that the nth term is the square root of a number that is increasing. This means that the sequence is increasing.\n\nNow, let's try to find a formula for the limit of the sequence. We want to find the limit as n approaches infinity. Since the sequence is increasing, the limit must be a positive number.\n\nLet's denote the limit as L. We have:\n\nL = sqrt(3 + 2L)\n\nTo solve this equation, we can square both sides:\n\nL^2 = 3 + 2L\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation:\n\nL^2 - 2L - 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nL = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-3))) / 2(1)\nL = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 12)) / 2\nL = (2 \u00b1 \u221a16) / 2\nL = (2 \u00b1 4) / 2\n\nThis gives us two possible values for L:\n\nL = (2 + 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\nL = (2 - 4) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1\n\nHowever, since the sequence is increasing, the limit must be a positive number. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nL = 3",
