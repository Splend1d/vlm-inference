This means that interest-based transactions, such as loans and mortgages, are not allowed. Additionally, Islamic finance prohibits certain and speculative transactions, as well as investments in sinful activities, such as alcohol, gambling, and pornography. All financial products are required to be backed by tangible assets, such as real estate or commodities, to ensure that they are based on actual economic activity and not on speculation.",
