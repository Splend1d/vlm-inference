            "content": " To solve this problem, we can use the concept of graph theory. We can represent the students as vertices and the friendships as edges in a graph. We can then use the Handshaking Lemma to determine the number of teams needed.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees of all students is equal to twice the number of friendships.\n\nSince each student dislikes three classmates, the sum of the degrees of all students is 3n, where n is the total number of students.\n\nWe want to find the smallest number of teams such that the sum of the degrees of all students in each team is 0. This means that each team must have an equal number of students, and each student must have the same number of friends in each team.\n\nLet's denote the number of teams as t. Then, the sum of the degrees of all students in each team is t. Since the sum of the degrees of all students is 3n, we have:\n\n3n = t\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest value of n that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trial and error:\n\nn = 1: 3n = 3, not divisible by 3\nn = 2: 3n = 6, not divisible by 3\nn = 3: 3n = 9, not divisible by 3\nn = 4: 3n = 12, divisible by 3\n\nSo, the smallest value of n that satisfies the equation is n = 4. Therefore, the number of teams needed is t = 3n = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
