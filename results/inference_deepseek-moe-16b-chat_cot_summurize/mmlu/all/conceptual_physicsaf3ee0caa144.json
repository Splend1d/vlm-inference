            "content": " When food is exposed to gamma radiation, the food does not become radioactive. The gamma radiation is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, similar to X-rays, but with much higher energy. This radiation is used in the process of irradiation, which is a method of food preservation. The gamma rays interact with the food, causing the molecules to vibrate and break down any harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and insects.\n\nHowever, the gamma radiation does not change the chemical composition of the food itself. It does not introduce any new radioactive elements into the food, nor does it alter the natural radioactive isotopes that may be present in the food. Therefore, the food does not become radioactive after being exposed to gamma radiation.\n\nThe process of irradiation is widely used in the food industry to extend the shelf life of various products, such as fruits, vegetables, spices, and even meat and poultry. It is a safe and effective method of food preservation, as it does not introduce any new chemicals or toxins into the food.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. When food is exposed to gamma radiation, it does not become radioactive.",
