The mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, and hard palate.\n\nA dental panoramic radiograph, also known as a panorex, is a type of x-ray that captures a wide-angle view of the patient's jaw, teeth, and surrounding structures. It is commonly used for diagnosing dental problems, planning orthodontic treatment, and evaluating the need for extractions or other surgical procedures.\n\nOn a dental panoramic radiograph, the following structures should be visible:\n\n1. The mandibular canal: This is the passageway for the mandibular nerve and blood vessels that run through the mandible (lower jawbone). It is located on the posterior (back) aspect of the lower jaw.\n\n2. The maxillary sinus: This is a hollow space in the maxilla (upper jawbone) that contains air. It is located above the upper teeth and behind the eyes.\n\n3. The hard palate: This is the bony and muscular roof of the mouth, located at the top of the mouth.\n\nThe zygomatic arch, which is part of the temporal bone and is located in front of the ear, is not visible on a dental panoramic radiograph.",
