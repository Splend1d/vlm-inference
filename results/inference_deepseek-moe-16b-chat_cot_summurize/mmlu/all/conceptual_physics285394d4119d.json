The arrangement of atoms in minerals is more complex and can be described by crystal structures, which are the 3-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice. The arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice is determined by the type of atoms, the forces between them, and the symmetry of the crystal lattice. The arrangement of atoms in a mineral can be described by its crystal structure, which is a set of coordinates that describe the position of each atom in the crystal lattice.",
