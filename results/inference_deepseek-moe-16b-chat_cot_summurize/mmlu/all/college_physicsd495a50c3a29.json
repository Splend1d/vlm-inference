            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the cyclotron frequency, which is given by:\n\nf = (qB) / (2 * m * v)\n\nwhere f is the cyclotron frequency, q is the charge of the particle, B is the magnetic field strength, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nWe are given the cyclotron frequency (f = 1,600 Hz) and the magnetic field strength (B = \u03c0/4 T). We need to find the mass of the particle (m).\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the formula to solve for the mass:\n\nm = (2 * f * v) / (q * B)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nm = (2 * 1,600 Hz * v) / (2 * 1.6 * 10^-19 C * \u03c0/4 T)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the velocity (v) to meters per second. Since the units are not given, we can assume that the velocity is given in some unit of length per unit of time. Let's assume the velocity is 1 meter per second.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nm = (2 * 1,600 Hz * 1 m/s) / (2 * 1.6 * 10^-19 C * \u03c0/4 T)\n\nm = (3,200 Hz) / (1.6 * 10^-19 C * \u03c0/4 T)\n\nm = (3,200 Hz) / (4 * 10^-19 C)\n\nm = 8,000 Hz/C\n\nNow, we can convert the mass to kilograms:\n\nm = 8,000 Hz/C * (1 kg / 1,000,000 Hz)\n\nm = 8 * 10^-6 kg/Hz\n\nNow, we can convert the mass to the desired unit (10^-23 kg):\n\nm = 8 * 10^-6 kg/Hz * (10^-23 kg / 1 kg/Hz)\n\nm = 8 * 10^-23 kg\n\nTherefore, the mass of the particle is 8 * 10^-23 kg, which corresponds to option D.",
