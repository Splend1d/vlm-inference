The frontal bone is located at the front of the skull and forms the upper and lateral parts of the eye orbits. The zygomatic bone is located in the cheek area and forms part of the zygomatic arch. The zygomatic arch is a part of the facial skeleton and helps to protect the eye and some of the facial nerves.\n\nThe maxillary bone, temporal bone, and sphenoid bone are all bones in the skull, but they do not have a process that joins with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch. The maxillary bone is located in the upper jaw and forms part of the eye orbits, but it does not have a process that joins with the zygomatic bone. The temporal bone is located in the side of the skull and forms part of the middle ear, but it does not have a process that joins with the zygomatic bone. The sphenoid bone is located in the middle of the skull and forms part of the base of the skull, but it does not have a process that joins with the zygomatic bone.",
