This process can be implemented using any of the following data structures:\n\n1. A singly linked list: In a singly linked list, each node contains a value and a reference (or \"link\") to the next node in the list. To sort a linked list using mergesort, we can use a recursive approach to split the list in half and then merge the two halves back together. This process can be implemented in O(n log n) time.\n\n2. A doubly linked list: In a doubly linked list, each node contains a value and references to the previous and next nodes in the list. To sort a doubly linked list using mergesort, we can use a recursive approach to split the list in half and then merge the two halves back together. This process can be implemented in O(n log n) time.\n\n3. An array: In an array, each element is stored at a specific index. To sort an array using mergesort, we can use a recursive approach to split the array in half and then merge the two halves back together. This process can be implemented in O(n log n) time.\n\nTherefore, all three of these data structures (singly linked list, doubly linked list, and array) can support mergesort operations in O(n log n) time.",
