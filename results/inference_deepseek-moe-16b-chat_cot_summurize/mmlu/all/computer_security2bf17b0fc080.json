The size of the address depends on the architecture the program will run on.\n\nWhen a program is compiled, the compiler does not know the absolute address of a local variable because the size of the address depends on the architecture of the machine where the program will be executed. The compiler generates code that is specific to the architecture of the machine where the program will be executed, and the absolute address of a local variable may vary depending on the architecture.\n\nFor example, if a program is compiled for a machine with a 32-bit address space, the compiler will generate code that uses 32-bit addresses. If the program is later executed on a machine with a 64-bit address space, the absolute address of the local variable may change.\n\nTherefore, the compiler does not know the absolute address of a local variable because the size of the address depends on the architecture of the machine where the program will be executed.",
