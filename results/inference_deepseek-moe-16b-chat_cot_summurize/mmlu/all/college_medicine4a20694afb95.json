This process occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and does not require oxygen. The overall reaction of glycolysis can be represented as:\n\nC\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 (glucose) \u2192 2 C\u2083H\u2086O\u2083P (pyruvate or lactate) + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H\u207a + 2 H\u2082O\n\nIn this reaction, glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate or lactate, which can then be further metabolized in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) to produce more ATP or other cellular components. The overall process of glycolysis results in the production of two molecules of ATP, two molecules of NADH, and two molecules of H\u207a.",
