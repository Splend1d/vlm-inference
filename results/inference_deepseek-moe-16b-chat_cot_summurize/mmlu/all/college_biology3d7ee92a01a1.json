In this type of cleavage, the blastula is divided into a number of smaller cells that are arranged in a flat, plate-like structure, rather than in a radial or spiral pattern. This type of cleavage results in a lack of a clear polar axis, as the cells are not arranged around a central point. Instead, the cells are arranged in a flat, planar sheet, which is why it is also known as \"meroblastic\" cleavage.",
