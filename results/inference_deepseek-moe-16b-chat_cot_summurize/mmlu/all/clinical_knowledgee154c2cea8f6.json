The GCS consists of three components: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response.\n\nA. Eye opening: This category assesses whether the patient is able to open their eyes voluntarily.\nB. Verbal response: This category assesses whether the patient is able to speak and respond to commands.\nC. Best motor response: This category assesses the strength and coordination of the patient's motor responses.\nD. Pupil response: This category assesses the size, shape, and reactivity of the patient's pupils.\n\nTherefore, the category that is not used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale is \"Best motor response.\"",
