            "content": " B. Business Ethics is the study of business situations, activities and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed.\n\nThe statement A is incorrect because business ethics is a real concept that deals with the ethical principles and moral values that guide the actions and decisions of businesses and their employees. It is not about applying everyday life rules and ethics to business, but rather about addressing the specific ethical issues that arise in a business context.\n\nStatement C is incorrect because business ethics is not an oxymoronic term. An oxymoron is a combination of words that contradicts itself, such as \"jumbo shrimp\" or \"deafening silence.\" Business ethics is a well-established field of study that deals with the ethical aspects of business.\n\nStatement D is incorrect because business ethics is not solely concerned with assessing the profitability of a business based on its ethical activities. While profitability is an important consideration for any business, business ethics also involves considering the impact of business decisions on stakeholders such as employees, customers, and the environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Business Ethics is the study of business situations, activities and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed.",
