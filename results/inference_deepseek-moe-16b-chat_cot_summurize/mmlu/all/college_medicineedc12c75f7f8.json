            "content": " The correct answer is A. triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\n\nA codon is a sequence of three nucleotide bases in the genetic code that specifies a particular amino acid during protein synthesis. The genetic code is read in groups of three nucleotide bases, called codons, which specify the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.\n\nIn mRNA, the codons specify the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, while in DNA, the codons specify the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. The genetic code is universal, meaning that it is the same in all organisms.\n\nThe genetic code is read in both directions, meaning that the same codon can specify different amino acids depending on the reading frame. The reading frame is the position of the codon in the sequence of nucleotide bases.\n\nIn summary, codons are composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA, and they specify the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.",
