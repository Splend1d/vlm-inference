This is because these are the variables that can be accessed directly from the program's code, and thus can be used to determine if an object can be reached from a root set.\n\nDynamic memory allocation on the heap is also part of the root set, because the garbage collector needs to be able to identify all objects that have been allocated from the heap.\n\nLocal variables on the call stack are not part of the root set. This is because they are not directly accessible from the program's code, but rather are stored on the call stack during the execution of a procedure. The garbage collector does not need to be able to access these variables to determine if an object can be reached from a root set.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
