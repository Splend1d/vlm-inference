            "content": " The magnitude of the gravitational force on a satellite is constant if the orbit is circular. This is because the gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. In a circular orbit, the distance between the satellite and the planet remains constant, so the gravitational force remains constant as well. In a parabolic orbit, the distance between the satellite and the planet varies, so the gravitational force also varies. In an elliptical orbit, the distance between the satellite and the planet also varies, so the gravitational force also varies. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
