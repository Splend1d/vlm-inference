In the case of H3O+ and H2O, the base is H2O and the acid is H3O+. When H2O loses a proton, it becomes H3O+, and when H3O+ gains a proton, it becomes H2O. Therefore, H3O+ and H2O are a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\nThe other options are not conjugate acid-base pairs:\n\nA. HCl / NaOH: HCl is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base, so they do not form a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\nC. O2 / H2O: O2 is not an acid or a base, so it cannot form a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\nD. H+ / Cl\u2212: H+ is a proton and Cl\u2212 is a chloride ion, so they do not form a conjugate acid-base pair.",
