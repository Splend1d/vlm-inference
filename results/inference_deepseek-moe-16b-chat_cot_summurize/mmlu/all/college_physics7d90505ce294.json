            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the angle of incidence, which is given by:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = n1 / n2\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle of incidence, n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium (air), and n2 is the index of refraction of the second medium (oil).\n\nsin(\u03b8) = 480 nm / 1.2\n\n\u03b8 = arcsin(480 nm / 1.2)\n\n\u03b8 \u2248 18.3\u00b0\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the critical angle, which is given by:\n\nsin(\u03b8_c) = n2 / n1\n\nwhere \u03b8_c is the critical angle for total internal reflection.\n\nsin(\u03b8_c) = 1.6 / 1.2\n\n\u03b8_c \u2248 18.3\u00b0\n\nSince the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs, and the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the thickness of the film, which is given by:\n\nd = n2 * \u03bb / (2 * sin(\u03b8_r))\n\nwhere d is the thickness of the film, \u03bb is the wavelength of the light, and \u03b8_r is the angle of refraction.\n\nFor blue light (\u03bb = 480 nm), the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0, so:\n\nd = 1.6 * 480 nm / (2 * sin(90\u00b0))\n\nd = 1.6 * 480 nm / 1\n\nd \u2248 768 nm\n\nSince the minimum thickness of the oil film is not given, we can assume that the thickness is equal to the thickness of the film. Therefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film is 768 nm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 400 nm.",
