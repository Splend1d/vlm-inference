            "content": " The correct statement is B. Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure. This is the basic principle of the cohesion-tension theory, which explains the ascent of water in the xylem. The theory states that water moves from areas of high pressure (source region) to areas of low pressure (sink region) due to the cohesive forces between water molecules. This process is driven by the evaporation of water from the leaf mesophyll cells, which creates a gradient of water potential across the leaf. The water then moves from the source region to the sink region through the xylem, where it is transported to the roots for uptake and translocation throughout the plant.",
