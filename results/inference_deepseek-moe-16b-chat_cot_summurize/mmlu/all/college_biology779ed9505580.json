Seeds enclosed in ovaries.\n\nAngiosperms, also known as flowering plants, are characterized by the presence of seeds enclosed in ovaries, which are typically located within a fruit. This is in contrast to gymnosperms, which are seed-producing plants that do not have enclosed seeds.\n\nThe other options listed are not specific characteristics of angiosperms and are also found in other types of plants. For example, perennial growth is found in both angiosperms and gymnosperms, as well as in some non-flowering plants. True roots are found in both angiosperms and gymnosperms, as well as in some non-flowering plants. Apical growth is a term used to describe the growth of a plant from the tip, and is found in both angiosperms and gymnosperms, as well as in some non-flowering plants.",
