Speed: The fire engine is moving faster, so the sound waves it produces are traveling faster towards you.\n2. Frequency: The fire engine is getting closer, so the sound waves are reaching you more quickly. This means the frequency of the sound waves increases.\n3. Wavelength: The fire engine is getting closer, so the distance between the sound waves is shorter. This means the wavelength of the sound waves decreases.",
