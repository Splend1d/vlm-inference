            "content": " The products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports are:\n\nA. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\n\nDuring intense physical activity, the body's energy demands increase, leading to an increase in the production of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) as a byproduct of energy production. ADP is a molecule that stores energy in the form of high-energy bonds. When ADP is broken down, it releases energy in the form of phosphate bonds, which is used to fuel muscle contractions.\n\nAmmonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid are all products of ADP degradation. Ammonia is a waste product that is produced during the breakdown of amino acids for energy production. Hypoxanthine is a byproduct of the purine nucleotide metabolism, and uric acid is a waste product that is produced during the breakdown of purines.\n\nUrea and creatinine are also products of ADP degradation, but they are not increased in concentration during multiple sprint sports. Urea is a waste product that is produced during the breakdown of amino acids for energy production, and creatinine is a waste product that is produced during the breakdown of creatine, a high-energy compound that is stored in muscle tissue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.",
