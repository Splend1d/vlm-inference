Conduction, convection, and radioactivity are less significant factors in the energy balance of the Earth. Conduction is the transfer of heat within a material due to the movement of particles. Convection is the transfer of heat due to the movement of fluids, such as air or water. Radioactivity is the emission of energy in the form of radiation from the nucleus of an atom.",
