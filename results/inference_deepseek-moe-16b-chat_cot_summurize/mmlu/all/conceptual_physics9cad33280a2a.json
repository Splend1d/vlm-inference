This is because the mass of the nucleus is equal to the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons). When a nucleus undergoes fission or fusion, the number of nucleons remains the same, but their arrangement and energy state change. The kinetic energy of the nucleus may change, but the mass remains constant.",
