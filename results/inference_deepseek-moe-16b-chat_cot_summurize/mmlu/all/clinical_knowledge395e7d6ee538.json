Increasing protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day may not necessarily stimulate muscle growth and increase strength, as other factors such as exercise, rest, and overall diet also play a role. Amino acid supplements can provide the building blocks for protein synthesis, but they do not directly increase muscle strength and power. Muscle damage is induced by eccentric contractions, not shortening contractions.",
