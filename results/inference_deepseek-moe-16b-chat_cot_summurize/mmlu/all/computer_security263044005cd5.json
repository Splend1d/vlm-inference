            "content": " The security property that can address Alice and Bob's concern is Forward secrecy. Forward secrecy ensures that even if an adversary compromises a long-term key or certificate after the messages have been sent, the messages themselves cannot be decrypted. This is because new session keys are generated for each message, and the long-term key is not used to encrypt the messages.\n\nBackward secrecy, on the other hand, refers to the ability to decrypt messages that have already been sent, even if the long-term key is compromised. This is not a concern in this scenario, as the messages have already been sent and cannot be decrypted.\n\nAuthentication and deniability are not security properties, but rather mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity of messages and the denial of authorship, respectively. They do not address the concern of an adversary compromising a computer while Alice and Bob are taking the exam.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Forward secrecy.",
