Nociceptive pain is pain that results from actual or potential tissue damage, which causes the release of chemical mediators that stimulate nerve fibers to initiate pain signals to the brain. This type of pain is often described as sharp, aching, or throbbing, and it is often associated with tissue damage or inflammation.\n\nB. Pain resulting from pressure upon a nerve or group of nerves is called mechanical pain, not nociceptive pain.\nC. A disorder of a specific nerve or group of nerves resulting in the release of abnormal pain signals is called neuropathic pain, not nociceptive pain.\nD. Pain resulting from a disorder of the central nervous system, i.e. following a cerebral vascular accident, is called central pain, not nociceptive pain.",
