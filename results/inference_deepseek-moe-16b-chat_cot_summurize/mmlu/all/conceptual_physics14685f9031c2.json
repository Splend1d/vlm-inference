None of these.\n\nTo solve this question, we need to understand the concept of density. Density is defined as the mass of an object divided by its volume. Mathematically, it is represented as:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nNow, let's consider the given situation. If the volume of an object doubles, but the mass remains the same, the density will change. To find out how much it will change, we can use the formula for density:\n\nDensity = Mass / Volume\n\nIf the volume doubles, the new density can be calculated as:\n\nNew Density = Mass / (2 * Volume)\n\nSince the mass remains the same, the new density will be:\n\nNew Density = Mass / Volume\n\nComparing this with the original density, we can see that the new density is half of the original density. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Halve.",
