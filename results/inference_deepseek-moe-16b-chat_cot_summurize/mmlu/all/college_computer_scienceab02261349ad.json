Write-through and write-back are cache policies, and write-allocation is a policy used when a cache line is allocated and loaded on a write-miss.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The hit ratio depends on the specific access patterns and the cache size. In some cases, write-through may have a better hit ratio than write-back, and vice versa.\n\nB.
