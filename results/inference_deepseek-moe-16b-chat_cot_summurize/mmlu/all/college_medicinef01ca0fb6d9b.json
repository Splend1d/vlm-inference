The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated.\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall.\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.\n\nA. II only\nB. III only\nC. I and IV only\nD. I and III and IV only\n",

            "content": " The dependent variables in this experiment are the factors that are being manipulated or changed by the researchers, and the outcome that is being measured or observed. \n\nOption I, \"The amount the subjects were compensated,\" is not a dependent variable because it is not being manipulated or changed by the researchers. It is a constant factor that does not change throughout the experiment.\n\nOption II, \"The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts,\" is not a dependent variable because it is not being manipulated or changed by the researchers. It is a constant factor that does not change throughout the experiment.\n\nOption III, \"The number of facts the subjects can recall,\" is a dependent variable because it is the outcome that is being measured or observed. The researchers are changing the amount of time the subjects are given to learn the facts, and the number of facts they can recall is the outcome of this manipulation.\n\nOption IV, \"The time the subjects were given to learn the facts,\" is a dependent variable because it is the factor that is being manipulated or changed by the researchers. The researchers are changing the amount of time the subjects are given to learn the facts, and the number of facts they can recall is the outcome of this manipulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and III and IV only.",
