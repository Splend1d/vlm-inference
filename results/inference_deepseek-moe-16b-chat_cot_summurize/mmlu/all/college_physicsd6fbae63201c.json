            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the fringe visibility in a Michelson interferometer:\n\nFringe visibility = (n - 1) / (n + 1)\n\nwhere n is the index of refraction of the original gas.\n\nWe are given that 100 fringes are counted when the gas cell is evacuated. This means that the fringe visibility is 100/101 = 0.9901.\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the index of refraction of the original gas:\n\n(n - 1) / (n + 1) = 0.9901\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn - 1 = 0.9901n\nn = 1.00016\n\nTherefore, the index of refraction of the original gas is approximately 1.00016.
