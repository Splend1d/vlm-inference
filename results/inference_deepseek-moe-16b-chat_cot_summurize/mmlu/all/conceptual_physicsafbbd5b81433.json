This is because the surface area of an object is directly proportional to the square of its linear size, and the volume is directly proportional to the cube of its linear size. When you scale up an object by a factor of 3, the surface area increases by a factor of 3^2 = 9, and the volume increases by a factor of 3^3 = 27.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 9 and the volume by 27.",
