In this condition, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not close properly, allowing stomach contents to flow back into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and chest pain.\n\nB. Esophageal varices is a condition in which the veins in the esophagus become enlarged due to liver disease, not the incompetence of the esophageal sphincter.\n\nC. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the lining of the digestive tract, not the esophageal sphincter.\n\nD. Pyloric stenosis is a condition that affects the muscle at the outlet of the stomach, causing it to become narrow and leading to projectile vomiting. It is caused by a congenital abnormality and not by incompetence of the esophageal sphincter.",
