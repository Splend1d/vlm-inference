However, with a 30-km/h crosswind, the airplane's groundspeed will be reduced by the magnitude of the crosswind.\n\nThe magnitude of the crosswind is 30 km/h, so the groundspeed will be reduced by 30 km/h.\n\nTherefore, the groundspeed of the airplane is 40 km/h - 30 km/h = 10 km/h.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 30 km/h\nB. 40 km/h\nC. 50 km/h\nD. 60 km/h",
