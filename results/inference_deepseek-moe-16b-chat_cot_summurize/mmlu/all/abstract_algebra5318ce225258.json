By definition, G can be generated by n linearly independent elements, say g1, g2, ..., gn. For each i = 1, 2, ..., n, let Bi be the basis generated by g1, g2, ..., gi. Since G has an infinite number of elements, there must be at least one basis that is not a subset of another basis. Therefore, G has an infinite number of bases.\n\nStatement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\n\nProof: Let G be a free abelian group of rank at least 2. By statement 1, G has an infinite number of bases.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
