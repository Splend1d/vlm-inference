Homologous structures are similar structures that have evolved separately in different species, often due to similar functions. In this case, the wings of a bat and a butterfly have evolved from different ancestors, but they serve a similar purpose, which is to enable flight. The wings of a bat are modified forelimbs, while the wings of a butterfly are modified hindwings. The structure and function of the wings are different, but they have evolved from similar ancestral structures.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Analogous structures are structures that are similar in form and function but have evolved independently in different species. In this case, the wings of a bat and a butterfly are not analogous structures because they have evolved from similar ancestral structures.\n\nC. Vestigial structures are structures that are present in an organism but have lost their function due to evolution. In this case, the wings of a bat and a butterfly are not vestigial structures because they have not lost their function.\n\nD. Dissimilar in form and function is not a valid option for describing the wings of a bat and a butterfly. The wings of a bat and a butterfly are similar in form and function, as they both serve the purpose of enabling flight.",
