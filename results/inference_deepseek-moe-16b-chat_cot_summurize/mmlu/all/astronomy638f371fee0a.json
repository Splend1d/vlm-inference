            "content": " The correct answer is B. Metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.\n\nThe formation of terrestrial planets, such as Earth, is a complex process that involves the accumulation of materials in the early solar system. The process begins with the formation of the solar nebula, a rotating disk of gas and dust that surrounds the young sun. As the nebula cools and condenses, it forms solid particles called planetesimals, which eventually grow into planets.\n\nDuring this process, metals (such as iron and nickel) and silicates (such as olivine and pyroxene) are the first materials to condense. This is because metals are more dense than silicates, and therefore they sink towards the center of the nebula, where the temperature and pressure are highest. As the nebula continues to cool and condense, the metals continue to sink, eventually forming a core at the center of the planet.\n\nThe rocks that make up the rest of the planet's mantle and crust then accrete around the core, forming a solid planet. This is why terrestrial planet cores are mostly made of metal, and why the rest of the planet is made up of rock and other materials.",
