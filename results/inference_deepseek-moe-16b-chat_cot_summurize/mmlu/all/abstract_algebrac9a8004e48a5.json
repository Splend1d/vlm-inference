            "content": " To determine whether the statements are true or false, we will analyze each statement individually.\n\nStatement 1: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}.\n\nA ring homomorphism is a function f: R \u2192 S that preserves the ring operations (additively for the ring of integers and multiplicatively for the ring of integers modulo n). The kernel of a ring homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that are mapped to the identity element in the codomain.\n\nIf the kernel is {0}, then for every element in the kernel, the function f maps it to the identity element in the codomain. This means that the function f is one-to-one.\n\nConversely, if the function f is one-to-one, then for every element in the kernel, the function f maps it to the identity element in the codomain. Therefore, the kernel is {0}.\n\nHence, the first statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Q is an ideal in R.\n\nA ring R is a commutative ring with an identity element 0 and additive inverse for each element. A subset Q of R is called an ideal if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Q is closed under addition: a + b \u2208 Q for all a, b \u2208 Q.\n2. Q is closed under multiplication: a * b \u2208 Q for all a, b \u2208 Q.\n3. 0 \u2208 Q.\n\nThe set of rational numbers Q is a subgroup of the additive group of real numbers R. It is closed under addition and multiplication, and it contains the additive identity 0. Therefore, Q is an ideal in R.\n\nHence, the second statement is true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
