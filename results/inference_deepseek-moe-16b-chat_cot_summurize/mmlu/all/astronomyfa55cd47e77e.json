            "content": " The correct answer is B. by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\n\nJupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, and it is made up of gas, primarily hydrogen and helium. As it forms, the gravitational potential energy from the contracting gas is converted into thermal energy, which generates the internal heat that powers the planet's various processes. This is similar to how a rubber band contracts when you stretch it, and the energy is converted into thermal energy in the form of heat.\n\nOption A, nuclear fusion in the core, is not the correct answer because Jupiter does not have a solid core like the other gas giants, such as Saturn and Uranus. These planets do have a solid core, which is where nuclear fusion could occur.\n\nOption C, internal friction due to its high rotation rate, is not the correct answer because the rotation rate of Jupiter is not high enough to generate the internal heat needed to power the planet.\n\nOption D, chemical processes, is not the correct answer because Jupiter is primarily composed of gas, not solid materials that could undergo chemical reactions.",
