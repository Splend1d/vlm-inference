            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the definition of a linear transformation. A linear transformation is a function that preserves the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, for any two points A and B in the domain of the transformation and any scalar c, the following two properties hold:\n\n1. f(A + B) = f(A) + f(B)\n2. f(cA) = c * f(A)\n\nGiven that f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2, we can use these points to find the value of f(3, 5).\n\nFirst, let's find f(1, 1) + f(-1, 0):\nf(1, 1) = 1\nf(-1, 0) = 2\nf(1, 1) + f(-1, 0) = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nNow, let's find f(3, 5) using the same method:\nf(3, 5) = f(3, 0) + f(0, 5)\n\nSince f is a linear transformation, we can use the properties of addition and scalar multiplication to find f(3, 0) and f(0, 5):\n\nf(3, 0) = f(3, 3) = f(3, 0) + f(0, 3)\nf(0, 5) = f(0, 5) + f(0, 0)\n\nNow, let's use the given information to find f(3, 0) and f(0, 3):\n\nf(1, 1) + f(-1, 0) = 3\nf(1, 1) + f(0, 3) = 3\n\nSince f(1, 1) = 1 and f(0, 3) = 0, we have:\n\n1 + 0 = 3\n\nThis equation is not true, which means that the given information is not sufficient to determine the value of f(3, 5). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nC. 0",
