            "content": " The greedy algorithm is a simple algorithm that makes the optimal choice at each step based on the current state of the problem. It is not always the best choice for solving problems, but it can be effective in certain cases.\n\nI. Finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights: The Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can solve this problem. It works by selecting the next edge that connects a subset of the vertices and whose total weight is less than or equal to the total weight of the edges already included in the spanning tree.\n\nII. Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph: The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can solve this problem. It works by iteratively adding vertices to the current clique and checking if the new vertex can be added to the clique.\n\nIII. Finding a maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph with positive-integer edge capacities: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can solve this problem. It works by finding augmenting paths in the graph and increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. I and II only.",
