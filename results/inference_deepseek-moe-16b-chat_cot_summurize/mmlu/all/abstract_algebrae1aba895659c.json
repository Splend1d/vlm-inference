The field Q_2 is the set of integers modulo 2, which is an extension of the field Z_2. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\n\nThis statement is a well-known result in algebra known as the Factor Theorem. It states that if a polynomial f(x) has a root a in a field K, then the polynomial (x-a) is a factor of f(x). Therefore, every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A. True, True.",
