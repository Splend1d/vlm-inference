            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V ) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective.\n\nA linear transformation is a function that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, for any two vectors u, v in V and any scalar c in the field, the following properties hold:\n\n1. T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)\n2. T(cu) = cT(u)\n\nNow, let's consider the given conditions: dim(V) < dim(W) < 1. This means that V has dimension less than W, and W has dimension less than 1. Since W has dimension less than 1, it must be a 1-dimensional vector space, which means that W is isomorphic to the field of real numbers.\n\nNow, let's consider the definition of a linear transformation: T: V -> W is a linear transformation if and only if T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) and T(cu) = cT(u) for all u, v in V and c in the field.\n\nSince W is a 1-dimensional vector space, it is isomorphic to the field of real numbers. Therefore, T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) and T(cu) = cT(u) for all u, v in V and c in the field. This means that T is a linear transformation.\n\nHowever, just because T is a linear transformation does not necessarily mean that it is injective. Injective means that the function maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain. Since T is a linear transformation, it preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. Therefore, T is injective if and only if it maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine whether T maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain, we cannot conclude that T must be injective.\n\nStatement 2: Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nA linear transformation is a function that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

This means that T is a linear transformation.\n\nA linear transformation is a bijection if and only if it is both injective and surjective. Since T is a linear transformation, it preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. Therefore, T is injective if and only if it maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine whether T maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain, we cannot conclude that T is injective.\n\nHowever, if T is injective, then it is a bijection. This is because a bijection is a function that is both injective and surjective. Since T is injective, it maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain. Therefore, T is a bijection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
