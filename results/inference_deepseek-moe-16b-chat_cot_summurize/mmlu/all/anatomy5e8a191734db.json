The atrioventricular bundle, also known as the bundle of His, is formed of autonomic nerve processes and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. It does not form one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles. The Purkinje fibres are responsible for the electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles, not the atrioventricular bundle.",
