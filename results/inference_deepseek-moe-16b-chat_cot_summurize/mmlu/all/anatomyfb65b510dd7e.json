This is because the mucosa is a continuation of the gingiva, which is a pink tissue that covers the alveolar bone. The mucogingival junction is the point where the mucosa and gingiva meet, and it is usually not visible because the gingiva is pink and the mucosa is a lighter pink. Therefore, the correct answer is A. light pink in colour on both sides of the mucogingingival junction.",
