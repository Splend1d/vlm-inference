Every field is a ring because it satisfies the ring axioms of closure, associativity, and commutativity.\n\nStatement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity. This statement is also true. The multiplicative identity in a ring is an element that, when multiplied by any other element in the ring, yields that other element. For example, in the ring of integers, the number 1 is the multiplicative identity because 1 * n = n for any integer n.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
