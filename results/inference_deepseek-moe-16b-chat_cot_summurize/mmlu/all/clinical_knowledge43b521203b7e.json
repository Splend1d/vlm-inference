Actin is a filamentous protein that forms the core of the thin filaments in muscle cells. Myosin is a motor protein that binds to actin and uses ATP to generate force and generate muscle contraction. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins that bind to actin and myosin and help control the rate of muscle contraction.",
