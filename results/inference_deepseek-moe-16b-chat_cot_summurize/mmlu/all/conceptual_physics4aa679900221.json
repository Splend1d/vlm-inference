            "content": " Newton's law of cooling applies to objects that cool down. The law states that the rate of cooling of an object is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings, and inversely proportional to the sum of the object's heat capacity and the heat capacity of its surroundings. This means that as the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings decreases, the rate of cooling also decreases. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
