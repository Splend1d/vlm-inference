Every ideal in a ring is a subset of the ring that is closed under the ring's operations (addition and multiplication). It is also a subring because it contains the additive identity and is closed under multiplication.\n\nStatement 2: Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring. This statement is false. A subring of a ring is a subset of the ring that is also a ring. It is not necessarily true that every subring of a ring is an ideal of the ring. For example, consider the ring of integers under addition, and let's take the subring of integers divisible by 3. This subring is not an ideal of the ring of integers under addition because it does not contain the additive inverse of 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
