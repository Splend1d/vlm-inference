When light passes through a diffraction grating, the light is split into its constituent wavelengths, and these wavelengths interfere with each other. This interference pattern can be observed as a series of bright and dark fringes on a screen placed behind the grating. The intensity of the fringes depends on the angle of incidence and the wavelength of the light, and the grating can be used to analyze the composition of light sources or to disperse light into its constituent wavelengths.",
