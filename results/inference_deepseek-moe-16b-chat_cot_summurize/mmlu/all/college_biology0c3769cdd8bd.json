This change in the protein can result in a new phenotype, or observable characteristic, of the organism.\n\nOption A, \"A different polypeptide is produced,\" is the correct answer because it directly relates to the production of a new protein as a result of a DNA mutation. The other options, B, C, and D, are not directly related to the expression of a new phenotype and do not explain how mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype.",
