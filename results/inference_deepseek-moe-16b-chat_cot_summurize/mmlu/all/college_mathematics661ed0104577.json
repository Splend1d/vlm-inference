There are two possible outcomes for each toss of the coin: either the player wins the game or they lose. Since the coin is fair, the probability of winning is equal to the probability of losing.\n\nLet's consider the possible outcomes of the game:\n\n1. The first player wins the game on the first toss.\n2. The first player wins the game on the second toss.\n3. The first player wins the game on the third toss.\n4. The first player wins the game on the fourth toss.\n\nSince the coin is fair, the probability of winning on the first toss is 1/2, and the probability of winning on the second toss is also 1/2. The probability of winning on the third toss is 1/4, and the probability of winning on the fourth toss is 1/8.\n\nTo find the probability of winning the game, we need to add up the probabilities of all possible outcomes:\n\n1/2 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is 1/2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
