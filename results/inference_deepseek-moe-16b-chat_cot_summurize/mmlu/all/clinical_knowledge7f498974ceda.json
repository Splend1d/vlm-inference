            "content": " The correct answer is C. diastole and systole.\n\nThe cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events that occur in the heart during one complete heartbeat. It consists of two main phases: diastole and systole.\n\nDiastole is the phase when the heart is relaxed and filling with blood. During diastole, the heart muscle relaxes, the heart valves between the atria and ventricles close, and the ventricular walls become thinner. This allows the ventricles to fill with blood, increasing their volume.\n\nSystole is the phase when the heart contracts and pumps blood. During systole, the heart muscle contracts, the heart valves between the ventricles and arteries open, and the ventricular walls become thicker. This allows the ventricles to contract and pump blood into the arteries, which then carry the blood to the body's tissues.\n\nThe other phases mentioned in the options are not part of the cardiac cycle. Systole and diastole are the main phases of the cardiac cycle, and contraction and relaxation refer to the muscle contractions that occur during these phases. Rest is not a phase of the cardiac cycle, but rather a period between heartbeats when the heart is not actively pumping blood.",
