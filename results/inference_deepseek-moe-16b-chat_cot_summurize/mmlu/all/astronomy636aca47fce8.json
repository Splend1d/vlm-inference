            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to understand the Doppler effect, which is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave (such as light) when the source of the wave and the observer are moving relative to each other.\n\nThe Doppler effect is most famously observed in the context of sound waves, where it causes a change in the pitch of a car's horn as the car passes by. However, it can also apply to light waves, and it is the principle behind the redshift and blueshift observed in the spectra of stars.\n\nA redshift occurs when the source of the light is moving away from the observer, and a blueshift occurs when the source is moving toward the observer. The amount of redshift or blueshift is proportional to the relative velocity of the source and the observer.\n\nIn this case, the laboratory measurement of the wavelength of the hydrogen line in the star's spectrum is 486.1 nm, and the observed wavelength in the star's spectrum is 485.9 nm. This indicates that the star is moving away from us, since the observed wavelength is shorter than the laboratory measurement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The star is moving away from us.",
