            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use stoichiometry. The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nC2H6 + 7/2 O2 \u2192 2 CO2 + 3 H2O\n\nWe can use this equation to find the number of moles of carbon dioxide produced. First, we need to find the molar mass of carbon dioxide. The molar mass of CO2 is 44 amu (atomic weight of carbon + 3 times the atomic weight of oxygen).\n\nNow, we can use the balanced equation to find the number of moles of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n2 mol CO2 * (44 amu CO2 / 1 mol CO2) = 88 amu CO2\n\nNext, we can use the balanced equation to find the number of moles of ethane gas:\n\n1 mol C2H6 * (12 amu C / 1 mol C2H6) = 12 amu C\n\nNow, we can use the balanced equation to find the number of moles of ethane gas:\n\n12 amu C / 44 amu CO2 = 0.2727 amu C / amu CO2\n\nFinally, we can use the balanced equation to find the number of grams of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n0.2727 amu C / amu CO2 * 88 amu CO2 = 23.62 amu C\n\nNow, we can use the molar mass of carbon to find the number of grams of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n23.62 amu C * (12 amu C / 1 amu C2H6) = 191.44 amu C2H6\n\nNow, we can use the balanced equation to find the number of grams of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n191.44 amu C2H6 / 12 amu C2H6/g = 15.95 g C2H6\n\nNow, we can use the balanced equation to find the number of grams of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n15.95 g C2H6 * (1 mol CO2 / 44 amu CO2) = 0.355 g CO2\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 15.95 grams of carbon dioxide would result.",
