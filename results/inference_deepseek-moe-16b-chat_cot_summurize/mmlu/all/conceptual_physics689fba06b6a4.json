This is known as Coulomb's Law.\n\nSo, if the distance between the two particles is halved, the force between them will be doubled. If the distance is doubled, the force will be divided by 4.\n\nTherefore, if the distance is halved, the force will be doubled.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. twice as strong",
