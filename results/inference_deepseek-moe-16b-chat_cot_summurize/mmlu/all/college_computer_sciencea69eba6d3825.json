To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined.

The hash function is applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is set to true. This means that if a word is in the dictionary, its corresponding entry in the hash table will be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nI. true means the word was in the dictionary.\nThis statement is correct. If a word's corresponding entry in the hash table is true, it means the word was in the dictionary.\n\nII. false means the word was not in the dictionary.\nThis statement is also correct. If a word's corresponding entry in the hash table is false, it means the word was not in the dictionary.\n\nIII. Hash table size should increase with document size.\nThis statement is not necessarily correct. The size of the hash table does not directly affect the accuracy of the spelling checker. However, a larger hash table can handle larger documents more efficiently.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. I and II only.",
