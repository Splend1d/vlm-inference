G has a vertex with no incoming edge.\n- In a DAG, each vertex must have at least one incoming edge. Therefore, it is not possible for a vertex to have no incoming edge. This statement is false.\n\nII. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.\n- In a DAG, each vertex must have at least one outgoing edge. Therefore, it is not possible for a vertex to have no outgoing edge. This statement is false.\n\nIII. G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge.\n- In a DAG, an isolated vertex is possible. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. III only.",
