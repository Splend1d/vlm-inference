I/O ports are placed at addresses on the bus and are accessed just like other memory locations.\n\nMemory-mapped I/O is a technique where I/O devices are assigned memory addresses, and the CPU can access them directly through memory-mapped I/O instructions. This allows the CPU to access I/O devices as if they were regular memory locations, which can improve system performance.\n\nA. The computer provides special instructions for manipulating I/O ports.\nThis is not accurate. While some systems may have special instructions for I/O, memory-mapped I/O does not require special instructions.\n\nC. To perform an I/O operation, it is sufficient to place the data in an address register and call the channel to perform the operation.\nThis is not accurate. Memory-mapped I/O requires the CPU to access the I/O device through memory-mapped I/O instructions, not just by placing data in an address register.\n\nD. Ports are referenced only by memory-mapped instructions of the computer and are located at hardwired memory locations.\nThis is not accurate. While memory-mapped I/O does involve memory-mapped instructions, the I/O ports are not necessarily hardwired memory locations. They can be located anywhere in memory, and the specific location can depend on the system configuration.",
