            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the free induction decay (FID) and the formula for the exponential relaxation.\n\nThe FID is given by:\n\nM(t) = M0 * e^(-t/T2)\n\nwhere M(t) is the magnetization at time t, M0 is the initial magnetization, and T2 is the transverse relaxation time.\n\nWe are given that the amplitude of the FID drops to 25% of its initial intensity after 1.0 s. This means that:\n\nM(1.0) = 0.25 * M0\n\nNow, we can solve for T2:\n\nM0 * e^(-1.0/T2) = 0.25 * M0\n\ne^(-1.0/T2) = 0.25\n\nTo solve for T2, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-1.0/T2 = ln(0.25)\n\n-1.0/T2 = -0.301\n\nNow, we can solve for T2:\n\nT2 = 3.31 s\n\nTherefore, the value of T2 is 3.31 s, which corresponds to option C.",
