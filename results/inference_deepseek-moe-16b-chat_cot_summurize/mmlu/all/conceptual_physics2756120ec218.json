            "content": " The metal detectors people walk through at airports operate via Coulomb's law. \n\nCoulomb's law, also known as Coulomb's inverse-square law, is a law of physics that describes the force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges, as well as the electric field between them. In the context of a metal detector, this law is used to detect the presence of metal objects by measuring the electric field around the detector.\n\nWhen a person walks through the metal detector, they are typically required to hold their arms out to the side and walk slowly through a set of detectors. The detectors use a combination of electromagnetic induction and eddy currents to detect the presence of metal objects.\n\nWhen a person wearing a metal object, such as a belt buckle or a piece of jewelry, passes through the detector, the metal object disrupts the magnetic field around the detector. This disruption creates an electric current in the detector, which is then measured and analyzed by the detector's electronics.\n\nIf the detector detects the presence of metal, it will typically sound an alarm or display a message indicating that the person needs to be further searched. The alarm is generated by a small electrical circuit that is triggered by the presence of metal, which then completes a circuit and activates the alarm.\n\nIn summary, the metal detectors people walk through at airports operate via Coulomb's law, which is a law of physics that describes the force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges, as well as the electric field between them.",
