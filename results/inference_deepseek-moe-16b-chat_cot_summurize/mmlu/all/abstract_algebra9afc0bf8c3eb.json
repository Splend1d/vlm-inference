            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.\nA cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. If we have a cyclic group G with generator g, and we apply a homomorphism f to it, we get a new group H. The image of g under f, denoted as f(g), is an element of H. If f is a homomorphism, then f(g^n) = f(g)^n for all n, where g^n is the nth power of g. This means that f(g) generates a subgroup of H, and since H is a group, this subgroup must be equal to H. Therefore, H is generated by f(g), and H is cyclic. So, the statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\nAn Abelian group is a group in which the binary operation is commutative. If we have an Abelian group G and we apply a homomorphism f to it, we get a new group H. The image of an element a in G under f, denoted as f(a), is an element of H. If f is a homomorphism, then f(a*b) = f(a)*f(b) for all a, b in G. This means that f preserves the group operation, and since H is a group, it must be Abelian. So, the statement is true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A. True, True.",
