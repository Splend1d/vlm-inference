            "content": " To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, we need to find the dimension of the vector space generated by the elements of the extension over Q.\n\nLet's consider the elements of the extension:\n\n1. sqrt(2) = (1/2, 1/2)\n2. sqrt(3) = (1/2 + 1/2*sqrt(2), 1/2 - 1/2*sqrt(2))\n\nNow, let's find the dimension of the vector space generated by these elements.\n\nThe first element is already in Q, so it doesn't contribute to the dimension.\n\nFor the second element, we can write it as (a + b*sqrt(2), c + d*sqrt(2)), where a, b, c, d are in Q.\n\nNow, we can express the second element as a linear combination of the first element:\n\n(1/2 + 1/2*sqrt(2), 1/2 - 1/2*sqrt(2)) = (a + b*sqrt(2), c + d*sqrt(2))\n\nComparing the corresponding coordinates, we get:\n\n1/2 = a\n1/2 = c\n1/2*sqrt(2) = b*sqrt(2)\n1/2*sqrt(2) = d*sqrt(2)\n\nFrom the first two equations, we can solve for a and c:\n\na = 1/2\nc = 1/2\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the third and fourth equations:\n\n1/2*sqrt(2) = b*sqrt(2)\n1/2*sqrt(2) = d*sqrt(2)\n\nDividing both sides by sqrt(2), we get:\n\nb = 1/sqrt(2)\nd = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the second element can be expressed as:\n\n(1/2, 1/2) = (1/2, 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))*sqrt(2)\n\nThis shows that the vector space generated by the elements of the extension over Q is 1-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0",
