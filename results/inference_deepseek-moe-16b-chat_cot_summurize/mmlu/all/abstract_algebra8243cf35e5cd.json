There are groups of order p^2 where p is prime that are not Abelian. For example, consider the dihedral group D_4, which has order 8 (p^2) and is not Abelian.\n\nStatement 2: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n\nThis statement is also false. A Sylow p-subgroup is not necessarily normal in G if it is not the unique Sylow p-subgroup. For example, consider the group G = S_3, the symmetric group on 3 elements. The Sylow 2-subgroups of G are isomorphic to either Z_2 x Z_2 or Z_4, and neither of these is normal in G.\n\nTherefore, both statements are false, so the correct answer is D.",
