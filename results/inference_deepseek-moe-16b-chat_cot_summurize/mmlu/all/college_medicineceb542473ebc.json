            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of Bernoulli's equation, which states that the sum of pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy is constant along a streamline.\n\nLet's denote the starting velocity as v1, the final velocity as v2, the pressure as P, the area of the nozzle as A, and the area of the hose as A0.\n\nThe equation for Bernoulli's principle is:\n\nP1 + (1/2)mv1^2 + mgy1 = P2 + (1/2)mv2^2 + mgy2\n\nSince the pressure is constant, we can write:\n\nP1 + (1/2)mv1^2 + mgy1 = P2 + (1/2)mv2^2 + mgy2\n\nWe are given that the area of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the hose, so A2 = 3A0.\n\nWe are also given that the starting velocity is 2 m/s, so v1 = 2 m/s.\n\nThe final velocity is not given, so we will represent it as v2.\n\nThe area of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the hose, so A2 = (1/3)A0.\n\nThe final velocity can be found using the equation:\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * P2) / m)\n\nSince the pressure is constant, we can write:\n\nP2 = P1\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * P) / m)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of P1, P2, and m into the equation:\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + (1/2)mv1^2 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nSince the pressure is constant, we can write:\n\nP1 + (1/2)mv1^2 + mgy1 = P1 + (1/2)mv2^2 + mgy2\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + (1/2)v1^2 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + (1/2) * 2^2 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 4 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nSince the area of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the hose, we can write:\n\nA2 = (1/3)A0\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + (1/2)v1^2 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + (1/2) * 2^2 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 4 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 4 + m(2*9.81*1))) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 4 + 19.62)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 23.62)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * P1 + 47.24) / m)\n\nSince the area of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the hose, we can write:\n\nA2 = (1/3)A0\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + (1/2)v1^2 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + (1/2) * 2^2 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 4 + mgy1)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 4 + m(2*9.81*1))) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 4 + 19.62)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * (P1 + 23.62)) / m)\n\nv2 = sqrt((2 * P1 + 47.24) / m)\n\nSince the area of the nozzle is ",
