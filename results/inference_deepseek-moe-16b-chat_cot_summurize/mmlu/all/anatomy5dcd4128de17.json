This is to ensure that the needle does not penetrate the pterygoid canal, which is a potential pathway for the nerve. The needle is directed towards the mental foramen, which is located at the medial aspect of the ramus of the mandible. The needle is then directed slightly posteriorly and medially to avoid the pterygoid canal.",
