This region is located at a distance from the star where the temperature is not too hot nor too cold for water to exist in its liquid state. The habitable zone is important for the development of life as we know it, as liquid water is a necessary component for life as we know it.\n\nThe other options are not accurate definitions of the habitable zone. Option B is too narrow, as the habitable zone is not limited to just humans, but could potentially support a wide range of life forms. Option C is not a defining characteristic of the habitable zone, as the temperature of the star and the distance from the star are more important factors. Option D is also too narrow, as the habitable zone is not limited to just life, but could potentially support a wide range of life forms.",
