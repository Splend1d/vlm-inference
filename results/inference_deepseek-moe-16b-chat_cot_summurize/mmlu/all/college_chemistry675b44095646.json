The greater the electrostatic force of attraction, the higher the lattice enthalpy.\n\nAmong the given options, MgO has the greatest lattice enthalpy. This is because MgO has a higher charge difference between Mg2+ and O2- ions compared to MgS and NaF. The greater the charge difference, the stronger the electrostatic force of attraction between the ions, resulting in a higher lattice enthalpy.",
