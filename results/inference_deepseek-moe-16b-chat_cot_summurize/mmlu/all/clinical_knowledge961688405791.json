This results in an overestimation of the actual blood pressure. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Accurately estimating blood pressure is not affected by the position of the arm.\nC. An auscultatory gap can occur when there is a delay between the Korotkoff sounds and the disappearance of the blood pressure waveform, but it is not related to the position of the arm.\nD. Overestimating the blood pressure is the correct answer, but it is not the most specific option.",
