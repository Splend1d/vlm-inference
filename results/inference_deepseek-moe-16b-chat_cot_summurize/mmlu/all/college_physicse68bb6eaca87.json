            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative velocity. When an object is released from a moving object, the relative velocity between the object and the moving object is the sum of their individual velocities.\n\nIn this case, the airplane is traveling due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s, and the payload is released from the airplane. The relative velocity between the airplane and the payload is the sum of their individual velocities in the north direction and the eastward direction.\n\nSince the airplane is traveling due north, its velocity in the north direction is 100 m/s. The eastward direction is the direction of the release of the payload, so the velocity of the payload in the eastward direction is 0 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the relative velocity between the airplane and the payload in the north direction is 100 m/s, and in the eastward direction is 0 m/s.\n\nThe total relative velocity between the airplane and the payload is the sum of their individual velocities in the north direction and the eastward direction.\n\nTotal relative velocity = 100 m/s (north) + 0 m/s (east) = 100 m/s north.\n\nSince the airplane is traveling due north, the velocity of the payload relative to the airplane is 100 m/s north.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down.",
