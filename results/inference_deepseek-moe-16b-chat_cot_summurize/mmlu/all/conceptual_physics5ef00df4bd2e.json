The mass of each of these nuclei is less than the mass of the original iron nucleus. This is because when the nucleus splits, some of the mass is converted into energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments. This mass is lost and is not present in the fission fragments. Therefore, the mass per nucleon of the fission fragments is less than the mass per nucleon of the original iron nucleus.",
