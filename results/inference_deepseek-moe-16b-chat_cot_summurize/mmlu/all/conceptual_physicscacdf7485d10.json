As a result, the light wave changes its direction and speed. This phenomenon is responsible for many optical phenomena, such as the bending of light through a lens or the splitting of light into its component colors by a prism.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nB. Intensity: Refraction does not change the intensity of a wave.\nC. Frequency: Refraction does not change the frequency of a wave.\nD. Amplitude: Refraction does not change the amplitude of a wave.",
