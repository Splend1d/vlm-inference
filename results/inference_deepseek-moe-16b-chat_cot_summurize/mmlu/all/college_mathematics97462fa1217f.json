            "content": " To find the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin, we first need to find the normal vector to the plane. The normal vector is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation of the plane. In this case, the normal vector is (2, 1, 3).\n\nNext, we need to find the point on the plane that is closest to the origin. We can do this by finding the projection of the origin onto the plane. The projection of a point (x, y, z) onto a plane with normal vector (a, b, c) is given by the formula:\n\nproj_n(P) = (x, y, z) - ((a * x + b * y + c * z) / ||(a, b, c)||^2) * (a, b, c)\n\nIn our case, the origin is (0, 0, 0) and the normal vector is (2, 1, 3). So, we need to find the value of t such that:\n\n(0, 0, 0) + t * (2, 1, 3) = (x, y, z)\n\nThis gives us the following system of equations:\n\n0 = 2t\n0 = t\n0 = 3t\n\nSolving this system, we find that t = 0. So, the projection of the origin onto the plane is (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the point on the plane that is closest to the origin by plugging t = 0 into the formula for the projection:\n\nproj_n(P) = (0, 0, 0) - ((2 * 0 + 1 * 0 + 3 * 0) / ||(2, 1, 3)||^2) * (2, 1, 3)\nproj_n(P) = (0, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 0)\nproj_n(P) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSo, the coordinates of the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin are (0, 0, 0). Therefore, the answer is A.",
