            "content": " When a spinning system contracts in the absence of an external torque, its rotational speed increases and its angular momentum may increase or decrease. The relationship between rotational speed and angular momentum is given by the equation L = I\u03c9, where L is the angular momentum, I is the moment of inertia, and \u03c9 is the rotational speed. As the rotational speed increases, the angular momentum may increase if the moment of inertia remains constant, or it may decrease if the moment of inertia decreases. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",
