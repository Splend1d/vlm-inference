            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the period of a simple pendulum, which is given by:\n\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g)\n\nwhere T is the period, L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWe are given that the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A. Therefore, we can write:\n\nT_B = 2T_A\n\nSubstituting the formula for the period, we get:\n\n2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)\n\nDividing both sides by 2\u03c0, we get:\n\n\u221a(L_B/g) = \u221a(L_A/g)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\nL_B/g = L_A/g\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\nL_B = L_A\n\nTherefore, the length of pendulum B is equal to the length of pendulum A.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. L_B = L_A",
