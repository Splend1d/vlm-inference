            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the properties of groups.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a group. A group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a * b, is also in G.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that, for all a in G, the operation satisfies a * e = e * a = a.\n4. Inverse element: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's consider the given condition: (ab)^-1 = a^-1b^-1, for all a, b in G. This condition is saying that the inverse of the product of two elements is the product of their inverses.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nA. commutative semi group: A commutative semi-group is a set equipped with an operation that satisfies the commutative and associative properties, but not necessarily the identity and inverse element properties. However, the given condition implies that G satisfies the identity and inverse element properties, so this option is not correct.\n\nB. abelian group: An abelian group is a group in which the operation is commutative. The given condition implies that the operation is commutative, so this option is correct.\n\nC. non-abelian group: A non-abelian group is a group in which the operation is not commutative. Since the given condition implies that the operation is commutative, this option is not correct.\n\nD. None of these: This option is not correct because the given condition implies that G is an abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. abelian group.",
