Rash.\n\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause a range of symptoms, including difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and a drop in blood pressure. While all of the symptoms listed can occur during an anaphylactic reaction, rash is not a common symptom. In fact, it is not listed as a symptom in the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology's criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis.\n\nOther symptoms of anaphylaxis include:\n\n* Stridor: A high-pitched, wheezing sound that occurs when the airways become narrowed during an anaphylactic reaction.\n* Bradycardia: A slow heart rate, which can occur when the body's response to an allergen causes the vagus nerve to be stimulated, leading to a decrease in heart rate.\n* Severe wheeze: A high-pitched, whistling sound that occurs when airways become narrowed during an anaphylactic reaction.\n* Low blood pressure: A drop in blood pressure that can occur during an anaphylactic reaction, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and shock.\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately, as anaphylaxis can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.",
