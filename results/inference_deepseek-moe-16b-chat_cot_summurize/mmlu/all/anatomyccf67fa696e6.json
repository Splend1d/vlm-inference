The spleen is an organ located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and is responsible for filtering blood and removing old or damaged red and white blood cells. In cases of severe blunt trauma, the spleen is at a higher risk of being damaged due to its location and the force of the impact.\n\nThe appendix, gallbladder, and urinary bladder are all located in different regions of the abdomen and are not typically involved in blunt trauma. The appendix is a small, finger-shaped organ located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, the gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located under the liver in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and the urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular organ in the pelvis that stores and releases urine.",
