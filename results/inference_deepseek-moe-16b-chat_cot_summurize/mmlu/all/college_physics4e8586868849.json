The weight of the coin can be calculated using the formula:\n\nmg = m * g\n\nwhere m is the mass of the coin and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of the coin is not given, so we will assume a value of 1 gram (m = 1 g). The acceleration due to gravity can be calculated using the formula:\n\ng = 9.81 m/s^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the gravitational force acting on the coin:\n\nmg = 1 g * 9.81 m/s^2 = 9.81 N\n\nNow, we can plug the values of \u03bc_s, mg, \u03bd, and r into the formula for d:\n\nd = (0.30 * 9.81 N * 1 g * 11.12 rad/s^2) / (2 * (11.12 rad/s)^2)\n\nd = (0.30 * 9.81 * 1) / (2 * 121.44)\n\nd = 2.943 / 242.88\n\nd \u2248 0.121 m\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is approximately 0.121 meters, which corresponds to option C.",
