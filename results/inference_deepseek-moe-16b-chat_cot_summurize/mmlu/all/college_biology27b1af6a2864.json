This is because the hypothesis suggests that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects, and this can only be tested by removing the insects and observing the subsequent behavior of the ants.\n\nRemoving the ants themselves would not provide any information about their defense behavior towards leaf-feeding insects, as they would not be present to defend the plant. Removing the oil-rich bodies would not provide any information about the ants' defense behavior, as the hypothesis suggests that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects, not by producing oil-rich bodies. Removing the thorns would not provide any information about the ants' defense behavior, as the hypothesis suggests that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects, not by living in the thorns.",
