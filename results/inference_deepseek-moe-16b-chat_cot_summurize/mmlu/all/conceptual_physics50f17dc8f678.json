The spectrum of a star can be analyzed to determine its chemical composition, including the presence of various elements such as hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, and iron. By studying the spectrum of a star, astrophysicists can identify the elements in the outer layers of the star and determine the star's temperature, surface gravity, and other properties. Therefore, the correct answer is D. spectrum.",
