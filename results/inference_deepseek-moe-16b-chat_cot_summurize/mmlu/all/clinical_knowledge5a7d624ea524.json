Tilted to the left to keep the heart perfused.\n\nCPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a lifesaving technique that is used when a person's heart stops beating. The goal of CPR is to circulate blood and oxygen throughout the body, especially to the brain, until medical professionals can take over.\n\nWhen positioning a patient for CPR, it is important to keep in mind that the heart is on the left side of the body and is perfused by the left subclavian artery. Therefore, tilting the patient to the left can help maintain blood flow to the heart and brain.\n\nPositioning the patient flat on a firm surface is not ideal, as it can restrict breathing and circulation. Positioning the patient on the floor with the legs raised is also not recommended, as it can obstruct the airway and make it difficult to perform CPR.\n\nPositioning the patient in a semi-recumbent posture is not specifically recommended for CPR. However, it may be necessary to reposition the patient during CPR if they are not responding to the chest compressions.\n\nIn summary, the best position for performing CPR is to tilt the patient to the left to keep the heart perfused.",
