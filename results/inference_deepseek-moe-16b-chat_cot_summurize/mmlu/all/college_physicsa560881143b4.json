            "content": " The correct answer is B. The Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin, such as electrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In the case of helium atoms, this means that there can be no more than two electrons in the same quantum state.\n\nWhen the two electrons in a helium atom have antiparallel spins, they are in a para-state. This means that they are in the same quantum state, which is energetically unfavorable. On the other hand, when the two electrons have parallel spins, they are in an ortho-state, which means they are in different quantum states. This is energetically favorable, as it allows for more freedom in the arrangement of the electrons.\n\nTherefore, the observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle.",
