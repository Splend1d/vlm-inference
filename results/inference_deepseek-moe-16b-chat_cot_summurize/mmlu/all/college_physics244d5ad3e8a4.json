            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation and length contraction in special relativity.\n\n1. Time dilation: The time measured in the rest frame (2.0 ms) is different from the time measured in the lab frame (0.60c * 2.0 ms = 1.20 ms). This is because the particle is moving at a speed close to the speed of light in the lab frame, and time dilation occurs.\n\n2. Length contraction: The length of the particle in the rest frame (0.0 m) is different from the length of the particle in the lab frame (0.60c * 0.0 m = 0.0 m). This is because the particle is moving at a speed close to the speed of light in the lab frame, and length contraction occurs.\n\nNow, we can use the Lorentz transformation to find the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame:\n\nx' = \u03b3(x - vt)\n\nwhere x' is the position in the lab frame, x is the position in the rest frame, v is the speed of the particle in the lab frame, and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor (1/\u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)).\n\nx' = \u03b3(x - vt)\nx' = \u03b3(0 - 0.60c * 2.0 ms)\nx' = \u03b3(0 - 1.20 ms)\nx' = -1.20 ms\n\nSince the position in the lab frame is negative, this means that the particle has not yet reached its final position in the lab frame. Therefore, the particle has not yet decayed.\n\nHowever, we can still find the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame:\n\nx' = -1.20 ms\n\nSince the distance is negative, this means that the particle has not yet reached its final position in the lab frame. Therefore, the particle has not yet decayed.\n\nHowever, we can still find the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame:\n\nx' = -1.20 ms\n\nSince the distance is negative, this means that the particle has not yet reached its final position in the lab frame.
