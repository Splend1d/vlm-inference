However, if P is invertible, then its inverse must also be a linear transformation. But since P is a linear transformation of a finite-dimensional real vector space, its inverse must also be a linear transformation. This means that P is a diagonalizable transformation, which contradicts the given information that P is not diagonalizable. Therefore, P cannot be invertible.\n\nII. P is diagonalizable.\nAs we concluded in part I, P cannot be invertible, which means it cannot be diagonalizable. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\nSince P^2 = P, we know that P is not the zero transformation. However, if P is the identity transformation, then P^2 = P would imply that P is the identity transformation, which contradicts the given information that P is not the identity transformation. Therefore, P must be either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. III only.",
