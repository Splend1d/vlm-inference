This structure is the basic repeating unit of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA, proteins, and other molecules that make up the chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell. Chromatin is the material of which chromosomes are composed, and it is responsible for the compact packaging of DNA within the nucleus.",
