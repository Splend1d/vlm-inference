            "content": " Cepheid stars are relevant for astronomers because they are used to measure galactic distances. These stars pulsate at regular intervals, and their pulsation rate is directly related to their luminosity. By measuring the period of a Cepheid star's pulsation, astronomers can determine its luminosity, and then use that information to calculate its distance from Earth using the inverse-square law of light. This makes Cepheid stars valuable tools for measuring the distances to other galaxies, which is important for understanding the scale and structure of the universe.",
