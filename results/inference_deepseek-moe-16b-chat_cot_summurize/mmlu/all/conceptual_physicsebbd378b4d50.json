The pressure at the bottom of a pond is determined by the weight of the water above it, which is directly proportional to the depth of the pond. This is a result of the hydrostatic equation:\n\nPressure = Weight of water above the point\n\nwhere pressure is measured in pascals (Pa) and weight is measured in newtons (N). The weight of the water above the point is directly proportional to the depth of the water, as shown by the equation:\n\nWeight = density of water \u00d7 depth of water \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity\n\nSince the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the pressure at the bottom of a pond is not affected by changes in the other factors mentioned.",
