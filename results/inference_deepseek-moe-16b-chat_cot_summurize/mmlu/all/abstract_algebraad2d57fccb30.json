            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nProof: Let H and K be subgroups of G. If H is a normal subgroup of G, then for any h in H and k in K, we have hk = kh. This shows that HK is closed under the group operation, and since the identity element is in both H and K, HK contains the identity element of G. Therefore, HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nStatement 2: All groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian.\n\nProof: Let G be a group of order p^2, where p is a prime number. Since the order of G is p^2, we have |G| = p^2. By the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G, say P, with order p^2. Since the order of P is p^2, P is a p-group. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Since P is a p-group, it is Abelian, and its Sylow subgroups are also Abelian. Therefore, G is an Abelian group.\n\nSince we have shown that both statements are true, the answer is A. True, True.",
