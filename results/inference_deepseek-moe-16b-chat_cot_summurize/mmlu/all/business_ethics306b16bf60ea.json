A transparent company will disclose all relevant information to its stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, and the public.\n2. Clarity: This criterion refers to the readability and understandability of the information provided by the company. A transparent company will present its information in a clear and concise manner, avoiding technical jargon and complex language that may be difficult for stakeholders to understand.\n3. Accuracy: This criterion refers to the reliability and correctness of the information provided by the company. A transparent company will ensure that its information is accurate and up-to-date, avoiding any errors or omissions that may mislead stakeholders.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
