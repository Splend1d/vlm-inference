This is because consumers may lack the necessary information, knowledge, or resources to make a decision that is in their best interest. Factors such as lack of education, limited access to information, and economic constraints can all contribute to consumer vulnerability. It is important for businesses to be aware of this and take steps to ensure that their products are accessible and understandable to all consumers, and that they provide accurate and reliable information to help consumers make informed decisions.",
