The dye molecule absorbs light at a specific wavelength, and when it is excited, it emits light at the same wavelength. This makes dye lasers very useful for spectroscopy, as they can be tuned to emit light at specific wavelengths, allowing for the identification and measurement of chemical compounds.\n\nDye lasers are also tunable, meaning that the wavelength of the emitted light can be adjusted by changing the concentration of the dye or the temperature of the laser. This makes them very versatile and useful for a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and materials science.\n\nIn contrast, helium-neon lasers, excimer lasers, and ruby lasers are all specific types of lasers that emit light at specific wavelengths, but they are not as versatile as dye lasers for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths.",
