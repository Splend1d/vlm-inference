            "content": " The best explanation for the effect of low external pH on mitochondria is that it increases the concentration of OH- in the mitochondria matrix. This is because the low pH causes the mitochondria to release H+ ions into the matrix, increasing the concentration of OH- ions. This process is known as acidosis, and it can have various effects on the mitochondria, including the production of ATP through the process of oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix. This is not correct because the low pH causes the mitochondria to release H+ ions into the matrix, not increase the concentration of OH- ions.\n\nC. It increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix. This is not correct because the low pH causes the mitochondria to release H+ ions into the matrix, not increase the concentration of acids.\n\nD. It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix. This is not correct because the low pH causes the mitochondria to release H+ ions into the matrix, not increase the diffusion of H+ ions.",
