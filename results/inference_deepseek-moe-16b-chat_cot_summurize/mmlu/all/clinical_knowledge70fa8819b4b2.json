            "content": " The correct answer is A. can be carried out by the patient.\n\nExplanation: The adhesive strips used to hold dressings in place are designed to be removed by the patient. They are usually made of a soft, conformable material that can be easily peeled off the skin without causing discomfort or irritation. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for removing the strips, as some may require the use of water or an adhesive remover.\n\nB. is not necessarily true. While it is important to maintain good hygiene when removing adhesive strips, it is not necessary to undertake the removal under aseptic conditions. However, it is important to ensure that the area around the strip is clean and free from dirt and bacteria to prevent infection.\n\nC. is not true. While it may be necessary for a healthcare professional to remove adhesive strips in certain situations, such as when they are used to hold dressings in place on a patient, it is not a specialist skill. Anyone can remove adhesive strips if they follow the manufacturer's instructions and maintain good hygiene.\n\nD. is not true. Adhesive strips can be removed as soon as they have served their purpose, which is usually around 72 hours. However, it is important to check with a healthcare professional before removing the strips, as some may need to be left in place for longer.",
