This is because the instance link connects the object to its class, and the subclass link connects the class to its superclass. The instance link helps locate the specific method within the object, while the subclass link helps locate the superclass from which the object inherits the method. Therefore, the correct answer is B. one or more instance links and then one or more subclass links.",
