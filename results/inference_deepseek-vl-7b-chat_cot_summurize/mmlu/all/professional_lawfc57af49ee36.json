The written six-month exclusive- right-to-sell listing agreement provided for the payment of a commission if the home sold. In accordance with the listing agreement, the broker promptly took reasonable steps to market the home, incurring expenses for her efforts. Five months into the listing period, without involving the broker, the homeowner accepted an offer to purchase from his cousin. The broker learned of the contract only when the sale of the home to the cousin closed, one month after the listing period had expired. Is the broker entitled to any payment?\n\nA. No, because the broker engaged in no negotiations with the cousin.\nB. No, because the closing occurred after the listing period had expired.\nC. Yes, but only reimbursement for her expenses.\nD. Yes, the full commission, because the homeowner accepted the cousin's offer to purchase during the listing period.\n",

The agreement provided for the payment of a commission if the home sold. The broker took reasonable steps to market the home and incurred expenses for her efforts.\n\nThe contract between the homeowner and the broker is a legally binding agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for the sale of the property. The listing agreement specifically states that the broker is entitled to a commission if the home sells during the listing period.\n\nIn this case, the cousin's offer to purchase the home was accepted by the homeowner five months into the listing period. Since the contract was in place and the home was sold during the listing period, the broker is entitled to the full commission as specified in the listing agreement.\n\nThe fact that the closing occurred after the listing period had expired does not affect the broker's entitlement to the commission, as the contract was in place and the home was sold during the listing period. The broker's involvement in the negotiations with the cousin is not relevant, as the contract was already in place and the home was sold during the listing period.\n\nTherefore, the broker is entitled to the full commission, as the homeowner accepted the cousin's offer to purchase during the listing period.",
