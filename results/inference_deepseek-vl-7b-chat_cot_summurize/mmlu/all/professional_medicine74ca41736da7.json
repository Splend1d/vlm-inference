She says that she is more fatigued than she was at 65, but she still gardens and drives to the grocery store. Routine laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 25.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/mcL (reference range 4.5-11.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/mcL) and 97%\u00a0mature-appearing lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the lymphocytes to be of\u00a0B-cell\u00a0origin. The most likely diagnosis is\n\nA. acute lymphocytic leukemia\nB. acute myelogenous leukemia\nC. chronic lymphocytic leukemia\nD. chronic myelogenous leukemia\n",
