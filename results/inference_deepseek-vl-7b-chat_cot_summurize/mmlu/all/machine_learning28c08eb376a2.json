H -> U: This indicates that the variable U is dependent on H.\n2. P <- W: This indicates that the variable P is dependent on W.\n\nNow, let's analyze the dependencies:\n\n1. If we know the value of H, we can determine the value of U. This means that U is dependent on H, but not independent of it. So, we need to know the value of H to determine U.\n\n2. If we know the value of W, we can determine the value of P. This means that P is dependent on W, but not independent of it. So, we need to know the value of W to determine P.\n\nSince we need to know the values of both H and W to determine the values of U and P, respectively, we need a total of 2 independent parameters (H and W) to fully specify the Bayesian network.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2",
