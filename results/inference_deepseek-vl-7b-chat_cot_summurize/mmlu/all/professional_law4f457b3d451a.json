The interrogatories stated that they were to be answered within 30 days after service. The defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on which of the following grounds?\n\nA. Interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions.\nB. Interrogatories may not be served until an answer to the complaint is filed.\nC. Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\nD. The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n",

            "content": "A protective order is a court order that limits or restricts the scope of discovery in a lawsuit. The defendant in this case is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on the ground that the interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nIn federal court, the rules of civil procedure allow for the use of interrogatories to gather information from the opposing party. However, there are limits on the number of interrogatories that can be served without the court's permission or an agreement between the parties. If the number of interrogatories served exceeds these limits, the defendant may be able to obtain a protective order to limit the scope of discovery.\n\nThe other options do not provide a basis for obtaining a protective order. Option A is incorrect because interrogatories can be used to discover both facts and contentions. Option B is incorrect because the defendant does not need to wait for an answer to the complaint before serving interrogatories. Option C is incorrect because the parties do not need to confer to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan before serving interrogatories.\n\nTherefore, the defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on the ground that the interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
