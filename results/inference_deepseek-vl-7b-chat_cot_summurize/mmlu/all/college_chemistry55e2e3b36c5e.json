The equations are:\n\nT1 = 2\u03c0/\u03c9_0\nT2 = 2\u03c0/\u03c9_0\n\nwhere T1 and T2 are the rotational correlation times, and \u03c9_0 is the Larmor frequency.\n\nFirst, let's find the Larmor frequency (\u03c9_0) using the given rotational correlation time (T1):\n\n\u03c9_0 = 1/(2\u03c0T1)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given value of T1 (1 ns) to find the Larmor frequency:\n\n\u03c9_0 = 1/(2\u03c0(1 ns)) = 1/(2\u03c0 * 1 * 10^(-9)) = 1/(2\u03c0 * 10^(-7)) \u2248 4.14 * 10^(-7) Hz\n\nNow, we can use the Larmor frequency to find the magnetic field (B) using the equation:\n\nB = 4\u03c0*\u03c9_0\n\nPlugging in the Larmor frequency we found:\n\nB = 4\u03c0 * (4.14 * 10^(-7) Hz) \u2248 1.25 * 10^(-3) T\n\nNow, we can compare this magnetic field to the given options:\n\nA. 3.74 T\nB. 5.19 T\nC. 6.08 T\nD. 9.49 T\n\nThe calculated magnetic field (1.25 * 10^(-3) T) is closest to option B (5.19 T). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. 5.19 T",
