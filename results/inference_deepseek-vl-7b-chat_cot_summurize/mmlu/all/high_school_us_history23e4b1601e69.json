Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nThe political ideas expressed by Ferraro in the passage above most directly reflect those of which of the following?\n\nA.

            "content": "The passage by Geraldine Ferraro discusses issues such as fairness in taxation, the role of women, and the vision for a better future. It reflects a progressive and inclusive political stance, advocating for equal opportunities and fair treatment for all citizens, regardless of gender or economic status.\n\nOption A, Colonial opponents of British taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, is not directly reflected in the passage. While they also fought for fair taxation, their focus was on colonial rights rather than the broader vision of a better future for all.\n\nOption B, Abolitionists of the antebellum period, also does not align with the passage. While they fought for the end of slavery, their focus was on racial equality rather than the broader vision of a better future for all.\n\nOption C, Republicans of the 1920s, is not directly reflected in the passage. While they also advocated for a better future, their focus was on economic growth and individualism rather than the broader vision of a better future for all.\n\nOption D, New Dealers of the 1930s, aligns most closely with the passage. The New Deal was a series of policies implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression to provide relief, recovery, and reform. It focused on providing opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their economic status, and was a significant step towards a more inclusive and progressive society.\n\nTherefore, the political ideas expressed by Ferraro in the passage most directly reflect those of the New Dealers of the 1930s.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
