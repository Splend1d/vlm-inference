            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nKc = [HI]^2 / [H_2] * [I_2]\n\nwhere [HI] is the concentration of HI, [H_2] is the concentration of hydrogen gas, and [I_2] is the concentration of iodine vapor.\n\nWe are given that Kc = 21 at a certain temperature. We are also given that 15 grams of HI gas is introduced into a 12.0-L flask. We need to find the molar concentration of iodine vapor.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given values to moles. We can use the molar mass of HI (15.999 g/mol) to convert grams to moles:\n\n15 g * (1 mol / 15.999 g) = 0.902 mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\n21 = (0.902 mol)^2 / [H_2] * [I_2]\n\nWe can solve for [I_2]:\n\n[I_2] = 21 * (0.902 mol)^2 / [H_2]\n\nTo find [H_2], we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\nHI(g) \u2192 H_2(g) + I_2(g)\n\nWe know that 1 mole of HI reacts to produce 1 mole of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of iodine vapor. Therefore, the molar concentration of hydrogen gas is equal to the molar concentration of iodine vapor:\n\n[H_2] = [I_2]\n\nNow, we can plug this into the expression for [I_2]:\n\n[I_2] = 21 * (0.902 mol)^2 / [H_2]\n\nSince [H_2] = [I_2], we can simplify the expression to:\n\n[I_2] = 21 * (0.902 mol)^2\n\nNow, we can plug in the given value for [I_2]:\n\n4.4 \u00d7 10^-3 M = 21 * (0.902 mol)^2\n\nSolving for [I_2]:\n\n[I_2] = (21 * (0.902 mol)^2) / 4.4 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n[I_2] = 0.00687 mol L-1\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
