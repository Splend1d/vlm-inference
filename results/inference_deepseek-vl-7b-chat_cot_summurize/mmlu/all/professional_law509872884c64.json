            "content": "A defendant was being prosecuted on a charge of manslaughter in the first degree for causing the death of a 15-year-old girl on whom he had allegedly performed an abortion in his private clinic. A witness for the defendant testified to the defendant's non-culpability at the grand jury proceeding. The witness was later called as a defense witness at the trial. During his direct examination, defendant's attorney asked him, \"Is it not true that the defendant could not have performed the abortion on the decedent since he was assisting you in another abortion at the time?\" The witness answers in the negative and states that the defendant did, in fact, perform the abortion on the girl. The defendant's attorney then assails the witness's testimony as a recent fabrication, and asks the witness if he had not stated to a grand jury that the defendant was not guilty of performing the abortion, thus causing the death of the girl. The prosecutor objects to this question. The trial judge should rule that this question is\n\nA. objectionable, because the defendant's attorney did not lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness.\nB. objectionable, because a party may not impeach his own witness.\nC. unobjectionable, because a witness's testimony before a grand jury is more reliable because it occurred shortly after the abortion was allegedly performed.\nD. unobjectionable, because a party can impeach his own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n",

            "content": "A. objectionable, because the defendant's attorney did not lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness.\n\nThe defendant's attorney is attempting to impeach the witness by showing that the witness's testimony is inconsistent. However, the attorney did not lay a proper foundation for this impeachment. The attorney did not establish that the witness's testimony before the grand jury was more reliable or that the witness had a motive to lie. Therefore, the question is objectionable because the defendant's attorney did not lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a party can impeach their own witness by showing that the witness's testimony is inconsistent. This is known as \"cross-examination\" and is a common practice in legal proceedings.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the reliability of a witness's testimony before a grand jury is not necessarily more reliable than their testimony at trial. The reliability of a witness's testimony depends on the credibility of the witness and the evidence presented, not when the testimony was given.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a party can impeach their own witness by showing that the witness's testimony is inconsistent, not by showing that the witness made a prior inconsistent statement.",
