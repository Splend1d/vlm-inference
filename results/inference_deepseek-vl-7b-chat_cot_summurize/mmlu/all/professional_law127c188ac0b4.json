            "content": "A well-established paper mill and a logging company signed a written contract in which the mill agreed to buy from the company all the logs the mill would need for one year. The company was unable to keep up with the mill's needs, and its log deliveries fell short by 10% to 15% in each of the four quarters of the year. The mill paid the company on time for all delivered logs. The mill paid an attorney $2,000 for advice concerning its options in enforcing the contract. It paid a broker a reasonable fee of $5,000 to find additional logs to make up for the company's shortfall. The mill also incurred reasonable costs of $25,000 to transport the additional logs to its facility. Despite the mill's efforts to mitigate damages, it sustained $200,000 in losses because of the company's failure to timely deliver enough logs. The mill has sued the company for breach of contract. If the court finds for the mill, how much should it award in damages?\n\nA. $205,000.00\nB. $225,000.00\nC. $230,000.00\nD. $232,000.00\n",

The court will likely award the mill the difference between what the mill paid for the logs it should have received and what it actually received.\n\nThe mill paid the company $2,000 for advice, $5,000 for a broker, and $25,000 for transportation. These costs are not recoverable under the contract, as they are not directly related to the breach of contract. Therefore, the court will only award the mill the difference between what it paid for the logs and what it actually received.\n\nThe mill paid the company $200,000 for the logs it should have received, but only received $180,000 worth of logs. The court will award the mill the difference between these two amounts, which is $200,000 - $180,000 = $20,000.\n\nTherefore, the court should award the mill $205,000.00 in damages.",
