The LCM of Z_5 and Z_9 is Z_45, as 5 and 9 are relatively prime.\n\nNow, let's find the images of the elements in the ring Z_5 x Z_9 under the map \u03c6: Z_5 x Z_9 \u2192 Z_45 defined by \u03c6((a,b)) = (a,b mod 45).\n\nFor (2,3):\n\u03c6((2,3)) = \u03c6(2,3) = (2,3 mod 45) = (2,0)\n\nFor (3,5):\n\u03c6((3,5)) = \u03c6(3,5) = (3,5 mod 45) = (3,0)\n\nNow, we can compute the product of the two images:\n\n(2,0) * (3,0) = (2*3, 0*0) = (6, 0)\n\nSo, the product in the ring Z_5 x Z_9 is (6,0).
