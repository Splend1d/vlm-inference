The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.97 x 10^24 kg.\n\nNext, we need to find the radius of the orbit. The radius of the orbit is given as 300 km.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ng = (6.67 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 5.97 x 10^24 kg / (300 km)^2)\n\ng = (6.67 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 5.97 x 10^24 kg / (90000000 m^2))\n\ng = (6.67 x 10^-11 m^3/kg/s^2 * 5.97 x 10^24 kg / 90000000 m^2)\n\ng = 9.81 m/s^2\n\nSo, the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle is approximately 9.81 m/s^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 8.9 m/s^2",
