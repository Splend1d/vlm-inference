            "content": "To determine how many times the object reverses direction, we need to find the points where the velocity changes direction. We can do this by finding the critical points of the function v(t) = t cos(t) - ln(t + 2).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of v(t) with respect to t:\n\nv'(t) = d/dt (t cos(t) - ln(t + 2))\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nv'(t) = cos(t) - 1/(t + 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting v'(t) equal to zero:\n\ncos(t) - 1/(t + 2) = 0\n\nTo solve for t, we can multiply both sides by (t + 2):\n\ncos(t) = 1\n\nThis equation has two solutions: t = 0 and t = \u03c0. However, since the object is moving along a line, it can only reverse direction at the endpoints of the interval [0, 10]. Therefore, the object reverses direction at t = 0 and t = 10.\n\nSo, the object reverses direction twice.\n\nThe correct answer is C.",
