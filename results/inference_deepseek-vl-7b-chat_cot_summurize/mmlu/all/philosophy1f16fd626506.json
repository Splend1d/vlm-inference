Glaucon, in particular, claims that justice originates from a social agreement. He argues that people come together and form a society to protect their possessions and ensure their safety. In this context, justice is seen as a way to ensure that everyone plays their part in maintaining the social order.\n\nThrasymachus, on the other hand, argues that justice originates from the powerful. He claims that the powerful impose their will on the weak, and that justice is simply a way for the powerful to maintain their position.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. a social agreement.",
