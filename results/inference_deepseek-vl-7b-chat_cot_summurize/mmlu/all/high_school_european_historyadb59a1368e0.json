            "content": "The passage describes a scene where a passerby shouts about a message posted at the district mayor's office, announcing the First Day of Mobilization to be Sunday, August 2 [1914]. The text then mentions that the message was an announcement to a million and a half Frenchmen, and that it was war. The passage also mentions that the person who received the message was dead tired but exhilarated, implying a mix of exhaustion and excitement.\n\nThe passage does not provide any information about the general reaction to mobilization for war in 1914 across Europe, so option B is not supported by the text. The passage also does not provide any information about the general reaction to mobilization for war in 1914 outside of Paris, so option C is not supported by the text.\n\nThe passage does mention that the person who received the message was dead tired but exhilarated, which could be interpreted as a mix of exhaustion and excitement. This could suggest that the reaction to mobilization for war in 1914 in Paris was not entirely negative, as the person was not completely exhausted. However, the passage does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the reaction was entirely enthusiastic.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable inference from the passage is that mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris. So, the correct answer is option D.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{D}$.",
