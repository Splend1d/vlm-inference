            "content": "A. falling wages and prices.\n\nClassical economics, which is based on the works of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, suggests that an economy in a recession can return to full employment through a decrease in wages and prices. This is because lower wages and prices make goods and services more affordable, which can stimulate consumer spending and investment, ultimately leading to an increase in production and employment.\n\nB. rising wages and prices.\n\nThis option contradicts the principles of classical economics. According to this theory, rising wages and prices can lead to a decrease in consumer spending and investment, which can further exacerbate the recession.\n\nC. expansionary monetary policy.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy refers to actions taken by a central bank to increase the money supply and lower interest rates. While this can stimulate economic growth in the short term, it is not a direct solution to returning an economy to full employment.\n\nD. increased government spending.\n\nIncreased government spending can stimulate economic growth by creating jobs and increasing consumer spending. However, it is not a direct solution to returning an economy to full employment. In a recession, the private sector is not in a position to create enough jobs to absorb all the unemployed workers, so government intervention is necessary.",
