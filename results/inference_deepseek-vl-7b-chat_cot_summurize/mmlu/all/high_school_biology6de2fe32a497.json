Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However, regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes the importance of glycolysis?\n\nA. It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.\nB. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\nC. It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation.\nD. It occurs in the cytoplasm.\n",
