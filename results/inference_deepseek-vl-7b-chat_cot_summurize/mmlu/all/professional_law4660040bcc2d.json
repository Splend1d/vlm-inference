One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for\n\nA. Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\nB. Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.\nC. Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n",

Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\n\nIn this case, the court would likely find for Ginny because Doug's dog, Rover, was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries. The fact that Rover was chasing cars and swerving to avoid hitting the dog contributed to Ginny's accident. The strict liability theory holds the owner responsible for any harm caused by their dog, regardless of whether the dog was acting viciously or not. Since Rover was a friendly dog that had never hurt anyone, the court would likely find that Doug, as the owner, is responsible for Ginny's injuries.\n\nB, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the legal principles of strict liability and the cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.",
