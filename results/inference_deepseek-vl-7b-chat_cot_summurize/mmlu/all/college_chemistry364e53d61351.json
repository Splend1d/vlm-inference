            "content": "To estimate the rotational correlation time \u03c4c for a small protein with Mr = 8400, we can use the proportionality between Mr and the molecular volume. Since Mr is proportional to the molecular volume, we can write the relationship as:\n\nMr = k * Vm\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality, and Vm is the molecular volume.\n\nNow, we can use the Stokes equation to relate \u03c4c to Mr:\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kBT\n\nWe are given that \u03c4c = 50 ps for a small molecule with Mr = 100 in water at 298 K. We can use this information to find the value of k:\n\n50 ps = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kBT\n\nSince we are not given the value of \u03b7, we can assume a typical value of \u03b7 = 10^-6 Pa s for water. Then, we can rearrange the equation to find k:\n\nk = 3/\u03c0\u03b7r3 * 50 ps\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between Mr and Vm to find the molecular volume Vm:\n\nVm = k * Mr\n\nWe are given that Mr = 8400, so we can find Vm:\n\nVm = k * 8400\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of k from the previous step into the equation for Vm:\n\nVm = (3/\u03c0\u03b7r3 * 50 ps) * 8400\n\nFinally, we can use the Stokes equation to find \u03c4c for the small protein:\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kBT\n\nSubstituting the values of Vm and \u03b7, we get:\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0(10^-6 Pa s) * (3/\u03c0\u03b7r3 * 50 ps) * 8400 * 298 K\n\n\u03c4c \u2248 4.2 ns\n\nSo, the estimated rotational correlation time \u03c4c for a small protein with Mr = 8400 is approximately 4.2 ns.
