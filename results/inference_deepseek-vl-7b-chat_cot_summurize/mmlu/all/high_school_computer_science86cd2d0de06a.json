            "content": "The correct answer is D. heads_counter = 2.\n\nExplanation:\nThe algorithm is designed to simulate the flipping of a coin 4 times. In each iteration, the coin_flip variable is randomly assigned a value of 0 or 1. If coin_flip has the value 0, it means the coin flip result is heads, so heads_counter is incremented by 1. If coin_flip has the value 1, it means the coin flip result is tails, so f1ip_counter is incremented by 1.\n\nThe algorithm continues to iterate until f1ip_counter equals 4. In the end, heads_counter should be equal to the number of times the coin landed on heads, and f1ip_counter should be equal to the number of times the coin landed on tails.\n\nIn this case, the algorithm is designed to simulate the flipping of a coin 4 times, so f1ip_counter should be equal to 4. Therefore, heads_counter should be equal to the number of times the coin landed on heads, which is 2.\n\nSo, the expression that indicates that the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails is heads_counter = 2.",
