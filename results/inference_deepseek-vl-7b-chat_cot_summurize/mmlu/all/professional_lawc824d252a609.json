            "content": "Following their law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were driving home in an automobile that was owned and operated by the graduate. As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving \"at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. \"The complaint is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nC. admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.\n",

            "content": "The roommate's complaint against the graduate is admissible as a declaration against interest. This is because the roommate's interest in the case is directly affected by his testimony against the rider. He has a motive to testify against the rider in order to protect his own interests in the case.\n\nThe roommate's complaint is not admissible as an admission, a declaration against interest, or under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. The former testimony exception allows for the admission of out-of-court statements made by a party opponent if the statement is offered to rebut the opponent's own prior inconsistent statement. However, the roommate's complaint is not being offered to rebut the rider's own prior inconsistent statement, but rather to support his own testimony.\n\nAdditionally, the complaint is not inadmissible because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise. The roommate's suit against the rider was dismissed as part of a settlement with the graduate, but this does not affect the admissibility of the roommate's testimony against the rider. The roommate's complaint is admissible as a declaration against interest because it is directly related to his own testimony and his own interest in the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The roommate's complaint against the graduate is admissible as a declaration against interest.",
