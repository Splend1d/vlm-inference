            "content": "The passage provided by Hart suggests that the mere certification of something as legally valid does not necessarily mean that it is morally valid or just. He emphasizes that the demands of the official system must ultimately be subjected to a moral scrutiny. This implies that legal positivism, as Hart seems to be describing it, is not unconcerned about the morality of the law. Rather, it acknowledges the need for a moral evaluation of the law, even if it is legally valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. That legal positivism is unconcerned about the morality of the law.\n\nThis is because the passage suggests that Hart's version of legal positivism does not ignore the moral aspect of the law. Instead, it implies that the moral evaluation of the law is an essential part of the legal system.",
