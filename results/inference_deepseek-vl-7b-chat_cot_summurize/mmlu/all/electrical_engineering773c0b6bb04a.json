This is likely because the question is asking for the short-circuit level at the busbar, which is typically a fraction of the total short-circuit level. In this case, the short-circuit level at the busbar would be half of the total short-circuit level:\n\nShort-circuit level at the busbar = 0.5 * 86.36 MVA \u2248 43.18 MVA\n\nNone of the given options match this value.
