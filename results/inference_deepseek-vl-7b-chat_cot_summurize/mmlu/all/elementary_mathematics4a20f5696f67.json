Since one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds, we can calculate the total time by dividing the total cost by the time one quarter operates.\n\nTotal cost = $3.25\nTime per quarter = 60 seconds\n\nNumber of quarters = Total cost / Time per quarter\nNumber of quarters = $3.25 / 60 seconds\nNumber of quarters = 0.0542 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nSince there are 4 quarters in a dollar, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of quarters by the time per quarter.\n\nTotal time = Number of quarters * Time per quarter\nTotal time = 0.0542 * 60 seconds\nTotal time = 3.25 minutes\n\nTherefore, it took Marcus 3.25 minutes to wash his car. The correct answer is D. 32.5 minutes.",
