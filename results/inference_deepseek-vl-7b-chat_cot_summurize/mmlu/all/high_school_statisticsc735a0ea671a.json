If the machine is operating with a standard deviation in delivery equal to 0.3 ounce, what should be the mean setting so that a 12-ounce cup will overflow less than 1% of the time? Assume a normal distribution for ounces delivered.\n\nA. 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces\nB. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces\nC. 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces\nD. 12 + 2.326(0.3) ounces\n",

            "content": "To find the mean setting for the soft drink dispenser, we need to consider the overflow probability. We want the overflow probability to be less than 1%. \n\nThe overflow probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a normal distribution function. The overflow probability is approximately 0.01.\n\nThe standard deviation of the delivery is 0.3 ounces. To find the mean setting, we need to subtract the standard deviation from the desired delivery amount (12 ounces) and then add the standard deviation to the overflow probability.\n\nMean setting = 12 - 0.99(0.3) + 0.3\n\nMean setting = 12 - 0.297 + 0.3\n\nMean setting = 12.003 ounces\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces",
