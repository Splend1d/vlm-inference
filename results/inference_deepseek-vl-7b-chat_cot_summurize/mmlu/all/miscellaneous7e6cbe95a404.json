In the context of a staffing strategy, a human resources manager might use a hidden market to find potential candidates who are not actively seeking new job opportunities but could be interested in a position if approached directly.\n\nOption A, posting the job opening to a social media Web site, is not necessarily a hidden market strategy. While social media can be a source of passive candidates, it is not inherently a hidden market strategy.\n\nOption B, advertising the job opening on job posting Web sites, is also not a hidden market strategy. Job posting sites are explicitly designed to attract job seekers, not to discover hidden market candidates.\n\nOption D, participating in a career fair at a local community college, is also not a hidden market strategy. Career fairs are explicitly designed to attract job seekers, not to discover hidden market candidates.\n\nOption C, receiving a recommendation from a current employee, is a hidden market strategy. A current employee may know someone who is not actively looking for a new job but would be a good fit for the open position. By receiving a recommendation from a current employee, the human resources manager is tapping into a hidden market of potential candidates.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C. Receiving a recommendation from a current employee.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
