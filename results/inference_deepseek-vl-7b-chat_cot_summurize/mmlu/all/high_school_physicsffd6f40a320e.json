The cross-sectional area of a pipe is proportional to the square of its diameter. Therefore, if the diameter of the pipe is tripled, the cross-sectional area is increased by a factor of 9, and the flow speed is increased by a factor of 9 as well.\n\nGiven that the flow speed is 18 m/s when the diameter is 2 cm, and the diameter is tripled to 3 cm, the flow speed at the second point should be:\n\n18 m/s * 9 = 162 m/s\n\nHowever, this is not a valid option. The problem may have an error or the given information may not be sufficient to determine the flow speed at the second point.",
