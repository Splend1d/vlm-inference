And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nThe encomienda system, which is described in the text and was used during the colonization of the Americas to regulate the indigenous people, was NOT ended by which of the following?\n\nA.

            "content": "The encomienda system was a system of land grants given to Spanish conquistadores and settlers in the Americas, which allowed them to exploit the labor of indigenous people. The system was not ended by the protests of the Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor, as the text does not mention any specific action taken by the Catholic missionaries to end the encomienda system. The lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores (option B) could have been a factor in the eventual decline of the encomienda system, but it is not explicitly stated in the text. The Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly (option C) could have also been a factor, but again, it is not explicitly stated in the text.\n\nThe increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas (option D), was a significant factor in the end of the encomienda system. The text mentions that Cort\u00e9s made a rule that anyone who refused to comply with the rule of returning one third of the gold they had obtained on the night of their retreat should have the whole taken from him. This suggests that there was a significant number of mestizos who were not allowed to work on the encomiendas, which could have contributed to the decline of the encomienda system.\n\nTherefore, the encomienda system was NOT ended by the protests of the Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor, the lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores, or the Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly. It was ended by an increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
