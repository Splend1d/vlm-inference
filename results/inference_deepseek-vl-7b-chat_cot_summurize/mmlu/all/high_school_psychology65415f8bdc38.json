            "content": "The availability heuristic is the cognitive bias that people use to estimate the probability of events by the ease with which they can recall or think of examples that come to mind. This means that people tend to overestimate the likelihood of events that they can easily recall or think of, and underestimate the likelihood of events that are harder to recall or think of.\n\nIn the context of air travel disasters, nuclear power accidents, and terrorist violence, the availability heuristic would lead people to overestimate the likelihood of these events happening because they can easily recall or think of examples of such events happening in the past. For example, they might recall the 9/11 attacks, the Fukushima nuclear disaster, or the recent terrorist attacks in Europe.\n\nOn the other hand, the framing effect (option B) refers to the phenomenon where people's decisions and evaluations are influenced by the way information is presented to them. The framing effect does not directly contribute to people's exaggerated perceptions of the likelihood of these events.\n\nBelief perseverance (option A) refers to the tendency of people to hold onto their beliefs even in the face of new evidence that contradicts them. This does not directly contribute to people's exaggerated perceptions of the likelihood of these events.\n\nOverconfidence (option C) refers to the tendency of people to overestimate their abilities or the likelihood of positive outcomes. While overconfidence can lead people to underestimate the likelihood of negative events, it does not directly contribute to people's exaggerated perceptions of the likelihood of these events.",
