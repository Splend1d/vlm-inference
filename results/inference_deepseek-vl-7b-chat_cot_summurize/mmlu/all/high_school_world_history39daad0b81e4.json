It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following conclusions about imperial treatment of \"barbarian\" (foreign) peoples in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\nB. Empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\nC. Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\nD.

            "content": "The passage provided by Publius Cornelius Tacitus, written around 98 CE, discusses the treatment of the Tencteri, Bructeri, Chamavi, and Angrivarii tribes in the context of the Roman Empire. The text mentions that the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes entered the settlements of the Bructeri, drove them out, and exterminated them. The Roman Empire did not interfere with this event, and even provided a spectacle of the conflict. The author prays for the tribes to retain hatred for each other.\n\nFrom this passage, we can infer that the Roman Empire did not encourage rival tribes to destroy each other to reduce threats to the state. Instead, the Empire did not interfere with the conflict between the tribes, and even provided a spectacle of the conflict. This suggests that the Empire did not welcome migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\n\nThe passage does not provide any information to support the conclusion that the Empire used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state. It also does not mention the Empire using military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that is most directly supported by the passage is that the Empire encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
