If f(z) maps the entire finite complex plane into the real axis, it means that the function takes the real axis and stretches it out to become the entire real axis. This is because the imaginary axis is a line that lies in the fourth quadrant, and the real axis is a line that lies in the first quadrant. Therefore, the function must map the imaginary axis onto the entire real axis in order to map the entire finite complex plane into the real axis.",
