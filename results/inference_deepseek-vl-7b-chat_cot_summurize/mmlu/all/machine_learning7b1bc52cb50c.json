ResNets (Residual Networks) and Transformers are both types of feedforward neural networks. Feedforward neural networks are a type of artificial neural network where connections exist only between the input layer and the output layer, without loops or feedback connections. Both ResNets and Transformers follow this structure.\n\nStatement 2: The original Transformers use self-attention, but the original ResNet does not.\nThis statement is also true. Transformers, particularly the original version of them, use a mechanism called self-attention. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different input elements for a specific output, which is crucial for understanding the context in natural language processing tasks. However, the original ResNets do not use self-attention. ResNets use a different mechanism called residual connections to improve the training process and performance.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which makes the answer A. True, True.",
