            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the following equation:\n\nImpact velocity (v) = Initial velocity (u) - Acceleration due to gravity (g) * Time (t)\n\nWe are given the impact velocity (v = 30 m/s) and the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s^2). We need to find the initial velocity (u) and the time (t).\n\nFirst, let's find the initial velocity (u):\n\nu = v / (1 + g/c^2)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nu = 30 m/s / (1 + 9.81 m/s^2 / (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2)\nu \u2248 30 m/s / (1 + 0.010000000000000006)\nu \u2248 30 m/s / 1.0000000000000006\nu \u2248 29.44 m/s\n\nNow, let's find the time (t):\n\nt = v / g\nt = 30 m/s / 9.81 m/s^2\nt \u2248 3.06 s\n\nFinally, we can find the height of the cliff (h) using the following equation:\n\nh = u * t\nh = 29.44 m/s * 3.06 s\nh \u2248 89.85 m\n\nSince the height must be a whole number, we can round the result to the nearest whole number:\n\nh \u2248 90 m\n\nTherefore, the height of the cliff was approximately 90 meters. The correct answer is C.",
