By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every group of order 159 is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In particular, it is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 159.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\nThis statement is false. The only normal subgroups of a group of order 102 are the trivial group and the whole group itself. There are no nontrivial proper normal subgroups in a group of order 102.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
