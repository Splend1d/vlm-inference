However, we have to be careful not to count each diagonal twice.\n\nFor the first vertex, there are 3 non-adjacent vertices to choose from. Once we choose one, there are 2 non-adjacent vertices left for the second vertex. Finally, there is only 1 non-adjacent vertex left for the third vertex.\n\nSo, the total number of diagonals is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
