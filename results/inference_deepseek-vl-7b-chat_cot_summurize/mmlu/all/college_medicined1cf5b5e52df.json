In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, releasing energy in the form of ATP and reducing the NAD+ to NADH. This process requires oxygen to be present.\n\nB. in the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA.\n\nWhile oxygen is not directly involved in the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA, this process does occur in the citric acid cycle (Krebs' cycle), which is part of cellular respiration. Oxygen is required for the final electron transport chain step, where the energy stored in the NADH and FADH2 is used to generate ATP.\n\nC. in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).\n\nAs mentioned above, oxygen is required for the final electron transport chain step in the citric acid cycle. However, oxygen is not directly involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle itself.\n\nD. in glycogenolysis.\n\nGlycogenolysis is the process by which glycogen is broken down into glucose for immediate use by the body's cells. Oxygen is not directly involved in this process.",
