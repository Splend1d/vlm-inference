This is because uranium-238 has an atomic number of 92, and when it loses two alpha particles (which each have an atomic number of 2), it will have a net gain of 4 neutrons, resulting in the formation of thorium-234.\n\nThe alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons, and when they are emitted from the nucleus of uranium-238, they leave behind a nucleus of beryllium-12 (Be-12), which is made up of two protons and eight neutrons. The uranium-238 nucleus then has 92 protons and 90 neutrons, which is not a stable configuration. To achieve stability, it must undergo a nuclear reaction to transform into thorium-234, which has 90 protons and 144 neutrons, making it a more stable isotope.\n\nSo, when a nucleus of uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, it is transformed into thorium-234.",
