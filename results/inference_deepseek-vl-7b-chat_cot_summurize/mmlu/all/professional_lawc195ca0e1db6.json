            "content": "A group of residents sued a neighboring strip club for creating a nuisance. There are continuous nightly activities by the club, including loud music, unruly customers, throwing cans and bottles,urinating in public, shouting profanities, fist-fighting, and acts of vandalism. The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures. The club defends that it cannot control its customers after they leave the premises, and it reminds the court that it has zoning approval. Its approval, however, is based on a grandfather clause that allows it as a non-conforming use \u0080\u0093 otherwise, the area surrounding the club is strictly residential. Will the court likely issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbor's problems?\n\nA. No, the right of free speech granted to a strip club outweighs the minor and temporary inconvenience of the neighbors.\nB. Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous \u0080\u0093 an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.\nC. No, because there is no remedy for interference with use and enjoyment of land other than a tort action for trespass or to abate an abnormally dangerous condition.\nD. Yes, the activities of the club constitute an attractive nuisance that interferes with the public at large and must be abated.\n",
