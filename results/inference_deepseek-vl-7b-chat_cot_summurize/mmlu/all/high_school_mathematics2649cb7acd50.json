In this case, we have a polynomial of degree $36$, which means that the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial is $x^36$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(g(x))$ has degree $6$, since the highest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ is $x^6$ and the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is $x^3$. When we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$, we get a polynomial of degree $6$.\n\nSimilarly, the polynomial $g(h(x))$ has degree $3$, since the highest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is $x^3$ and the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $x^3$. When we substitute $h(x)$ into $g(x)$, we get a polynomial of degree $3$.\n\nFinally, the polynomial $h(f(x))$ has degree $6$, since the highest power of $x$ in $f(x)$ is $x^6$ and the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is $x^3$. When we substitute $f(x)$ into $h(x)$, we get a polynomial of degree $6$.\n\nSince the sum of these three polynomials is a polynomial of degree $36$, the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$ must be $36 - 6 - 3 = \\boxed{33}$.\nThe answer is: 33",
