            "content": "The meta-analysis by Baltes and his colleagues (1999) indicates that instituting flexitime in an organization is likely to have the greatest beneficial effects on productivity (option D).\n\nFlexitime, also known as flexible working hours, allows employees to choose their working hours within a set range, which can lead to increased productivity. This is because employees have more control over their work schedule, which can lead to better work-life balance and reduced stress levels. When employees are not stressed and have a better work-life balance, they are more likely to be productive and focused on their work.\n\nAbsenteeism (option A) is not directly related to flexitime. While flexitime may help reduce absenteeism by allowing employees to work when they are most productive, it does not directly cause absenteeism to decrease.\n\nSelf-rated performance (option B) is also not directly related to flexitime. While flexitime may allow employees to work at their peak performance, it does not directly cause self-rated performance to increase.\n\nSatisfaction with work schedule (option C) is related to flexitime, but it is not the most significant effect of flexitime. While flexitime may increase satisfaction with work schedule, it does not have a greater beneficial effect on productivity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option D.",
