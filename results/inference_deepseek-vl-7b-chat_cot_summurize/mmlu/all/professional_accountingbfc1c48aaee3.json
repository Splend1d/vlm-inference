Therefore, Becker's capital account balance = $39,000\n\nTotal capital account balance = $39,000 + $39,000 = $78,000\n\nAston's share of AB's ordinary income = $39,000 / $78,000 = 0.5\n\nAston's share of AB's ordinary income = $0.5 * $20,000 = $10,000\n\nTherefore, Aston's share of AB's ordinary income is $10,000, which corresponds to option A.",
