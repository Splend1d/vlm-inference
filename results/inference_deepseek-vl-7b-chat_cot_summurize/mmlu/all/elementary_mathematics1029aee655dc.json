In this case, the diameter of the tree trunk is 8 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is 4 feet. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. Substituting the values, we get C = 2\u03c0(4) = 8\u03c0. Therefore, the equation that could be used to find the distance around the tree trunk is C = 8\u03c0.",
