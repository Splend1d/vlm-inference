Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The \"Know-Nothings,\" lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day\u2026.But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers\u2026..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst\u2014a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\"\nRobert H.

            "content": "The legislative act most closely an example of nativism in the given context is the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. This act was a series of laws passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President George Washington that restricted the rights of aliens (non-citizens) and limited free speech. The act was seen as a response to the growing fear of foreign influence and the perceived threat of a French-led revolution in the United States.\n\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts were particularly aimed at immigrants, particularly those from Ireland and France, and were seen as a means to suppress dissent and control the growing immigrant population. This fits the definition of nativism, which is the belief in the superiority of one's own nation and its culture and the opposition to immigration and cultural change.\n\nThe other options provided are not as closely related to nativism:\n\nA. The Wagner Act of 1935: This act established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and gave workers the right to organize and collectively bargain with their employers. It is not related to nativism as it does not target a specific group of immigrants or their rights.\n\nB. The Espionage Act of 1917: This act was passed during World War I and made it illegal to interfere with the draft, to spread disinformation about the war, or to advocate against the war. It is not related to nativism as it does not target a specific group of immigrants or their rights.\n\nC. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: This act abolished the national origins quota system and replaced it with a system based on the employment of immigrants. It is not related to nativism as it does not target a specific group of immigrants or their rights.\n\nTherefore, the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 are the legislative act most closely an example of nativism in the given context.",
