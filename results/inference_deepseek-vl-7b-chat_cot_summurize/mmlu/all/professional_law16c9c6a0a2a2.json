After losing a large amount of money, the defendants accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, the defendants beat him with their fists and, as the victim fell to the ground, they continued by kicking him in the head. The victim suffered a fractured skull in the beating and died as a result of severe head trauma. Thereafter, the defendants reached into the victim's pocket and stole his wallet. The defendants were arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. Prior to trial, the prosecutor admitted that it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for actually fracturing the victim's skull. If the defendants are prosecuted for felony murder, which of the following would provide their best defense?\n\nA. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement.\nB. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory.\nD. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n",
