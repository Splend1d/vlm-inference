The dead zones result from the rapid growth of photosynthetic phytoplankton (algal blooms) and their subsequent decay by oxygen-depleting microbes in the water column. Which of the following factors most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones?\n\nA. A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months\n",
