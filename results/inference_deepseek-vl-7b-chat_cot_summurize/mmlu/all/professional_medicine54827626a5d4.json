Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased?\n\nA. Pulse pressure\nB. Stroke volume\nC. Systolic blood pressure\nD. Total peripheral resistance\n\nThe correct answer is B. Stroke volume.\n\nDuring exercise, the heart rate increases to pump more blood to the working muscles. This increase in heart rate is due to the increase in stroke volume, which is the product of heart rate and heart rate variability. As the heart rate increases, the stroke volume also increases to meet the increased demand for blood flow to the working muscles.\n\nHowever, during the last minute of exercise, the heart rate has already reached its maximum, and the stroke volume has already increased to its maximum. Therefore, it is unlikely that the stroke volume will continue to increase during the last minute of exercise.\n\nOn the other hand, the other options are more likely to be affected by the increase in heart rate and stroke volume during exercise. Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and it is likely to increase during exercise due to the increase in stroke volume. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is contracting, and it is also likely to increase during exercise due to the increase in stroke volume. Total peripheral resistance is the total resistance to blood flow in the peripheral vessels, and it is likely to increase during exercise due to the increase in heart rate and stroke volume.\n\nTherefore, the most likely option to be decreased during the last minute of exercise is stroke volume.",
