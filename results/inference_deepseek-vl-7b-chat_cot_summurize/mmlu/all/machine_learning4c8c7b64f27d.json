This assumption is made to ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data.\n\nThe second statement is false because the COCO models were not usually pretrained on ImageNet in 2017. In fact, the inception architecture, which was introduced in 2014, was the first to use ImageNet pretraining for object detection tasks. The COCO models, which were introduced in 2017, were pretrained on the COCO dataset itself.",
