In this case, we can compare the boiling points of the compounds provided:\n\nKCl(aq) - Boiling point: 773 K\nFe(NO3)3(aq) - Boiling point: 1000 K\nMgSO4(aq) - Boiling point: 1000 K\nN2H4(aq) - Boiling point: 1000 K\n\nAll compounds have the same boiling point, which means that distillation would not be effective in separating these compounds. However, if we had to choose the compound with the least amount of impurities in the mixture, we could consider the purity of the compounds.\n\nA. KCl(aq) - KCl is a pure compound, but it is not easily separated from other compounds in a mixture.\nB. Fe(NO3)3(aq) - Fe(NO3)3 is a pure compound, but it is not easily separated from other compounds in a mixture.\nC. MgSO4(aq) - MgSO4 is a pure compound, but it is not easily separated from other compounds in a mixture.\nD. N2H4(aq) - N2H4 is a pure compound, but it is not easily separated from other compounds in a mixture.\n\nIn conclusion, distillation would not be effective in separating any of these compounds from the mixture. If purity is a concern, all compounds have the same purity, so it would be difficult to determine which one is \"easiest\" to separate.",
