            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the normal daily allowance for sugar. We know that 12 ounces of soft drink contains 41 grams of sugar, which is 14% of the normal daily allowance.\n\nLet's denote the normal daily allowance for sugar as x grams.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n41 = 0.14 * x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 41 / 0.14\nx \u2248 307.14\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a gram, we can round the value to the nearest whole number.\n\nx \u2248 307\n\nTherefore, the normal daily allowance for sugar is approximately 307 grams.\n\nNow, let's find the number of grams of sugar recommended in the normal diet:\n\n307 grams\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nC. 293",
