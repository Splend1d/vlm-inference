Oval window\u2192 cochlea\u2192 tympanic membrane\u2192 auditory nerve\u2192 auditory canal\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each step:\n\n1. Oval window: The oval window is a small opening in the eardrum (tympanic membrane) that allows sound waves to enter the middle ear.\n\n2. Cochlea: The cochlea is a spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear that contains fluid-filled fluid-filled sacs called saccules. The cochlea is responsible for converting sound waves into electrical signals that can be processed by the brain.\n\n3. Tympanic membrane: The tympanic membrane is a thin, flexible membrane that separates the outer ear (auditory canal) from the middle ear. It vibrates when sound waves hit it, transmitting the sound to the ossicles (three small bones in the middle ear).\n\n4. Auditory nerve: The auditory nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that transmit the electrical signals from the cochlea to the brain.\n\n5. Auditory canal: The auditory canal is the passageway that connects the outer ear to the eardrum.",
