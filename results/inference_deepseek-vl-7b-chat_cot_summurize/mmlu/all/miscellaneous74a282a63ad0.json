            "content": "The maximum power of an old-fashioned steam engine is determined by the amount of coal that can be transferred to the engine. The amount of coal transferred is directly proportional to the work done by the human stokers. The work done by the stokers is the product of their force and the distance they move the coal.\n\nThe force exerted by a human is approximately 100 N (Newtons), and the distance they move the coal is the length of the shovel, which is typically 1-2 meters. Therefore, the maximum power of the engine is the product of the force and the distance, which is 100 N * 1-2 m = 200-400 W.\n\nComparing this to the options given:\n\nA. 6*10^3 W\nB. 6*10^5 W\nC. 6*10^7 W\nD. 6*10^11 W\n\nThe maximum power of an old-fashioned steam engine is closest to option B, which is 6*10^5 W.",
