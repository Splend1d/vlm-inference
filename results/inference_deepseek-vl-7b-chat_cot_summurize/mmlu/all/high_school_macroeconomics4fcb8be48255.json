During a recession, people tend to save more and borrow less, which increases the demand for money. This is because they are uncertain about the future and want to have more cash on hand.\n\nB. a higher price level.\nC. higher interest rates.\nD. expected future inflation.\n\nWhile these factors can also influence the demand for money, they are not the direct cause of an increase in the demand for money. A higher price level (B) can lead to an increase in the demand for money, but it is not the direct cause of an increase in the demand for money. Higher interest rates (C) can also lead to an increase in the demand for money, but it is not the direct cause of an increase in the demand for money. Expected future inflation (D) can lead to an increase in the demand for money, but it is not the direct cause of an increase in the demand for money.",
