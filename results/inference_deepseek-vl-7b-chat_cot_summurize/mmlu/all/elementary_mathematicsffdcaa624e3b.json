This can be represented as 56 \ufffd 8.\n\nHowever, the given options do not have the correct mathematical operation. Option A is incorrect because it uses the division symbol (\ufffd), which is not the correct operation. Option C is incorrect because it uses the addition symbol (+), which is not the correct operation. Option D is incorrect because it uses the division symbol (\ufffd), which is not the correct operation.\n\nOption B is correct because it uses the multiplication symbol (\u00d7), which is the correct operation to find the number of tennis balls in each bucket. So, the correct number sentence is 8 \u00d7 t = 56.",
