It is a horizontal line that represents the minimum average cost of production, as it is the lowest possible average cost that can be achieved.\n\nThe short-run average cost curve (SAC) is a concept in economics that represents the average cost of production in the short run. It is a downward-sloping curve that represents the minimum average cost of production that can be achieved in the short run, as it is the lowest possible average cost that can be achieved with the current technology and production methods.\n\nThe long-run average cost curve is always below the short-run average cost curve because the long-run average cost is the minimum average cost that can be achieved over a long period of time, while the short-run average cost is the minimum average cost that can be achieved in the short run.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The long-run average cost curve is always below the short-run average cost curve.",
