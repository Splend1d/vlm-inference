            "content": "The question presents a situation where the buyer mistakenly typed \"$2,200\" instead of \"$2,000\" in their offer to the seller. The seller accepted the offer without noticing the mistake. The parties are aware of the comparable land prices in the area, which range between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre.\n\nOption A suggests that there is no contract because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term. However, the buyer's mistake does not change the meaning of the offer; it simply indicates that the buyer intended to offer $2,000 per acre, not $2,200. The seller's acceptance of the offer does not change the intention of the buyer.\n\nOption B suggests that there is no enforceable contract because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption. This is not applicable in this situation, as there is no mutual mistake. The seller knew the buyer's intention, and the buyer's mistake was not a basic assumption that both parties relied on.\n\nOption C suggests that there is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended. This is not accurate, as the buyer mistakenly typed \"$2,200\" instead of \"$2,000\".\n\nOption D suggests that there is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention. This is the most accurate answer, as the seller accepted the offer without noticing the mistake, and the parties are aware of the comparable land prices in the area. The buyer's mistake does not change the intention of the offer, and the seller's acceptance of the offer does not change the intention of the buyer.\n\nTherefore, the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between the parties is that there is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
