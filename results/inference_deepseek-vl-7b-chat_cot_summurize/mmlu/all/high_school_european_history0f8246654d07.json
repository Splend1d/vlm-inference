What shall I say of it now, when the words are put into my mouth, my hope of its destruction\u2014what shall I say of its supplanting by Socialism?\nWhat shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization\u2014for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so. The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.\nThis was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.\nWilliam Morris, How I Became a Socialist, 1896\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Morris\n\nA. chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society\nB. chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments\nC. rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion\nD. rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it\n",

            "content": "The passage provides several clues that help us infer the correct answer. \n\nFirstly, the author, William Morris, expresses a deep hatred for modern civilization and a desire for its destruction. He mentions that his hope for its destruction was replaced by the idea of Socialism. This suggests that Morris was initially against modern civilization and its values, which aligns with option A.\n\nSecondly, Morris describes the negative aspects of modern society, such as the waste of mechanical power, the disparity between the poor and the rich, the destruction of art, and the general misery of life. These are all reasons why he would be against modern civilization, further supporting option A.\n\nThirdly, Morris mentions that he was not aware of why he felt this way, but he did not know why it was so. This indicates that his feelings were not based on a deep understanding of the underlying principles of socialism, which rules out option B.\n\nFourthly, Morris mentions that he was not interested in metaphysics, religion, or scientific analysis. This suggests that he was not drawn to socialism because of its philosophical or scientific arguments, which rules out option B.\n\nFinally, Morris expresses a deep love for the Earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind. This suggests that he was not against socialism because he loved the Earth and the life on it, which rules out option D.\n\nBased on these points, the most accurate inference is that Morris chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society, which aligns with option A.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
