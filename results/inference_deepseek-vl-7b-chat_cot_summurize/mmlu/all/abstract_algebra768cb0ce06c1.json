According to the Sylow theorems, if a group has order 4, it must be a p-group, where p is a prime number. In this case, p = 2. The possible structures of a group of order 4 are:\n\n1. Z_4 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_2 x Z_2 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2)\n3. Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 (direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2)\n\nSince there are three possible structures, and each of them is isomorphic to the others, it is guaranteed that at least two of them are isomorphic.\n\nStatement 2: If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n\nThis statement is false. The isomorphism between Z_r + Z_s and Z_m + Z_n does not necessarily imply that r divides m and s divides n. For example, consider the case where r = 2 and s = 3. The subgroups Z_2 + Z_3 and Z_6 + Z_3 are isomorphic, but 2 does not divide 6 and 3 does not divide 6. Therefore, this statement is false.",
