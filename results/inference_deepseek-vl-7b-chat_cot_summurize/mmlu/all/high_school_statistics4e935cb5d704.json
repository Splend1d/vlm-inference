This means that as height increases, weight tends to increase by 0.65 units. \n\nWhen we convert the heights from inches to centimeters, we are simply changing the units of measurement. The correlation between height and weight will remain the same because the relationship between height and weight is a linear one, and the units do not affect the strength of the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0.65",
