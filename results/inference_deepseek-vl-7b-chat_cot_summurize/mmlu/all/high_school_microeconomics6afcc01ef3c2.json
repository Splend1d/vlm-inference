In this case, the demand curve is very steep, and a small change in price can lead to a large change in quantity demanded. This is the opposite of perfectly inelastic demand, where a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. Therefore, when price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, demand is inelastic.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. inelastic.",
