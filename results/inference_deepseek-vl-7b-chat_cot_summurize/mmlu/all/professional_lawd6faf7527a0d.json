On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: \"To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: \"To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman. The husband then dies. The brother then dies.

This is because the woman sold an undivided one-half interest in the land to the husband and wife, and then the husband sold his one-half interest to the cousin. The husband and brother together owned a one-half interest each, so when the cousin received the interest from the husband, she received one-half of the one-half interest, making her own one-half interest.",
