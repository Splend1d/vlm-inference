They were not members of a recognized religious organization; instead, they requested an exemption based on their personal spiritual beliefs against immunization. Will the courts declare the existing exemption to be invalid?\n\nA. Yes, it will be invalidated because it cannot override the state's interest in having its school students immunized.\nB. No, it will not be invalidated \u0080\u0093 it is a fair exemption that the state has chosen to provide for religious groups.\nC. Yes, it will be invalidated because when an exemption is provided it may not unfairly discriminate and favor one type of religion or religious belief over another.\nD. No, it won't be invalidated because it is a valid exercise of the state's right to protect the privacy of its citizens.\n",
