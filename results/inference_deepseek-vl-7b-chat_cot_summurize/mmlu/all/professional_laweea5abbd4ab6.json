Two days after his funeral, the boy's mother saw a television program about gang violence and was shocked to see video of herself weeping over the boy's body. The video had been shot by the television reporting team while the boy's body was still lying on a public street. The mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of seeing the video.

Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.\nD. Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video.\n",
