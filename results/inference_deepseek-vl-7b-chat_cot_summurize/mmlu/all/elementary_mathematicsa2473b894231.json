We want to find out how long it will take her to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nLet's denote the number of minutes she exercises as x.\n\nUsing the formula, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n120 = 50 + (5 * x)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n120 - 50 = 5x\n70 = 5x\nx = 70 / 5\nx = 14\n\nSo, it will take Trish 14 minutes to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 14 minutes.",
