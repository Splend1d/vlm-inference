In abstract algebra, a quotient ring is a ring that is formed by dividing a larger ring by a certain ideal. If the original ring is commutative, then the quotient ring will also be commutative. This is because the quotient ring is formed by dividing by the ideal, which does not change the commutativity of the ring.\n\nStatement 2: An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 in N.\nThis statement is false. In abstract algebra, an ideal N in a ring R is a subset of R that satisfies certain properties, including the fact that it is closed under the ring's operations and that it is a subgroup of the additive group of R. The statement in question is a converse of the more general statement that if 1 is in N, then N is all of R. However, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, consider the ring of integers Z and the ideal generated by 2, which is not all of Z. In this case, 1 is in the ideal, but the ideal is not all of Z.",
