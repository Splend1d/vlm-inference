However, it is not approaching a constant value like 3, e, or sqrt(5). Therefore, the limit of the sequence {x_n} is not a specific value, but rather the set of all possible values that the sequence can take as n approaches infinity.\n\nIn this case, the limit of the sequence {x_n} is not a real number, but rather the set of all possible values that the sequence can take as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNone of the above (A, B, C, or D)",
