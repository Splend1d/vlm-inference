This is the region of the mitochondrion where the majority of the cellular respiration occurs. The Krebs cycle is a series of chemical reactions that convert acetyl-CoA, a product of the previous step in the pathway, into carbon dioxide and a variety of other compounds that can be used for energy production or further metabolic processes. The cycle is named after the German biochemist Hans Krebs, who first described it in 1937.",
