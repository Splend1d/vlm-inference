            "content": "Four men entered into a lease as tenants of a five- bedroom house. They each had a separate bedroom and used the fifth bedroom as a laboratory to manufacture the illegal drug methamphetamine. One of the men was the so-called money man; he provided the funds to make the rental payments and to purchase the laboratory equipment. One of the other men was the chemist; he had both an undergraduate and graduate degree in chemistry and knew the formula and procedure for producing methamphetamine. Another of the men had sold drugs in the past and knew potential buyers of the methamphetamine. Finally, the fourth man was the enforcer; his role in the scheme was to make sure that no unauthorized persons entered onto the premises of the house. The four men had been involved in this drug venture for seven months when they were finally arrested and charged with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, and distribution and manufacture of methamphetamine. During the trial, the prosecution wishes to introduce as evidence against the money man, a statement made by the enforcer to the landlord at the time of the signing of the lease, in which the enforcer said, \"No matter what you charge us for rent, you better O. K. it with the money man, because he's the one who will really be paying it. \" The money man's attorney objects. The judge's ruling on admissibility will depend on\n\nA. whether the enforcer actually paid all of the rent.\nB. whether the enforcer had a legal obligation to pay the rent under the terms of the lease.\nC. whether the landlord may be considered a party opponent.\nD. whether the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking about the admissibility of a statement made by the enforcer to the landlord at the time of the signing of the lease. The money man's attorney objects to the statement being used as evidence against the money man. The judge's ruling on admissibility will depend on whether the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the admissibility of evidence does not depend on whether the enforcer actually paid all of the rent.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the admissibility of evidence does not depend on whether the enforcer had a legal obligation to pay the rent under the terms of the lease.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the landlord is not considered a party opponent in this case. The prosecution is trying to use the statement as evidence against the money man, not the landlord.\n\nOption D is correct because the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The enforcer's statement to the landlord was made as part of the overall scheme to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, and it was made to ensure that the money man was the one paying the rent. Therefore, the statement is admissible as evidence against the money man.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
