            "content": "To determine which gas is most likely, we need to compare the molar volumes of the gases. The molar volume of a gas is a measure of the amount of gas that can pass through a given area under standard conditions (1 atm, 273 K). The faster a gas effuses through a pinhole, the smaller its molar volume.\n\nLet's calculate the molar volumes of the given gases:\n\n1. CO2 (carbon dioxide): Molar volume = 22.4 L/mol\n2. CH4 (methane): Molar volume = 11.1 L/mol\n3. C5H12 (pentane): Molar volume = 10.2 L/mol\n4. C8H18 (octane): Molar volume = 8.8 L/mol\n\nNow, let's compare the molar volumes:\n\n- CO2: 22.4 L/mol < 5.33 * 11.1 L/mol = 59.9 L/mol\n- CH4: 11.1 L/mol < 5.33 * 11.1 L/mol = 59.9 L/mol\n- C5H12: 10.2 L/mol < 5.33 * 10.2 L/mol = 54.6 L/mol\n- C8H18: 8.8 L/mol < 5.33 * 8.8 L/mol = 44.9 L/mol\n\nBased on the molar volumes, the gas with the smallest molar volume is C8H18 (octane), making it the most likely gas to effuse through a pinhole 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas.",
