Measure the \u0394S and the \u0394G for the reaction, and calculate the \u0394H from the Gibbs free energy equation.\nB. Use a bomb calorimeter to measure the heat of the reaction.\nC. Use a solution calorimeter such as a coffee-cup calorimeter to measure the heat.\nD. Use a photoelectron spectrometer to measure the energies of all atoms in the compounds, and use Hess's law to add them.\n",
