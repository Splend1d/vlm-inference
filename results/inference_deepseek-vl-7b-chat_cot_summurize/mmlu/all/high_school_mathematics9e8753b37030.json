            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n\nLet's first find the sum of the first n odd integers. The sum of the first n odd integers can be found using the formula:\n\nSum = n^2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of n for which the sum is 240.\n\n240 = n^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nn = \u221a240 \u2248 15.85\n\nSince n must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 16.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers with a common difference of 2. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nnth term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference\n\nIn this case, the first term is 16, and the common difference is 2.\n\nLet's find the nth term for each sequence:\n\n1st sequence: 16 + (1 - 1) * 2 = 16\n2nd sequence: 16 + (2 - 1) * 2 = 20\n3rd sequence: 16 + (3 - 1) * 2 = 22\n...\n\nWe can see that the nth term of each sequence is 16 + (n - 1) * 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of sequences that sum to 240. We can set up the equation:\n\n16 + (n - 1) * 2 + 16 + (n - 1) * 2 + ... = 240\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2n - 1 = 240\n\n2n = 240 + 1\n\n2n = 241\n\nn = 241 / 2\n\nn = 120.5\n\nSince n must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 121.\n\nHowever, this is not possible because we found n = 16, which is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there is no arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 12",
