We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nProgressive Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" policy in Latin America was best characterized by his\n\nA. repudiation of the Monroe Doctrine\nB. belief that European nations had the right to protect their economic interests in any remaining colonies throughout the region\nC. recognition of the sovereignty of newly independent nations in the Western hemisphere\nD. belief that the United States had an obligation to protect security and stability by assuming a protective role throughout the Western hemisphere\n",

            "content": "The Progressive Party Platform, 1912, which was written by Theodore Roosevelt, emphasizes the importance of the people's sovereignty and the need to protect the Constitution and its purposes. Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" policy in Latin America was characterized by his belief that the United States had an obligation to protect security and stability by assuming a protective role throughout the Western hemisphere. This aligns with option D.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine, which Roosevelt did not repudiate, states that the United States would not interfere with the independence of countries in the Western hemisphere. This is not reflected in option A. Roosevelt's policy did not focus on European nations' economic interests in the region, so option B is not accurate. Lastly, Roosevelt's policy did not necessarily recognize the sovereignty of newly independent nations, but rather focused on protecting the region's stability, so option C is not correct.",
