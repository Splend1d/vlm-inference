We can find the last term of the sequence by adding the common difference to the first term:\n\n50 = 2 + (n - 1) * 2\n50 = 2 + 2n - 2\n50 = 2 + 2n - 2 + 1\n50 = 2 + 2n + 1\n50 = 2(2n + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for n:\n\n50 = 2(2n + 1)\n50 = 4n + 2\n48 = 4n\nn = 48 / 4\nn = 12\n\nSo, the last term of the sequence is 48. To find the number that is not in the sequence, we subtract the last term from the first term:\n\n50 - 48 = 2\n\nTherefore, the number that Lucy would not count is 22.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B.",
