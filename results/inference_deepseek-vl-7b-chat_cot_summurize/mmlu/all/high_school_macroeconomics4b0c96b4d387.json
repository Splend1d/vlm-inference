            "content": "C. Real GDP will remain unchanged.\n\nExplanation: When the government increases spending by $12 million, it is essentially injecting new money into the economy. This increase in spending will lead to an increase in economic activity, as more goods and services will be produced. However, if the government raises tax collections by the same amount, it is effectively offsetting the increase in spending. This means that the overall impact on the economy will be neutral, and the real GDP will remain unchanged.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nA. Real GDP will increase by $6 million: This assumes that the tax increase is larger than the spending increase, which is not the case in this scenario.\nB. Real GDP will decrease by $6 million: This assumes that the spending increase is larger than the tax increase, which is not the case in this scenario.\nD. Real GDP will increase by $12 million: This assumes that the spending increase alone will lead to a $12 million increase in real GDP, which is not necessarily the case. The impact of the spending increase will be offset by the tax increase, resulting in no change in real GDP.",
