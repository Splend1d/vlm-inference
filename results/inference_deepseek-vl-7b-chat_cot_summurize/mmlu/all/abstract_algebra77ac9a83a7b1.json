We can write these elements as polynomials with coefficients in Q and a constant term of 0:\n\nsqrt(2) = a + bsqrt(2)\nsqrt(3) = c + dsqrt(3)\nsqrt(18) = e + fsqrt(3)\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, and f are elements of Q.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that:\n\na + bsqrt(2) = n(sqrt(2))\nc + dsqrt(3) = n(sqrt(3))\ne + fsqrt(3) = n(sqrt(3))\n\nFrom the first equation, we can see that n must be a multiple of 2. From the second equation, n must be a multiple of 3. From the third equation, n must be a multiple of 3.\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 6. Therefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 6.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.",
