Determining whether an equation that is part of a simultaneous system is identified\n\nThe Hausman test is used to determine whether an equation that is part of a simultaneous system is identified. This means that the test is used to see if the reduced form of the equation can be obtained from the structural form of the equation through a suitable transformation. If the test rejects the null hypothesis, it suggests that the equation is not identified and that the reduced form cannot be obtained from the structural form.",
