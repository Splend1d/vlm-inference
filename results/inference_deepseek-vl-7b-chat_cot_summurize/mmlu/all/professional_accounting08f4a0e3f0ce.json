            "content": "To determine the amount Johnson must include in gross income, we need to calculate the value of the group term life insurance.\n\nJohnson's salary is $100,000. The fringe benefit is twice his salary, so the value of the group term life insurance is 2 * $100,000 = $200,000.\n\nThe IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000. To find the cost of insurance for $200,000, we multiply the cost per $1,000 by the value of the insurance:\n\n$2.76 * 200,000 = $552,000\n\nJohnson must include $552,000 in gross income.\n\nSo the correct answer is D. $100,552.",
