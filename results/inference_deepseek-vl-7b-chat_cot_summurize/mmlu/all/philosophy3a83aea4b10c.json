This is because moral judgments are a fundamental aspect of human cognition and decision-making. Without the ability to make moral judgments, a person would be unable to evaluate the morality of their actions, make decisions about what is right and wrong, and navigate complex social situations. Therefore, a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments is irrational because they are lacking a crucial tool for understanding and navigating the world around them.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. is irrational.",
