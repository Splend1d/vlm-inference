If the result is the zero matrix, then the null space is of dimension 1. If the result is not the zero matrix, then the null space is of dimension 0.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of A:\n\nA = [[3, 2, \u22129], [\u22126, \u22124, 18], [12, 8, \u221236]]\n\nA_inv = 1/det(A) * adj(A)\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -6 * -8) - (2 * -6 * 12) + (9 * 8 * 12) = -144 + 144 = 0\n\nadj(A) = [[\u22126, \u22124, 18], [\u22129, \u22128, \u221236], [8, 12, 0]]\n\nA_inv = 1/0 * [[\u22126, \u22124, 18], [\u22129, \u22128, \u221236], [8, 12, 0]] = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the inverse of A is the zero matrix.\n\nNow, let's find the null space by multiplying A_inv by A:\n\nA_inv * A = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] * [[3, 2, \u22129], [\u22126, \u22124, 18], [12, 8, \u221236]] = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n\nThe result is the zero matrix, which means the null space of A is of dimension 1.\n\nSo, the answer is B.",
