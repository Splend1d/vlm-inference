A senior partner in the law firm contacted a professor at the law school seeking information about the graduate's qualifications. The professor replied, \"Don't be misled by that \u0080\u0098A' I gave the graduate in entertainment law. I later found out that he had obtained the grade by cheating. \"The graduate soon received a letter from the law firm notifying him that he was not suitable to become a member in the prestigious tradition of the firm. After the graduate received the rejection letter, he phoned the senior partner to inquire why he was not suitable for employment. The senior partner told him what the professor had said and then stated, \"We do not hire cheaters who are dumb enough to get caught. \"The graduate brings suit against the professor for defamation for falsely charging the graduate with being a cheater. If the professor pleads truth as a defense, he should not be permitted to introduce evidence that shows that\n\nA. the graduate did, in fact, cheat on an examination in the entertainment law class.\nB. another professor told him that the graduate had cheated on an admiralty law final examination.\nC. the findings of the law school indicated that the graduate had submitted a plagiarized paper in a moot court brief.\nD. the reputation among the graduate's fellow classmates was that he frequently cheated on law school examinations.\n",

            "content": "The professor's defense of truth does not necessarily mean that he should be allowed to introduce evidence that directly incriminates the graduate. The defense of truth is a legal defense that allows a defendant to argue that their statement is true, and therefore cannot be defamatory. However, this does not mean that the defendant can use any evidence to support their claim of truth.\n\nIn this case, the professor's defense of truth should not be allowed to introduce evidence that shows that the graduate did, in fact, cheat on an examination in the entertainment law class. This is because the professor's statement was not about the graduate's actions in the entertainment law class, but about his actions in another class (admiralty law). Therefore, the evidence of the graduate's actions in the entertainment law class would not be relevant to the professor's defense of truth.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) are not relevant to the professor's defense of truth. Option B is about another professor's statement, which is not directly related to the professor's statement. Option C is about the graduate's actions in a different class, which is also not directly related to the professor's statement. Option D is about the graduate's reputation among his fellow classmates, which is not directly related to the professor's statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The professor's defense of truth should not be allowed to introduce evidence that shows that the graduate did, in fact, cheat on an examination in the entertainment law class.",
