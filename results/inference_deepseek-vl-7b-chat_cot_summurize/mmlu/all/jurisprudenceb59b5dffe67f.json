This is because Hume's conception of practical reason is based on the idea that moral and legal principles are derived from human experience and social conventions, which aligns with the principles of legal positivism. Legal positivism is the view that law is a product of human institutions and is not derived from natural or divine sources. Therefore, Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason because it aligns with the principles of legal positivism, which he disagrees with.",
