            "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the volume of the cone when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone.\n\nThe volume of the cone is given by the formula V = (\u03c0/3)*r^2*h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.\n\nWhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone, the height of the water is h - 0.5 cm.\n\nThe radius of the cone remains the same, which is 1 cm.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = (\u03c0/3)*(1)^2*(h - 0.5)\n\nV = (\u03c0/3)*(1)*(h - 0.5)\n\nV = (\u03c0/3)*h - (\u03c0/3)*(0.5)\n\nV = (\u03c0/3)*h - (\u03c0/6)\n\nNow, we need to find the rate at which the height of the water changes. This is given by the derivative of the volume with respect to time:\n\ndV/dt = d((\u03c0/3)*h - (\u03c0/6))/dt\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3)*(1/h) - (\u03c0/6)*(1/h)\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/6)*(1/h)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the rate at which the water drips out of the hole:\n\ndV/dt = 3 cm^3/min\n\n(\u03c0/6)*(1/h) = 3 cm^3/min\n\nTo find the rate at which the height of the water changes, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 6 cm^3/min\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the volume formula to find the rate at which the water level changes:\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3)*(1)^2*(6 - 0.5)\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3)*(1)*(6 - 0.5)\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3)*(6 - 0.5)\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3)*5.5\n\ndV/dt \u2248 11.11 cm^3/min\n\nSo, the rate at which the height of the water changes when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone is approximately 11.11 cm/min.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \u22128/(3\u03c0) cm/min",
