We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability of getting a z-score of 0.35 or more, assuming p = 0.3.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of getting a z-score of 0.35 or more when p = 0.3 is approximately 0.0067.\n\nNow, we can calculate the P-value:\n\nP-value = 1 - 0.0067 = 0.9933\n\nSo, the P-value of this test is approximately 0.9933, which is closest to option C.",
