The defendant approached the bank teller, pointed her unloaded pistol at him and said, \"This is a stick-up. . . give me your money and no one will get hurt. \"While the teller was handing the money to the defendant, the victim, a bank patron who was in line, saw the defendant pointing the gun at the teller and fainted. He fell backward and cracked his head on the marble floor. This resulted in a fatal head injury. Moments later, the defendant left the bank with the money. Thereafter, the defendant was arrested. If the defendant is prosecuted for felony murder and acquitted, the most likely reason will be because\n\nA. her gun was unloaded.\nB. there was not a sufficient connection between the victim's death and the robbery.\nC. the defendant didn't intend to harm anyone during the robbery.\nD. this jurisdiction has adopted the Redline limitation to the felony murder rule.\n",
