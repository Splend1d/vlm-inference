The worst-case path length for a network is the maximum, over all pairs of nodes in the network, of the minimum length paths (measured in number of links) between the nodes. For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is\n\nA. 1/(n^2)\nB. 1/(n(n-1))\nC. 1/n\nD. (n-1)/n\n",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to that of the ring network for even n > 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network. Each processor is directly connected to every other processor, so there are n(n-1)/2 links in total. The worst-case path length for the fully interconnected network is 1, since there is always a direct path between any two processors. Therefore, the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network is n(n-1)/2 * 1 = n(n-1).\n\nNext, let's find the figure of merit for the ring network. Each processor is connected to two other processors, so there are n(n-1)/2 links in total. The worst-case path length for the ring network is 2, since each processor can be connected to any other processor in the ring. Therefore, the figure of merit for the ring network is n(n-1)/2 * 2 = n(n-1).\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to that of the ring network:\n\nRatio = (n(n-1)) / (n(n-1)) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1/(n^2).",
