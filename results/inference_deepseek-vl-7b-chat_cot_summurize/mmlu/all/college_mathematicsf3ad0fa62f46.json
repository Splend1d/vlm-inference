If A is a square matrix, then A^2 is also a square matrix with the same dimensions. The diagonal elements of A^2 are the squares of the diagonal elements of A. Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, the trace of A^2 is nonnegative. So, statement I is true.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Consider the matrix A = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]. Then A^2 = A, but the trace of A is 0, which is not nonnegative. So, statement II is not true.\n\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.\nThe trace of a product of matrices is the product of the traces of the individual matrices. So, the trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nSo, statements I and III are true, and the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
