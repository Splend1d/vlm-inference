This means that for a marriage to be valid, both parties must consent willingly and knowingly. Augustine also believed that humans are inherently sinful and prone to error, but he did not hold that we can never err in any circumstances whatsoever.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Augustine did not believe that we can never err in any circumstances. He believed that humans are prone to error, but he also believed that we can make mistakes due to ignorance or temptation.\n\nOption B is partially correct. Augustine did believe that we can err through ignorance, but he also believed that we can err through temptation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Augustine did not believe that we can never err through wickedness. He believed that humans are inherently sinful and prone to wickedness, which can lead to errors.\n\nOption D is partially correct. Augustine did believe that we can err through temptation, but he also believed that we can err through ignorance.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Augustine held that we can never err except through ignorance.",
