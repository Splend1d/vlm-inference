The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\nC.

The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed. This is not necessarily true. The confidence interval is a range within which we can be 95% confident that the true proportion lies. It does not guarantee that the true proportion is within the interval.\n\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record. This is not necessarily true. The confidence interval only tells us about the proportion of students in the sample, not the entire university.\n\nD. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval. This is not necessarily true. The confidence interval is a range within which we can be 95% confident that the sample proportion lies. It does not guarantee that the sample proportion is within the interval.",
