The defendant approached a hit man to solicit his assistance in carrying out the planned murder. Although the wife believed that he was a hit man, he was, in fact, an undercover agent. The wife told the undercovr agent she would pay him $20,000 if he accepted the job and an additional $20,000 after the killing was completed. Upon hearing the wife's proposal, the undercover agent told the wife he would kill her husband. However, the undercover agent secretly intended not to go through with the plan, and he merely feigned agreement because he wished to trap the wife. The wife told the undercover agent that she would deliver the first payment the next day. However, before making the initial payment, the wife learned that the hit man was really an undercover agent. Fearful that she might be prosecuted for planning her husband's murder, the wife contacted the police and renounced her participation in the criminal endeavor. The defendant will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty of solicitation.\nB. guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.\nC. guilty of solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder.\nD. not guilty of either solicitation or conspiracy to commit murder.\n",

This constitutes a crime of solicitation, as she is attempting to hire someone to commit a murder.\n\nB. guilty of conspiracy to commit murder is incorrect because the wife did not conspire with the undercover agent to commit murder. She only solicited his assistance, but the undercover agent never agreed to actually carry out the murder.\n\nC. guilty of solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder is incorrect because the wife only committed the crime of solicitation, not both solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nD. not guilty of either solicitation or conspiracy to commit murder is incorrect because the wife did solicit the undercover agent's assistance in a murder, which is a crime of solicitation.",
