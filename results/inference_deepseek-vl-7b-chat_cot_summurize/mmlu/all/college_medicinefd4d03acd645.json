            "content": "The bystander effect is a social psychological phenomenon where individuals are less likely to help someone in need if there are other people present who could potentially help. In this case, the adult male pedestrian notices a young female on the ground, not moving. According to the bystander effect, the presence of other people would change how the pedestrian reacts.\n\nOption A: The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one - This would not change the bystander effect, as the socioeconomic status of the person in need does not affect the likelihood of others helping.\n\nOption B: The presence of another group of people one block up the street - This would change the bystander effect. If there are other people present, the pedestrian may feel more obligated to help, as they are not the only one present to provide assistance.\n\nOption C: The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one - This would not change the bystander effect, as the ethnicity of the person in need does not affect the likelihood of others helping.\n\nOption D: The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl - This would not change the bystander effect, as the presence of one other person does not necessarily mean that the pedestrian will feel more obligated to help.\n\nTherefore, the presence of another group of people one block up the street would change how the pedestrian reacts according to the bystander effect.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
