This means that the $x$-coordinates of the two graphs are the same, but the $y$-coordinates are shifted by $20$ units.\n\nWhen we shift the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ to the right by $a$ units, the $x$-coordinates will be the same as the original graph, but the $y$-coordinates will be shifted by $a$ units.\n\nSince the $y$-coordinates of the two graphs are the same when shifted $20$ units to the right, we can set up the equation:\n\n$f\\left(\\frac x5 + a\\right) = f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$\n\nThis equation means that the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ remains the same when shifted $a$ units to the right.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive $a$ that satisfies this condition is $\\boxed{D}$.\nThe answer is: 20",
