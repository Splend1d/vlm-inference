This act is generally considered to be a kind and helpful gesture, even though it might be considered as intruding into the elderly lady's privacy.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom for self-defense. This act is morally ambiguous, as it could be seen as a necessary precaution to protect students, but it could also be seen as a violation of the sanctity of the classroom and a potential threat to students' safety. However, it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
