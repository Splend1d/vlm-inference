Homophobia refers to the fear, dislike, or prejudice against individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). This bias can manifest in various forms, such as discrimination, harassment, and physical violence. Homophobia can be influenced by societal attitudes, religious beliefs, and cultural norms that stigmatize or devalue LGBT individuals.",
