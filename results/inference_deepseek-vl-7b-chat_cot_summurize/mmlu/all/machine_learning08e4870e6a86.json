It is actually 1, as the error rate is defined as the fraction of points that are misclassified.\n\nStatement 2: As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant.\nThis statement is true. In Bayesian statistics, the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate is the point that maximizes the posterior distribution, given the data. As the number of data points grows to infinity, the posterior distribution becomes very close to the prior distribution. Therefore, the choice of prior becomes less and less relevant, as it is heavily influenced by the data.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
