We can do this by using the definition of molarity (M = moles/L) and the given volume of the solution:\n\nM = n/V\n\nwhere M is the molarity, n is the number of moles, and V is the volume of the solution.\n\n0.0025 mol of the weak acid is dissolved in 0.250 L of water, so:\n\nM = 0.0025/0.250 = 0.001 mol/L\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa - log(0.001/0.0025)\n\npH = pKa - log(0.4)\n\nNow, we can solve for pKa:\n\npKa = pH + log(0.4)\n\npKa = 4.26 + log(0.4)\n\npKa \u2248 4.26 + 0.091\n\npKa \u2248 4.35\n\nThe pKa of the weak acid is approximately 4.35. However, this value is not listed in the given options. This could be due to rounding errors or the use of different units for pH. In this case, it is best to use the closest option:\n\nC. 7.92",
