            "content": "The garbage can model of decision making is based on the assumption of \"Limited knowledge and high risk\" (Option D). This model, also known as the \"garbage can model\" or \"garbage can hypothesis,\" was introduced by James G. March and Johan P. Olsen in their 1977 paper \"Organizational Decision Making.\"\n\nThe garbage can model suggests that organizations are like garbage cans, where ideas, decisions, and innovations are thrown in. The model assumes that organizations are inherently uncertain and risky due to the limited knowledge available to decision-makers. This uncertainty arises from the complex and dynamic nature of the environment in which organizations operate, as well as the inherent limitations of human knowledge and understanding.\n\nIn this model, decision-makers are not expected to have complete and accurate information about all the factors that influence their decisions. Instead, they must rely on the best available information, which may be incomplete, uncertain, and subject to change. This leads to a high level of risk, as decisions are made with the understanding that the outcomes may not be predictable or certain.\n\nThe garbage can model emphasizes the importance of adaptability and flexibility in decision-making processes. It suggests that organizations should be open to new ideas, even if they are not fully understood or supported by existing knowledge. This approach allows organizations to respond to changing circumstances and take advantage of opportunities that may arise from unexpected sources.\n\nIn summary, the garbage can model of decision making is based on the assumption of limited knowledge and high risk, which reflects the inherent uncertainty and complexity of organizational environments. This model encourages organizations to be adaptive and flexible, allowing them to navigate the challenges of decision-making in the face of limited information and potential risks.",
