This is because in a ternary phase diagram, the maximum number of equilibrium phases that can exist for a three-component system is two. These phases are the eutectic and the eutectoid. The eutectic phase is the one in which the three components are in equilibrium, and the eutectoid phase is the one in which two of the components are in equilibrium.",
