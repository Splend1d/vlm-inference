            "content": "Let's assume the number of birds Keiko counted in the afternoon is x.\nAccording to the given information, Keiko counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon, so the number of birds she counted in the morning is x + 34.\nThe total number of birds she counted is 76, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 34) = 76.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 34 = 76.\nSubtracting 34 from both sides, we get 2x = 42.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 21.\nTherefore, Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon.\nThe answer is A.",
