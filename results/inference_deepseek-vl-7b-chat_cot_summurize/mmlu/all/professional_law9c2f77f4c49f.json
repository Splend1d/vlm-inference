The brother's interest is contingent on the son's lifetime, meaning it only comes into effect if the son dies before the brother. This is described as an estate pur autre vie, which means an estate for the duration of the son's life.\n\nB. contingent remainder pur autre vie is incorrect because the brother's interest is not contingent on the son's lifetime, it only comes into effect if the uncle moves to another state.\n\nC. vested remainder pur autre vie is incorrect because the brother's interest is not vested, it only comes into effect if the uncle moves to another state.\n\nD. shifting executory interest pur autre vie is incorrect because the brother's interest is not executory, it only comes into effect if the uncle moves to another state.",
