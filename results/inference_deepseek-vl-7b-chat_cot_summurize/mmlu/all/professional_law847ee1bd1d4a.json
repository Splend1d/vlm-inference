(which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, \"Look at that car upside down. \" The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will\n\nA. recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.\nB. recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\nC. recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\nD. recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.\n",

            "content": "The jurisdiction's comparative negligence statute will be applied to determine the percentage of fault for both parties involved in the accident. In this case, the driver was negligent for not seeing the abandoned vehicle in the highway, and the passenger was negligent for distracting the driver by pointing out the overturned vehicle.\n\nSince the driver was the one who failed to see the abandoned vehicle, he will be found to be more negligent than the passenger. Therefore, the driver will likely recover only a portion of his damages, as he is partially responsible for the accident.\n\nThe most likely result is that the driver will recover only a portion of his damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\n\nSo, the answer is B. recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.",
