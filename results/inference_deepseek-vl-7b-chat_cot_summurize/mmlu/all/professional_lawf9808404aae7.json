The note states: \"The demon compels me to kill my former employer. I thirst for his bloody spirit. \" At trial, the defendant's former girlfriend is called by the prosecution to testify that the handwriting was, in fact, the defendant's. The defendant's attorney objects. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection on the grounds that the former girlfriend's testimony would be inadmissible opinion evidence.\nB. sustain the objection on the grounds that identification of handwriting requires expert testimony.\nC. overrule the objection on the grounds that the former girlfriend qualifies as an authenticating witness.\nD. overrule the objection on the grounds that the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.\n",

            "content": "The defendant's attorney objects to the former girlfriend's testimony on the grounds that it would be inadmissible opinion evidence. This objection is based on the fact that the former girlfriend is not an expert in handwriting analysis and therefore cannot provide an objective and reliable opinion on the authenticity of the handwriting.\n\nThe trial judge should sustain the objection on this ground. Opinions are generally inadmissible in court unless they are based on expert testimony. Since the former girlfriend is not an expert in handwriting analysis, her testimony would be considered an opinion and would not be admissible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Sustain the objection on the grounds that the former girlfriend's testimony would be inadmissible opinion evidence.",
