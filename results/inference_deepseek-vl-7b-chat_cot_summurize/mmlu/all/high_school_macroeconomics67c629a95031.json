            "content": "Let's denote the initial amount of money in the commercial bank as M. The reserve requirement is 20%, so the bank needs to keep 20% of M as reserves, which is 0.20M. The remaining 80% of M is available for lending.\n\nWhen the bank receives a deposit of $1000, it increases its total assets by $1000. Since the bank is a commercial bank, it can create new loans from this deposit. The new loans created will be equal to the amount of the deposit, which is $1000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money created in new loans from all banks after this bank receives a deposit of $1000. Since the reserve requirement is 20%, the bank can lend 80% of the deposit, which is 0.80 * $1000 = $800.\n\nSo, the total amount of money created in new loans from all banks after this bank receives a deposit of $1000 is $800.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $800.",
