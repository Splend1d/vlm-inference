In fact, it often challenges and critiques heteronormativity, which is the idea that heterosexuality is the default and most acceptable sexual orientation.\n\nQueer Theory also does not claim that the sexual categories and discourses we use are based upon true, underlying biological differences (B). Instead, it questions the ways in which society has constructed and enforced these categories and discourses, often with the help of biological essentialism.\n\nWhile Queer Theory does recognize that deviant forms of masculinity can be more threatening to the gender order than deviant forms of femininity (C), this is not a central claim of the theory. Rather, Queer Theory focuses on challenging and subverting the heteronormative gender and sexual order, which often privileges masculinity over femininity.\n\nQueer Theory does argue that all sexualities are pluralistic, fragmented, and frequently reconstructed (D). This is because the theory recognizes that sexual and gender identities are not fixed or static, but rather are constantly evolving and being renegotiated in response to various social, cultural, and political factors.",
