The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C. Calhoun, \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest,\" 1828\nThe language of \"protest\" that Calhoun used in his \"Exposition and Protest\" was similar to the language of which of the following political positions?\n\nA. The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824.\nB. The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\nC. The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\"\nD. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s.\n",

            "content": "The passage provided by John C. Calhoun in his \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" of 1828 is a strong argument against the idea of a strong central government and in favor of state sovereignty. He argues that if the states do not have the right to judge and correct the infractions of their powers, then they are not truly sovereign. He also argues that giving this exclusive right to the General Government is essentially the same as having a consolidated government with unlimited powers, and that it would result in the states losing all their rights.\n\nThe language of \"protest\" that Calhoun used in his \"Exposition and Protest\" is similar to the language of the response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824. Both Calhoun and the supporters of Jackson were arguing against the idea of a strong central government and in favor of state sovereignty. They both believed that the central government was abusing its power and that it was necessary to protest against it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824.",
