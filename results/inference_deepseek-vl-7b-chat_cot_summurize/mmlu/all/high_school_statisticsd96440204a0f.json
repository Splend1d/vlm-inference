I and III only.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe \"R-sq = 98.1%\" indicates that 98.1% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable. This means that there is a strong linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables, which is true in statement I.\n\nHowever, the regression analysis does not provide information about the direction of the relationship (whether it's positive or negative). Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is a strong negative linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables, which is not true in statement II.",
