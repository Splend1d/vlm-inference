However, it is important to note that he did not explicitly state that a happy life is one of both tranquility and excitement. Instead, he believed that a fulfilling life is one that is characterized by a balance between the two.\n\nIn his work \"On Liberty\" (1859), Mill argues that individuals should be free to pursue their own happiness, as long as their actions do not harm others. He suggests that a happy life is one that is characterized by a balance between tranquility and excitement, with the individual being able to find contentment in both.\n\nTranquility, according to Mill, refers to a state of peace and contentment that comes from living a life of purpose and meaning. This can be achieved through intellectual pursuits, such as reading and writing, or through creative endeavors, such as art and music.\n\nExcitement, on the other hand, refers to the stimulation and stimulation that comes from engaging in new and challenging experiences. This can include travel, adventure, and social interaction.\n\nWhile Mill does not explicitly state that a happy life is one of both tranquility and excitement, it is clear that he believes that a balanced approach to these two aspects of life is necessary for a truly fulfilling existence.\n\nIn conclusion, while Mill does not explicitly state that a happy life is one of both tranquility and excitement, it is clear that he believes that a balanced approach to these two aspects of life is necessary for a truly fulfilling existence.",
