The other woman did not know that her partner had a gun in the shopping bag. After the women placed three dresses into the shopping bag, a clerk became suspicious and approached the women. The women tried to leave the store and, as they did, the clerk grabbed the bag, which fell to the floor. When the bag hit the floor, the gun discharged, killing the clerk. Which of the following would be the women's best defense to the charge of felony murder?\n\nA. They committed a larceny by placing the three dresses in the shopping bag.\nB. The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\nD. The killing, was accidental and unintended.\n",

            "content": "The best defense for the women in this situation would be to argue that the killing was accidental and unintended. The women did not intend to kill the clerk when they entered the store with the gun in the shopping bag. They were simply trying to steal the dresses and leave the store without being noticed. The gun discharging was an unintended consequence of the bag falling to the floor.\n\nWhile the women did commit a felony (larceny) by placing the dresses in the shopping bag, this does not necessarily mean they are guilty of felony murder. Felony murder occurs when a killing occurs during the commission of a felony, but the women did not intend for the clerk to be killed. Therefore, their best defense would be to argue that the killing was accidental and unintended.\n\nOption B is not relevant in this case, as the jurisdiction does not require the killing to be independent of the felony. Option C is also not relevant, as the agency theory of felony murder does not apply in this situation. Option A is not a valid defense, as the women did not commit a larceny by placing the dresses in the shopping bag.\n\nTherefore, the best defense for the women would be to argue that the killing was accidental and unintended.",
