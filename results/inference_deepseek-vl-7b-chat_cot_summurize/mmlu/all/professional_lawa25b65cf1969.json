The statute will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to\n\nA. the rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.\nB. the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\nC. the rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\nD. the rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n",

            "content": "The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. \n\nOption A: The rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business. This option does not involve a landlord and tenant relationship, so the statute would not be applicable.\n\nOption B: The rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six. This option involves a landlord and tenant relationship, and the statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords. Therefore, the statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to this situation.\n\nOption C: The rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant. This option involves a landlord and tenant relationship, but the statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords, not real estate companies. Therefore, the statute would not be as clearly constitutional as applied to this situation.\n\nOption D: The rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord. This option does not involve a landlord and tenant relationship, so the statute would not be applicable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
