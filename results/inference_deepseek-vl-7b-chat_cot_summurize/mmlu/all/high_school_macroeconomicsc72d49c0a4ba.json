In this case, the amount of deposits is $1000, and the excess reserves have increased by $700.\n\nThe reserve ratio can be calculated as:\n\nReserve ratio = (Excess reserves / Total deposits) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nReserve ratio = ($700 / $1000) * 100%\n\nReserve ratio = 0.7 * 100%\n\nReserve ratio = 70%\n\nTherefore, the reserve ratio must be 70%.
