            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and the formula for the volume of a sphere.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 3 points on a circle. This can be done using combinations, which is denoted as C(n, k) and represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to order. In this case, we want to choose 3 points from a circle, so the total number of ways is C(3, 3) = 1.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to choose 3 points such that the pairwise distances between them are all less than the radius of the circle. This can be done by considering the 3 points as a single entity and then choosing the position of this entity on the circle. There are 2 possible positions for the entity (before or after the radius), and for each position, there are 2 possible orientations (clockwise or counterclockwise). Therefore, there are 2 * 2 = 4 ways to choose the 3 points such that the pairwise distances are all less than the radius.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. The radius of the circle is 1, so the volume of the sphere is (4/3)\u03c0(1^3) = (4/3)\u03c0.\n\nThe probability of choosing 3 points such that the pairwise distances are all less than the radius is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (4) to the total number of possible outcomes (1). Therefore, the probability is 4/1 = 4.\n\nHowever, this answer does not match any of the given options. There may be a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.",
