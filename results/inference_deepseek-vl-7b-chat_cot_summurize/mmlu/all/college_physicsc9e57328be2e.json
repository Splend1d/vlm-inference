The total energy required to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV, and the energy required to remove one electron is the half of that value.\n\nSo, the energy required to remove one electron from helium is:\n\nEnergy (1 electron) = (1/2) * 79.0 eV\nEnergy (1 electron) = 39.5 eV\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 39.5 eV",
