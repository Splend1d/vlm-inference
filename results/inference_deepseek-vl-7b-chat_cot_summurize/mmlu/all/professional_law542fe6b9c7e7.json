As the girl was lying in the street awaiting an ambulance, the driver rushed over to her and said: \"Im terribly sorry. This is the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault. Send me all your hospital bills. I'fl pay for everything. \"When the girl was later released from the hospital, her parents contacted the driver who refused to pay anything. The driver told the girl's mother, \"Since your daughter ran into the street, it was her fault. I have witnesses who saw what she did. If I weren't such a nice guy, I'd sue you for the damage to my new car. \"If the girl's parents, on her behalf, sue the driver in tort, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the driver's post-accident statements?\n\nA.

            "content": "The driver's post-accident statements regarding his operation of the car and his statement concerning payment of the hospital bills are both admissible on the issue of negligence. \n\nThe driver's statement regarding his operation of the car is admissible because it is relevant to the issue of negligence. The driver's actions (or inactions) while driving could be considered as contributing factors to the accident. If the driver was negligent in his operation of the car, it could be argued that his negligence was a cause of the accident.\n\nThe driver's statement concerning payment of the hospital bills is also admissible. The driver's offer to pay for the girl's hospital bills is relevant to the issue of negligence. If the driver was negligent in his operation of the car, it could be argued that his negligence was a cause of the accident. Therefore, his offer to pay for the girl's hospital bills could be considered as an admission of guilt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The driver's statement regarding his operation of the car, as well as his statement concerning payment of the hospital bills, are both admissible on the issue of negligence.",
