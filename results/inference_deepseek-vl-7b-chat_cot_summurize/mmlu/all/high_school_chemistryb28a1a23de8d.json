LiOH(aq) - Lithium hydroxide is a strong base, and it would react with MgCl2 to form Mg(OH)2 and LiCl. This would not make the MgCl2 more soluble.\n\nB. CBr4(aq) - Carbon tetrachloride is a non-polar solvent. It would not dissolve MgCl2, as it is not a polar solvent.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq) - Magnesium nitrate is a salt that is not soluble in water. It would not dissolve MgCl2.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq) - Aluminum chloride is a strong base. It would react with MgCl2 to form MgCl2, Al(OH)3, and HCl. This would not make the MgCl2 more soluble.\n\nTherefore, the most soluble solution would be C. Mg(NO3)2(aq) because it is a salt that is not soluble in water, and it would not dissolve MgCl2.",
