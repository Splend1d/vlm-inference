            "content": "Let's denote the length of the ladder as L, the distance between the bottom end and the wall as x, and the distance between the top end and the ground as y. We are given that the ladder is 9 meters long, so L = 9.\n\nAt the moment when the top end is 3 meters above the ground, the distance between the bottom end and the wall is x = 6 meters (since the bottom end is moving away from the wall at a rate of 2 meters per second).\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between x, y, and L:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = L^2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n6^2 + y^2 = 9^2\n36 + y^2 = 81\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny^2 = 81 - 36\ny^2 = 45\ny = sqrt(45)\n\nNow, we need to find the rate at which the top end is sliding downward. This is the negative derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = -dy/dx\n\nWe can use the chain rule to find the derivative:\n\ndy/dx = -dy/dx * (dy/dx)\n\nSince we are looking for the rate at which the top end is sliding downward, we want to find the negative of the derivative:\n\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we found earlier:\n\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -(-dy/dx * (dy/dx))\ndy/dx = -",
