The discovery of viruses predates the discovery of bacteria by several decades.\n\nC. Yes, viruses can be grown in animals in the laboratory. They are studied extensively in laboratories for various purposes, including understanding their biology, developing vaccines, and researching the mechanisms of disease.\n\nD. Viruses are not the cause of all human disease. While they are a significant cause of many diseases, other factors such as bacteria, parasites, and environmental factors also contribute to human disease.",
