By definition, a homomorphic image of a group G is a group that is formed by applying a homomorphism to G. Since a homomorphism preserves the group structure, it follows that every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\nThis statement is false. While it is true that the homomorphic images of G are isomorphic to factor groups of G, they are not necessarily the same up to isomorphism. This is because the isomorphism between the homomorphic image and the factor group is determined by the specific homomorphism, and different homomorphisms can produce different factor groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
