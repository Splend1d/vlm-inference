Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

Mali was able to forge advanced bronze tools from its mineral resources.\nB. International trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources.\nC. The jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit.\nD. Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth.\n",
