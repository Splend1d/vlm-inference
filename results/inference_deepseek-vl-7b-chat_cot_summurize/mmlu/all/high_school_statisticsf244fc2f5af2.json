Since we don't have the exact number, we can use the mean and standard deviation to find the z-score for a value slightly above the given number. Let's assume X = 612.6.\n\nz = (612.6 - 600) / 15\nz = 12.6 / 15\nz \u2248 0.84\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability that the z-score is less than 0.84. The probability for a z-score of 0.84 is approximately 0.1963.\n\nSince the probability of a value being above a certain number is the complement of the probability of it being below that number, we can find the probability that a value selected at random from the normal distribution with mean 600 and standard deviation 15 will be above 612.6 by subtracting the probability of it being below 612.6 from 1:\n\nP(X > 612.6) = 1 - P(X < 612.6)\nP(X > 612.6) = 1 - 0.1963\nP(X > 612.6) \u2248 0.8037\n\nSo, the probability that a value selected at random from a normal distribution with mean 600 and standard deviation 15 will be above 612.6 is approximately 0.8037, which corresponds to option D.",
