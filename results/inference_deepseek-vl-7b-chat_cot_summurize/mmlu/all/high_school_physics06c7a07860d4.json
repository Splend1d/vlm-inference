            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of energy principle. The proton's kinetic energy is conserved, so we can write the initial kinetic energy as:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere m is the proton's mass and v is its initial speed.\n\nThe proton's initial speed is given as 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, so we can write:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m * (1.5 \u00d7 10^6)^2\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of energy principle to find the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field:\n\nKE_final = KE_initial + (1/2) * m * (v_final)^2\n\nwhere KE_final is the proton's final kinetic energy, m is the proton's mass, and v_final is the proton's final speed.\n\nWe are given the initial magnetic field B = 1.0 T and the initial angle \u03b8 = 30\u00b0. We can use the formula for the magnetic force on a charged particle in a constant magnetic field:\n\nF_mag = -q * v * B\n\nwhere q is the proton's charge and v is its speed.\n\nThe magnetic force acts perpendicular to the proton's velocity vector, so we can write:\n\nv_final = v - F_mag / m\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values and solve for v_final:\n\nv_final = (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) - (F_mag / m)\n\nTo find F_mag, we can use the formula for the magnetic force:\n\nF_mag = -q * v * B\n\nwhere q is the proton's charge and B is the magnetic field.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nF_mag = -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) * 1.0 T\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation for v_final:\n\nv_final = (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) - (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s) * 1.0 T / m)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nv_final = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s - 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * 1.0 T\n\nv_final = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s - 0.00024 C * 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * 1.0 T\n\nv_final = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s - 0.00036 T * 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nv_final = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s - 0.00054 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nv_final = 1.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s\n\nSo, the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field is approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s",
