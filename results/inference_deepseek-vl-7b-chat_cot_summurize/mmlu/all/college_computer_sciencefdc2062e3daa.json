Both of these problems are NP-hard, meaning that there is no known algorithm that can solve them in polynomial time for all instances.\n\nHowever, for specific types of graphs, such as trees or planar graphs, it is known that the SPP and LPP can be solved in polynomial time. For example, in a tree, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique, and can be found in polynomial time. In a planar graph, the LPP can also be solved in polynomial time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. P_1 can be solved in polynomial time but P_2 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.",
