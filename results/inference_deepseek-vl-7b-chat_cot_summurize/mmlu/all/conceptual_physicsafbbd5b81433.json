When you scale an object up, the surface area increases by the same factor as the linear size, and the volume increases by the cube of the linear size. In this case, the linear size is being scaled up by 3, so the surface area increases by 3 and the volume increases by 3^3 = 27.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. 3 and the volume by 27.",
