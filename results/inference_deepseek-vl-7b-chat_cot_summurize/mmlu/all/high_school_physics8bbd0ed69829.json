            "content": "The electric force between two charged objects is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\nF = k * q1 * q2 / r^2\n\nwhere F is the electric force, k is the proportionality constant, q1 and q2 are the charges of the two objects, and r is the distance between them.\n\nGiven that the original electric force (F1) is 50 \u03bcN, the charges of the balls are the same, and the mass of one of the balls is doubled. Let's denote the original mass of the ball as m1 and the new mass as m2.\n\nSince the charge of each ball remains the same, the new electric force (F2) can be calculated as:\n\nF2 = k * q1 * q2 / r^2\n\nWe are not given the value of r, so we cannot directly calculate F2. However, we can use the given information to find the relationship between F1 and F2.\n\nSince the mass of one of the balls is doubled, the new force (F2) will be twice the original force (F1):\n\nF2 = 2 * F1\n\nNow, we can substitute the given value of F1:\n\nF2 = 2 * 50 \u03bcN\nF2 = 100 \u03bcN\n\nSo, the new electric force between the balls is 100 \u03bcN. The correct answer is B.",
