            "content": "A landlord, an owner in fee simple, leased a three- story house to a tenant for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the new owner.\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land. \"\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. the new owner.\n\nThe landlord's covenant to pay taxes on the property was not transferred to the new owner when the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to the new owner. Therefore, the new owner cannot recover the taxes paid from the student. The student's obligation to pay the taxes was not a part of the leasehold interest that he assumed when he assigned the leasehold interest to himself. The student's obligation to pay the taxes was only a part of the tenant's obligation, which was not transferred to the new owner.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property. This is incorrect because the student assumed the leasehold interest, which included the obligation to pay the taxes on the property.\n\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease. This is incorrect because the covenant to pay taxes was not a part of the leasehold interest that the student assumed.\n\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land.\" This is incorrect because the covenant to pay taxes was not a part of the leasehold interest that the student assumed.",
