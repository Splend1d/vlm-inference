            "content": "The number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of $k!$ is determined by the number of factors of 10 in the prime factorization of $k!$. Since 10 is a product of 2 and 5, we need to count the number of factors of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of $k!$.\n\nFor every factor of 2, we have one factor of 10, and for every factor of 5, we have one factor of 10. Therefore, we need to count the number of factors of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of $k!$.\n\nThe number of factors of 2 in the prime factorization of $k!$ is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{2^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{2^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\dotsb$, where $\\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\n\nThe number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $k!$ is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\dotsb$.\n\nTo count the number of factors of 10, we need to count the number of factors of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of $k!$. Since the number of factors of 2 and 5 are independent, we can simply add the number of factors of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of $k!$.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers $k$ for which the ordinary decimal representation of $k!$ ends in exactly 99 zeros is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{99}{10} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{99}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 9 + 19 = \\boxed{28}$.\nThe answer is: 28",
