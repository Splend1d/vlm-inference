            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the average rate of decrease in the number of reported measles cases from 1960 to 1996. We can do this by finding the difference in the number of cases and dividing it by the number of years.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1996, there were 450,000 - 500 = 449,500 cases reported. The number of years between 1960 and 1996 is 1996 - 1960 = 36 years.\n\nNow, we can find the average rate of decrease per year:\n\n(450,000 - 500) / 36 = 449,500 / 36 = 12,483.33\n\nThis means that the number of cases reported decreased by 12,483.33 cases per year on average.\n\nTo find the number of cases reported in 1987, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of cases in 1987 = Number of cases in 1960 - (Average rate of decrease * Number of years from 1960 to 1987)\n\nNumber of cases in 1960 = 450,000\nNumber of years from 1960 to 1987 = 1987 - 1960 = 27 years\n\nNumber of cases in 1987 = 450,000 - (12,483.33 * 27) = 450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875\n\nSo, the number of cases of measles that would have been reported in 1987 if the number of cases reported from 1960 to 1996 decreased linearly is 112,875.
