            "content": "To find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the value and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value we want to standardize (225 in this case), \u03bc is the mean (210), and \u03c3 is the standard deviation (10).\n\nz = (225 - 210) / 10\nz = 15 / 10\nz = 1.5\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can look up the probability in the z-table. The table gives us the probability that a value is less than the z-score. Since we want the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we need to find the probability of a candy bar having 225 calories or less.\n\nLooking up the z-score of 1.5 in the z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.8413. This means that there is a 15.87% chance that a candy bar will have 225 calories or less.\n\nTo find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we subtract this probability from 100%:\n\n100% - 15.87% = 84.13%\n\nSo, approximately 84.13% of candy bars contain more than 225 calories.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 43.30%.",
