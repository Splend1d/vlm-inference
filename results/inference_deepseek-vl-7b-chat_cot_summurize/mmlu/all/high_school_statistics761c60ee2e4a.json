The problem states that:\n\n1. The x-variable values are increased by 0.23, so X' = X + 0.23\n2. The y-variable values are doubled, so Y' = 2Y\n3. The two variables are interchanged, so X' and Y' are swapped.\n\nThe new correlation, r', can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nr' = (X' * Y') / sqrt((X' * X')^2 + (Y' * Y')^2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate X' and Y':\n\nX' = X + 0.23\nY' = 2Y\n\nNow, let's calculate the new correlation:\n\nr' = (X' * Y') / sqrt((X' * X')^2 + (Y' * Y')^2)\nr' = ((X + 0.23) * (2Y)) / sqrt(((X + 0.23) * (X + 0.23))^2 + (2Y * 2Y)^2)\nr' = (2.23X + 0.46) / sqrt((2.23X + 0.46)^2 + (4Y^2))\n\nNow, let's substitute the given correlation r = 0.19:\n\nr' = (2.23X + 0.46) / sqrt((2.23X + 0.46)^2 + (4Y^2))\nr' = (2.23X + 0.46) / sqrt((2.23X + 0.46)^2 + (4 * 0.19^2))\nr' = (2.23X + 0.46) / sqrt((2.23X + 0.46)^2 + 0.841)\n\nNow, let's calculate the new correlation r':\n\nr' = (2.23X + 0.46) / sqrt((2.23X + 0.46)^2 + 0.841)\nr' \u2248 0.42\n\nSo, the new correlation r' is approximately 0.42.
