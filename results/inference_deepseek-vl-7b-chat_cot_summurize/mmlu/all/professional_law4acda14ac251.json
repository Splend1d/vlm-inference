The car swerved out of control, jumped the curb, and crashed into a home. The defendant was arrested and charged with the separate crimes of larceny and malicious destruction of property.

The defendant's attorney has filed a motion objecting to the judge's jury instruction. The judge's instruction was\n\nA. correct, because malice can be inferred from the intent to steal.\nB. correct, because malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime.\nC. incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\nD. incorrect, because malice requires a showing of recklessness.\n",

            "content": "The defendant's attorney has filed a motion objecting to the judge's jury instruction because the judge instructed the jury that the theft of the car was sufficient evidence to satisfy the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. The defendant's attorney argues that larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property, and therefore the judge's instruction is incorrect.\n\nLarceny is a theft offense, while malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime. The defendant's intent to steal the car is not necessarily indicative of the intent to cause malicious destruction of property. The defendant may have intended to steal the car, but the act of crashing into a home was not part of their plan. Therefore, the theft of the car is not sufficient evidence to satisfy the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge.\n\nThe judge's instruction is incorrect because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property. The defendant's attorney's motion is correct in objecting to the judge's jury instruction.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.",
