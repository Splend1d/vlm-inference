This can be written as B:W = 5:3.\n\nWe are given that the company makes 15 white cars in one day. We can use this information to find the number of blue cars.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of white cars in terms of the ratio. Since B:W = 5:3, we can write W = (5/3) * B.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of W into the equation: 15 = (5/3) * B.\n\nTo solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/5: B = 15 * (3/5) = 9.\n\nTherefore, the company will make 9 blue cars.\n\nThe correct answer is A.",
