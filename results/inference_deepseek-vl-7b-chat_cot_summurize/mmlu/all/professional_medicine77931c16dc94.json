The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\nA. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\nB. Epidermal growth factor\nC. Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\nD. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1\n",

            "content": "The most appropriate next step in treatment for a 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis who has been unresponsive to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sulfasalazine treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is an autoimmune disease that involves inflammation of the spine and other joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and potential joint damage. TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the inflammatory process in the body, and its inhibition has been shown to be effective in managing symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nTNF-\u03b1 inhibitors are a class of drugs that block the action of TNF-\u03b1, thereby reducing inflammation and pain. These drugs have been shown to be effective in controlling symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis and slowing down the progression of the disease.\n\nThe other options listed (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, Epidermal growth factor, and Interleukin-1) are not directly related to the inflammatory process in ankylosing spondylitis. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a protein involved in immune regulation, Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor involved in cell growth and differentiation, and Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response. While these factors may play a role in the immune system and inflammation, they are not specific targets for treatment in ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in treatment for this patient would be to administer a drug that inhibits Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).",
