I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J. Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" 1898\nThe sentiment expressed by Beveridge best exemplifies which of the following?\n\nA. Imperialism\nB. Anti-imperialism\nC. Isolationism\nD. Manifest Destiny\n",

            "content": "The sentiment expressed by Albert J. Beveridge in his speech \"The March of the Flag,\" 1898, best exemplifies the sentiment of Manifest Destiny. This is because he argues that the United States has a duty to govern and civilize the peoples it has liberated from oppressive rule, and to provide them with self-rule. This aligns with the belief that the United States had a divine mission to expand its influence and spread its values, which is the essence of Manifest Destiny.\n\nManifest Destiny was a belief that the United States had a moral and religious obligation to expand its territory and influence across the North American continent, and beyond, to fulfill a divine plan. This belief was often associated with the idea that the United States was destined to lead the world in spreading democracy and civilization.\n\nIn the speech, Beveridge argues that the United States has a duty to govern and civilize the peoples it has liberated, and to provide them with self-rule. He compares the United States to a parent, suggesting that it has a responsibility to care for and guide its \"children\" (the peoples it has liberated). This aligns with the idea of Manifest Destiny, which was often associated with the belief that the United States had a moral and religious obligation to expand its influence and spread its values.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment expressed by Beveridge in his speech best exemplifies Manifest Destiny.",
