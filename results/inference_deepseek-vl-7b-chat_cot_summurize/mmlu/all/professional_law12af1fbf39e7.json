The light for the carpenter was green, so the carpenter proceeded to drive through the intersection. A bus entered the intersection from the west and slammed into the carpenter's car. The carpenter was seriously injured in the crash and missed several weeks of work while recovering from the injuries. Which of the following facts or inferences, if true, would be most helpful in an action by the carpenter against the driver of the bus?\n\nA. The bus driver had received three speeding tickets in the past.\nB. The carpenter's car was in good condition, and it had passed a safety inspection just a week before the accident.\nC. The traffic signal at the intersection had been inspected the day before the accident and found to be functioning properly.\nD. The bus driver was operating the bus without a driver's license in violation of the State Motor Vehicle Code.\n",

The bus driver was operating the bus without a driver's license in violation of the State Motor Vehicle Code. This would establish that the bus driver was not legally allowed to be driving the bus, which could potentially strengthen the carpenter's case against the bus driver.",
