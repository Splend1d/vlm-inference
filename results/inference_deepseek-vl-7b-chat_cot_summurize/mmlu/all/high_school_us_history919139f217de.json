Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nIn the passage above Coolidge is reacting against which of the following?\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\nC. Populist agitation in the West\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n",

            "content": "The passage above is a speech by Calvin Coolidge, where he discusses the importance of economic security and the dangers of excessive taxation. He criticizes a government that imposes taxes on the people without a legitimate reason, stating that such a government is not a protector of liberty but an instrument of tyranny. He also emphasizes the importance of the right of the people to their property and the need for reasonable security against unreasonable taxation.\n\nFrom the given options, the speech does not seem to be reacting against the economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding, the growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution, or the governmental policies of the Progressive Era. These options do not align with the main themes of the passage, which focus on the importance of economic security, the dangers of excessive taxation, and the role of the government in protecting the rights of its citizens.\n\nOn the other hand, the passage does seem to be reacting against Populist agitation in the West. The Populists were a group of Americans who advocated for the rights of ordinary people against the influence of big business and the wealthy. They were critical of the economic policies of the time, which they believed favored the rich at the expense of the poor. The passage reflects a similar sentiment, as Coolidge criticizes a government that imposes taxes on the people without a legitimate reason, suggesting that such a government is not protecting the rights of its citizens.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Populist agitation in the West.",
