This is because the A:C ratio is a fundamental feature of the DNA structure and is essential for the accurate replication and repair of DNA. The A:C ratio is approximately 1:1 in most organisms, and any deviation from this ratio would likely result in genetic errors or mutations.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) are not directly related to the DNA base composition and do not have a constant ratio in the DNA.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A.
