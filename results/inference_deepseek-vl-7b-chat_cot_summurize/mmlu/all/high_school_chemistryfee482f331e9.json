Last, fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water.\n\nExplanation:\nTo create a 1.00 L solution, you need to dilute the stock solution of 18.0 M H2SO4 to a final concentration of 3.0 M. \n\nFirst, you need to determine the amount of H2SO4 in the stock solution. Since the initial concentration is 18.0 M, and you want to dilute it to 3.0 M, you can use the following formula:\n\nConcentration of final solution = Initial concentration / Dilution factor\nConcentration of final solution = 3.0 M / 1.00 L / 18.0 M\nConcentration of final solution = 3.0 M / 1.00 L / 18.0 M\nConcentration of final solution = 3.0 M / 18.0 M\nConcentration of final solution = 0.0167 M\n\nNow, you need to determine how much H2SO4 is in the stock solution. Since the initial concentration is 18.0 M, and you want to dilute it to 0.0167 M, you can use the following formula:\n\nAmount of H2SO4 in the stock solution = Initial concentration \u00d7 Dilution factor\nAmount of H2SO4 in the stock solution = 18.0 M \u00d7 1.00 L / 0.0167 M\nAmount of H2SO4 in the stock solution = 18.0 M \u00d7 1.00 L / 0.0167 M\nAmount of H2SO4 in the stock solution = 18.0 M \u00d7 60.0 L\nAmount of H2SO4 in the stock solution = 1080.0 M\n\nNow, you can determine how much H2SO4 you need to add to the flask. Since you have 167 mL of the stock solution, and you want to dilute it to 0.0167 M, you can use the following formula:\n\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = Initial concentration \u00d7 Dilution factor\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 18.0 M \u00d7 1.00 L / 0.0167 M\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 18.0 M \u00d7 1.00 L / 0.0167 M\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 18.0 M \u00d7 60.0 L\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 1080.0 M\n\nFinally, you can determine how much H2SO4 you need to add to the flask. Since you have 167 mL of the stock solution, and you want to dilute it to 0.0167 M, you can use the following formula:\n\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = Initial concentration \u00d7 Dilution factor\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 18.0 M \u00d7 1.00 L / 0.0167 M\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 18.0 M \u00d7 1.00 L / 0.0167 M\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 18.0 M \u00d7 60.0 L\nAmount of H2SO4 to add = 1080.0 M\n\nSo, you need to add 167 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution.",
