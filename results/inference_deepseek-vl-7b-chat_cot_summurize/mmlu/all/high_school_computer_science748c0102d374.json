In all cases, a binary search of a sorted list requires fewer comparisons than a linear search.\nB. Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.\nC. A linear search will generally run faster than a binary search because a linear search requires fewer lines of code to implement.\nD. Using a linear search is preferable to using a binary search if there is a chance that the target may not be found in the list.\n",
