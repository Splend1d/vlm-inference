            "content": "To calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the month of January, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the ending inventory for each type of item.\n2. Calculate the cost of goods sold for each type of item.\n3. Add the cost of goods sold for each type of item to find the total COGS.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Ending inventory:\n- Beginning inventory: 20,000 units at $13.50 per unit\n- Purchase 1: 30,000 units at $15 per unit\n- Purchase 2: 40,000 units at $17 per unit\n\nEnding inventory = Beginning inventory + Purchase 1 + Purchase 2\nEnding inventory = 20,000 + 30,000 + 40,000 = 90,000 units\n\n2. Cost of goods sold for each type of item:\n- Purchase 1: 30,000 units at $15 per unit\n- Purchase 2: 40,000 units at $17 per unit\n\nCost of goods sold = Purchase 1 + Purchase 2\nCost of goods sold = 30,000 + 40,000 = 70,000 units\n\n3. Total COGS:\nTotal COGS = Cost of goods sold for each type of item\nTotal COGS = 70,000 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount to be reported as COGS on the income statement:\n\nAmount to be reported as COGS = Total COGS * Selling price per unit\nAmount to be reported as COGS = 70,000 units * $20 per unit\nAmount to be reported as COGS = $1,400,000\n\nThe correct answer is A. $710,000.",
