The forces acting on the ball are the weight (mg) and the upward force due to the upward motion (ma).\n\nAt the 10-m position, the ball has already gained a height of 10 meters. Therefore, the upward force due to the upward motion (ma) is 0. The net force on the ball is the difference between the weight (mg) and the upward force due to the upward motion (ma).\n\nSo, the net force on the ball at the 10-m position is:\n\nNet force = mg - ma\nNet force = mg - 0\nNet force = mg\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. mg.",
