            "content": "A man entered into a franchise contract with a company to operate a fast-food restaurant in a city. The company's national headquarters is located in another state. After the contract was executed, the man leased a store in a shopping center where he planned to open his restaurant. City public officials, however, refused to grant the man the necessary food vendor's license despite the fact that he could prove that his restaurant complied with all provisions of the municipal licensing ordinance. Section 1287 of the city food vending ordinance provides, in part, that \"a food vendor's license shall be issued to any applicant who properly complies with all of the health requirements of this ordinance. \" After the man's application for a food vendor's license was rejected, he requested a hearing to establish his qualifications. City officials refused this request and also declined to give any reason for his license denial. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument that the man may use to challenge the refusal of the city officials to grant him a food vendor's license?\n\nA. The city action denies him procedural due process.\nB. The city action denies him substantive due process by arbitrarily regulating economic activity.\nC. The city action constitutes an undue burden on the potential interstate commerce between the man and his out-of-state franchisor.\nD. The city action impairs the obligation of the man's contract with the franchising company and his rental agreement with the shopping mall.\n",

            "content": "The strongest constitutional argument that the man may use to challenge the refusal of the city officials to grant him a food vendor's license is that the city action impairs the obligation of the man's contract with the franchising company and his rental agreement with the shopping mall. This is because the man's contract with the franchising company and his lease with the shopping mall both require him to operate a fast-food restaurant in the city. If the city does not grant him a food vendor's license, he cannot legally operate a restaurant, which would violate the terms of his contract with the franchising company and his lease with the shopping mall. This would be a direct impairment of these contractual obligations.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the man's contractual obligations. Option A, procedural due process, is not directly relevant because the man's request for a hearing was denied, not because of a lack of procedural fairness. Option B, substantive due process by arbitrarily regulating economic activity, is not directly relevant because the man's application for a food vendor's license was not denied on the basis of arbitrary regulation of economic activity. Option C, an undue burden on potential interstate commerce, is not directly relevant because the man's contract with the franchising company is not related to interstate commerce.",
