This is because a diet high in fiber, which is abundant in plant-based foods, can help prevent colorectal cancer. However, vegetarians are also more likely to have a healthy weight, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, all of which can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.",
