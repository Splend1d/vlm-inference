I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nWhich of the following documents encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?\n\nA.

The Mayflower Compact.\n\nThe Mayflower Compact was a document signed by the passengers of the Mayflower in 1620, establishing a self-governing body for the colony. It did not specifically encourage church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but it laid the foundation for the establishment of civil government and religious authority in the colony.\n\nThe other documents listed (The Fundamental Orders, The Halfway Covenant, and The Cambridge Agreement) were not related to church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Fundamental Orders was a document created by the settlers of Connecticut in 1639, which established a system of government for the colony. The Halfway Covenant was a religious compromise in the Massachusetts Bay Colony that allowed some non-conformist Puritans to remain in the colony, while still maintaining the authority of the established church. The Cambridge Agreement was a document signed by the leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1631, which established a system of government for the colony.",
