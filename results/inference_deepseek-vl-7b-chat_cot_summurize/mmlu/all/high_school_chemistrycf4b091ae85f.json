            "content": "To neutralize completely, we need to find the stoichiometry of the reaction between KOH and H3PO4.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nKOH(aq) + H3PO4(aq) \u2192 KH(aq) + H2PO4^-(aq)\n\nThe molar masses of KOH, H3PO4, KH, and H2PO4^- are 84.1 g/mol, 99.1 g/mol, 39.1 g/mol, and 142.1 g/mol, respectively.\n\nThe molar mass of the products is 123.2 g/mol.\n\nThe moles of KOH needed to neutralize 50.0 mL of H3PO4 can be calculated using the stoichiometry:\n\nmoles of KOH = moles of H3PO4 \u00d7 molar mass of products / molar mass of KOH\nmoles of KOH = 0.150 M \u00d7 50.0 mL \u00d7 99.1 g/mol / 84.1 g/mol\nmoles of KOH = 0.150 M \u00d7 4.99 g/mL\nmoles of KOH = 0.7485 M\n\nSince we have 0.250 M KOH, we can calculate the volume of KOH needed to neutralize 50.0 mL of H3PO4:\n\nvolume of KOH = moles of KOH \u00d7 molar mass of KOH / molar mass of KOH\nvolume of KOH = 0.7485 M \u00d7 84.1 g/mol / 0.250 M\nvolume of KOH = 33.7 mL\n\nTherefore, it takes 33.7 mL of 0.250 M KOH to neutralize completely 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H3PO4.\n\nThe answer is: 30.0 mL",
