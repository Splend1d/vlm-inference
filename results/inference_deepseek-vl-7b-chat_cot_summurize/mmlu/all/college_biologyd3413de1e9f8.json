            "content": "At the maximal rate of the reaction, the following statement is true:\n\nA. Nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\n\nThis is because at the maximum rate, the enzyme is fully saturated with acetaldehyde, meaning that all available enzyme sites are occupied by acetaldehyde molecules. This allows for the maximum rate of the reaction to occur.\n\nB. The activation energy of the reaction decreases.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. Activation energy is a measure of the energy required for a reaction to occur, and it is independent of the concentration of reactants.\n\nC. The change in free energy of the reaction decreases.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. The change in free energy (\u0394G) is a measure of the energy required for a reaction to occur, and it is independent of the concentration of reactants.\n\nD. The enzyme is no longer specific for acetaldehyde.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. The enzyme's specificity for acetaldehyde is determined by its active site, which is specific for acetaldehyde. Even at the maximum rate, the active site is still specific for acetaldehyde.",
