The senator, who is 61, brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the state statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?\n\nA. Since a fundamental right is involved, the state must show the regulation is necessary to vindicate a compelling government interest.\nB. Since no fundamental right is involved, the petitioner must show the age restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\nC. The state must show the age regulation substantially furthers an important government objective and does not impair the fundamental right to vote.\nD.

            "content": "The correct answer is A. Since a fundamental right is involved, the state must show the regulation is necessary to vindicate a compelling government interest.\n\nIn this case, the fundamental right involved is the right to vote, which is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The state statute in question is a restriction on this right, as it prevents individuals over the age of 60 from running for public office. The state must therefore show that this regulation is necessary to further a compelling government interest, such as promoting political diversity or preventing the exploitation of the elderly by political candidates.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a fundamental right is involved in this case, as the right to vote is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the state does not need to show that the age regulation substantially furthers an important government objective and does not impair the fundamental right to vote. The state must only show that the regulation is necessary to further a compelling government interest.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the burden of persuasion is on the state, not the petitioner. The petitioner must only show that the statute violates due process by depriving her of the right to be a candidate.",
