To find the new price after the first markdown, we multiply the list price by (1 - 0.20) = 0.80.\n3. The new price after the first markdown is $325.00 * 0.80 = $260.00.\n4. In December, the coat is marked down an additional 10 percent. To find the new price after the second markdown, we multiply the new price after the first markdown by (1 - 0.10) = 0.90.\n5. The final price after the second markdown is $260.00 * 0.90 = $234.00.\n\nSo, a Christmas shopper in December would pay $234.00 for the coat. The correct answer is B. $234.00.",
