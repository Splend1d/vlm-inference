            "content": "The problem is asking for the range of integers n (3 <= n <= 11) for which there is only one group of order n (up to isomorphism).\n\nThe order of a group is the number of its elements. For a group to be isomorphic to another group, they must have the same structure and properties. In other words, they must be \"isomorphic\" to each other.\n\nThe order of a group is also the number of its elements. So, if there is only one group of order n, it means that there is only one group of n elements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. For no such integer n: This would mean that there is no group of order n for any integer n in the given range. However, we know that there are groups of order 3, 5, 7, and 11. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. For 3, 5, 7, and 11 only: This would mean that there is only one group of order 3, 5, 7, and 11. However, we know that there are groups of order 4, 6, 8, and 10 as well. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. For 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 only: This would mean that there is only one group of order 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. However, we know that there are groups of order 4, 6, 8, and 10 as well. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. For 4, 6, 8, and 10 only: This would mean that there is only one group of order 4, 6, 8, and 10. This is correct, as there are indeed groups of order 4, 6, 8, and 10, and no other groups of order 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. For 4, 6, 8, and 10 only.",
