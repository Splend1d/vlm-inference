Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\nB. Environmental security is a critical security project in that it questions who and what is to be secured and from what threat by orthodox security policies, or whether linkages between environmental, security and development issues can be made.\nC. Environmental security is a practical endeavour to assess how environmental change causes violent conflict within and between countries, and the ways in which environmental security can undermine national security.\nD. All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested.\n",
