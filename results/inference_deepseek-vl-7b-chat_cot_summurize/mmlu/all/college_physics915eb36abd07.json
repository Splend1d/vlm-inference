            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a closed loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic flux through the circular coil. The magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of the coil, so the magnetic flux is given by the product of the magnetic field and the area of the coil.\n\n\u03a6 = B * A\n\u03a6 = (0.06 T) * (0.2 m^2)\n\u03a6 = 0.012 Wb\n\nNow, we need to find the rate of change of the magnetic flux with respect to time. The magnetic field is increasing from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s.\n\nd\u03a6/dt = (0.06 T - 0.01 T) / 0.25 s\nd\u03a6/dt = 0.05 T / 0.25 s\nd\u03a6/dt = 0.2 T/s\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's law to find the average induced EMF in the coil.\n\nEMF = -d\u03a6/dt\nEMF = -0.2 T/s\n\nFinally, we can convert the EMF from newtons (N) to volts (V) using the formula:\n\nEMF = V\nEMF = -0.2 T/s * (1 V/N)\nEMF = -0.2 V/s\n\nThe average induced EMF in the coil is -0.2 V/s, which is equivalent to 0.2 V.
