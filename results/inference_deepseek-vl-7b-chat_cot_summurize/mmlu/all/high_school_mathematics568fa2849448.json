Therefore, $107^k$ divides $x^n$ for any positive integer $k$ and any positive integer $n$.\n\nWe want to find the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x^{11}$. Since $109$ divides $x$, we know that $109$ divides $x^{11}$. Therefore, $109^m$ divides $x^{11}$ for any positive integer $m$.\n\nWe are given that $107$ and $109$ are prime numbers that divide $x$, so we know that $107^k$ and $109^m$ also divide $x^{11}$ for any positive integers $k$ and $m$.\n\nSince $107$ and $109$ are prime numbers, we know that $107^k$ and $109^m$ are prime numbers.
