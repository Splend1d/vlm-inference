This is the third and final stage of the GAS, where the body's resources have been depleted, and it is no longer able to cope with the stressor. At this point, the body is vulnerable to disease. The other stages are:\n\nC. Alarm: The body's initial response to stress, where it releases stress hormones such as cortisol to prepare for the stressor.\nB. Resistance: The body's attempt to cope with the stressor, where it may use various physiological and behavioral mechanisms to deal with the stress.\nA. Resolution: The body's recovery from the stressor, where it restores its resources and returns to a state of homeostasis.",
