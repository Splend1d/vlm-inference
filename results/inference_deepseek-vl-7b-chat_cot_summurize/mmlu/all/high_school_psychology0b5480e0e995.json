This stage typically occurs in the late teens to early adulthood, around ages 18 to 30. During this stage, young adults grapple with the question of who they are and what they want to become in life. They may experience feelings of uncertainty and confusion about their career, relationships, and personal values. This crisis is a crucial time for identity formation, as individuals must decide on their life goals and make choices that will shape their future.",
