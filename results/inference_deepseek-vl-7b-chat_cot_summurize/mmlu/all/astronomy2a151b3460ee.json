Ozone transmits visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorbs most of the infrared heat trapping the heat near the surface.\nB. Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\nC. Greenhouse gases absorb infrared light from the Sun which then heats the atmosphere and the surface.\nD. Greenhouse gases absorb X-rays and ultraviolet light from the Sun which then heat the atmosphere and the surface.\n",
