This is because the number of ways to choose 12 jurors from a pool of 30% women is the same as the number of ways to choose 12 jurors from a pool of 70% women.\n\nThe probability of choosing 12 jurors from a pool of 30% women is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(at least 3 women) = C(12,3) * (0.3)^3 * (0.7)^9\n\nwhere C(12,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 women from 12 jurors.\n\nUsing the binomial coefficient formula, we have:\n\nC(12,3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!) = 220\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(at least 3 women) = 220 * (0.3)^3 * (0.7)^9 \u2248 0.843\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected jury of 12 will meet the requirements of this trial is approximately 0.843, which corresponds to option B.",
