The production rule S \u2192 ( S ) means that the string \"(\" can be followed by any string of S, and the result is another S.\n2. The production rule S \u2192 x means that the string \"x\" can be followed by any string of S, and the result is another S.\n\nNow, let's consider the statements:\n\nI. The grammar is ambiguous.\n\nAmbiguity in a grammar occurs when there are multiple possible derivations from a given input. In this case, the grammar is ambiguous because both \"(\" and \"x\" can be followed by any string of S. This means that there are multiple possible derivations from a given input, making the grammar ambiguous.\n\nII. The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\n\nTop-down parsing is a parsing technique where the parser starts at the root symbol and tries to build the parse tree by applying the production rules in a top-down manner. In this case, the grammar is not suitable for top-down parsing because the production rules are ambiguous, as explained in statement I.\n\nIII. The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nBottom-up parsing is a parsing technique where the parser starts at the input symbol and tries to build the parse tree by applying the production rules in a bottom-up manner. In this case, the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing because the production rules are unambiguous, as explained in statement I.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III only.",
