            "content": "Statement 1: False\n\nThe VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm. It is a measure of the number of data points that the algorithm can fit without overfitting. The VC dimension is infinite for an SVM with a Radial Base Kernel. However, this does not necessarily mean that the SVM with a Radial Base Kernel is worse than an SVM with a polynomial kernel. The performance of an SVM depends on many factors, including the choice of kernel, the data, and the problem at hand. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that an SVM with a Radial Base Kernel is worse than an SVM with a polynomial kernel.\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nA two-layer neural network with linear activation functions is not essentially a weighted combination of linear separators. The output of a neural network is a function of the input, and the weights are learned during training. The output of a neural network is not simply a linear combination of the input, but rather a nonlinear function of the input. Similarly, the boosting algorithm is not a combination of linear separators. Boosting is a machine learning algorithm that iteratively builds a model by fitting a new model to the errors of the previous model. The final model is a combination of the models learned at each step of the boosting process, but this does not mean that the final model is a linear combination of the models learned at each step.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.
