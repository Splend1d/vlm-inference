The complex numbers C with the standard operations of addition (+) and multiplication (\u00d7) already form an ordered field. The order relation \u2264 is given by the standard order of real numbers, which is a linear order. Therefore, it is not possible to create an ordered field by placing a different linear order on the complex numbers.\n\nC. This statement is false because statement A is true.\n\nD. Both (a) and (b). This statement is false because statement A is true.",
