The women, dissatisfied as they are with this form of government, that enforces taxation without representation,\u2014that compels them to obey laws to which they have never given their consent,\u2014that imprisons and hangs them without a trial by a jury of their peers, that robs them, in marriage, of the custody of their own persons, wages and children,\u2014are this half of the people left wholly at the mercy of the other half, in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this government, every one of which was based on the immutable principle of equal rights to all.\"\n\u2014Susan B. Anthony, \"I Stand Before You Under Indictment\" (speech), 1873\nWhich of the following statements best represents the criticism of Andrew Carnegie found in this cartoon?\n\nA.

The cartoon is not provided, so you will need to use the information given in the text to answer the question.\n\nThe text provided is a speech by Susan B. Anthony, not a cartoon. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the information given.\n\nHowever, if you were to answer the question based on the information provided in the text, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Carnegie was able to give away a great deal of money only because he violated his workers\u2019 rights.\n\nThis is because the text mentions that the people of the nation are powerless to change unjust laws, and it implies that this is similar to the situation of workers who are powerless to change the unjust laws of their employers, such as Andrew Carnegie.",
