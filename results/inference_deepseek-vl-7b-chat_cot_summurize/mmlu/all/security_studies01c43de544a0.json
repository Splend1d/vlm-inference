Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.\nB. The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.\nC. Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.\nD. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.\n",

Strengthening international cooperation and intelligence sharing among law enforcement agencies to effectively combat hierarchical TNCs that are territorially affiliated to a particular state or ethnic-cultural group. This would involve identifying and targeting the key nodes in the hierarchical structure, such as leadership and financial networks, to disrupt and dismantle the organization.\n\nB. Assessing the accuracy of estimates of violence and wealth generated by hierarchical TNCs to inform policy decisions and resource allocation. If the wealth generated by these organizations is not as significant as believed, this could lead to a reassessment of the threat they pose to the legitimate economy and inform more targeted law enforcement strategies.\n\nC. Emphasizing the adaptability of hierarchical TNCs and the need for law enforcement agencies to be agile and flexible in their response. This could involve adopting a more adaptive and adaptive strategy that allows for the identification and disruption of hierarchical structures, as well as the use of intelligence-led policing to target the leadership and financial networks of these organizations.\n\nD. Recognizing the potential for hierarchical TNCs to pose a serious degree of harm through their profit-driven crimes. This could lead to a focus on targeting the proceeds and leadership of these organizations to reduce their threat to the legitimate economy. This could involve a combination of law enforcement efforts, financial sanctions, and international cooperation to disrupt and dismantle these organizations.",
