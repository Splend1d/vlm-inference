The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated.\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall.\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.\n\nA. II only\nB. III only\nC. I and IV only\nD. I and III and IV only\n",

In this case, the dependent variables are:\n\nI. The number of facts the subjects can recall. This is the main outcome the psychologist is interested in, as it will show how well the subjects were able to learn the fabricated facts.\n\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall. This is also a dependent variable because it is the outcome the psychologist is measuring, regardless of the compensation or the room in which the subjects are asked to recall the facts.\n\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts. This is a dependent variable because it is the factor that the psychologist is measuring to see how it affects the outcome, which is the number of facts the subjects can recall.\n\nSo, the dependent variables in this experiment are I, III, and IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and III and IV only.",
