            "content": "To find the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes, we need to find the standard deviation of the weights of the books, the weights of the boxes, and the weights of the packing material, and then take their weighted average.\n\nThe weights of the books have a mean of 25 pounds and a standard deviation of 2 pounds. The weights of the boxes have a mean of 1 pound and a standard deviation of 0.15 pounds. The weights of the packing material have a mean of 2 pounds and a standard deviation of 0.25 pounds.\n\nThe weights of the packed boxes are the sum of the weights of the books, the weights of the boxes, and the weights of the packing material. The standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes is given by:\n\nStandard Deviation = sqrt((Weight of books standard deviation)^2 + (Weight of boxes standard deviation)^2 + (Weight of packing material standard deviation)^2) * sqrt(Weight of books / Weight of boxes / Weight of packing material)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nStandard Deviation = sqrt((2)^2 + (0.15)^2 + (0.25)^2) * sqrt(25 / 1 / 2)\nStandard Deviation = sqrt(4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625) * sqrt(12.5)\nStandard Deviation = sqrt(4.2875) * sqrt(12.5)\nStandard Deviation \u2248 2.021\n\nSo, the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes is approximately 2.021 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 2.021 pounds.",
