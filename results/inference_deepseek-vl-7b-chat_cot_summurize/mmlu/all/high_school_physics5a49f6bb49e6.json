            "content": "To find the angle at which the cannon should be pointed, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nhorizontal_distance = initial_horizontal_velocity * time + 0.5 * initial_vertical_velocity * time^2\n\nwhere:\n- horizontal_distance is the distance the ball travels horizontally\n- initial_horizontal_velocity is the final horizontal velocity of the ball (50 m/s)\n- initial_vertical_velocity is the vertical velocity of the ball (0 m/s, since the ball is launched from rest)\n- time is the time it takes for the ball to travel the horizontal distance\n\nFirst, we need to find the time it takes for the ball to travel the horizontal distance. We can use the formula:\n\ntime = horizontal_distance / initial_horizontal_velocity\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\ntime = 5 m / 50 m/s = 0.1 s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the kinematic equation:\n\nhorizontal_distance = 50 m/s * 0.1 s + 0.5 * 0 m/s * (0.1 s)^2\nhorizontal_distance = 5 m\n\nSince the ball is launched from rest, the vertical velocity is 0 m/s. The ball will travel a distance of 5 m horizontally before hitting the level surface.\n\nNow, we can find the angle at which the cannon should be pointed. We can use the following formula:\n\ntan(angle) = horizontal_velocity / vertical_velocity\n\nwhere:\n- angle is the angle at which the cannon should be pointed\n- horizontal_velocity is the final horizontal velocity of the ball (50 m/s)\n- vertical_velocity is the vertical velocity of the ball (0 m/s)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ntan(angle) = 50 m/s / 0 m/s = 50\n\nNow, we can find the angle:\n\nangle = arctan(50)\nangle \u2248 49.8\u00b0\n\nHowever, since the angle must be in the range of 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, we can round the angle to the nearest whole number:\n\nangle \u2248 49\u00b0\n\nSo, the operator should point the cannon at an angle of 49\u00b0 from the horizontal. The correct answer is:\n\nD. 49\u00b0",
