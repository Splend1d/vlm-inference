The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held\n\nA. enforceable.\nB. unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.\nC. unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.\nD. unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.\n",

The written contract only sets a maximum limit of 10,000 boxes per month, but it does not specify that the manufacturer cannot agree to supply more boxes in the first month. Therefore, the oral agreement is not in conflict with the written contract and can be enforced.\n\nB. is incorrect because the oral agreement is not unenforceable due to the written contract.\n\nC. is incorrect because the oral agreement is not unenforceable due to the parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule prevents parties from relying on oral agreements to contradict written agreements. However, in this case, the oral agreement does not contradict the written contract, so the parol evidence rule does not apply.\n\nD. is incorrect because there is adequate consideration for the manufacturer's oral agreement. Consideration is the value received by one party as a result of a promise made by the other party. In this case, the consideration is the additional 5,000 boxes that the producer is willing to pay for.",
