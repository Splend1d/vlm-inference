These diseases, such as those caused by the bacterium Plasmodium, which causes malaria, and the viruses that cause influenza, were likely responsible for the extinction of these large animals.\n\nB. environmental changes is incorrect because while environmental changes may have contributed to the extinction of some species, it was the combination of human activity and environmental changes that was most likely responsible for the extinction of the megafauna.\n\nC. both humans and environmental changes is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the primary cause of the extinction. The primary cause was likely the introduction of diseases by humans, which led to the collapse of the megafauna populations.\n\nD. humans who carried diseases over the land bridge is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the primary cause of the extinction. While humans did carry diseases, it was the combination of human activity and environmental changes that was most likely responsible for the extinction of the megafauna.",
