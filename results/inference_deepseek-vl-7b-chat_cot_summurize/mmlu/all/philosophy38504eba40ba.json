He famously stated, \"If there were no good, there would be no evil.\" This is based on his understanding of the nature of evil as a privation or lack of good. In other words, evil is not something positive but rather the absence of the positive qualities of good.\n\nAugustine's view is often referred to as \"privation theory\" or \"the absence of good theory.\" He argued that evil is not a positive thing but rather a lack of the positive qualities of good. This perspective is in contrast to the \"substance theory\" of evil, which posits that evil is a distinct substance or entity.\n\nAugustine's view has been influential in Western philosophy and theology, particularly in the development of the concept of evil as a privation of good. This perspective has been challenged and developed by later philosophers and theologians, but Augustine's initial insight remains a significant part of the philosophical discussion of evil.",
