            "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the profit per phone: Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $200 - $125 = $75\n2. Calculate the desired profit: Desired profit = 10% of sales = 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold)\n3. Calculate the total profit: Total profit = Desired profit + Sales commission + Monthly fixed costs = 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) + $25 * Units sold + $3000\n4. Set up an equation to solve for Units sold: 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) + $25 * Units sold + $3000 = 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) + $25 * Units sold\n5. Simplify the equation: 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) + $25 * Units sold + $3000 = 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) + $25 * Units sold\n6. Move the terms with Units sold to one side: 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) - 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) = $3000 - $25 * Units sold\n7. Simplify the equation: 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) - 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) = $3000 - $25 * Units sold\n8. Factor out the common terms: 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) - 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) = $3000 - $25 * Units sold\n9. Set the equation equal to zero: 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) - 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) = $3000 - $25 * Units sold = 0\n10. Solve for Units sold: 0.1 * (Selling price * Units sold) - 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) = $3000 - $25 * Units sold = 0\n11. Plug in the values: 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) - 0.1 * ($200 * Units sold) = $3000 - $25 * Units sold = 0\n12. Simplify the equation: 0 = $3000 - $25 * Units sold\n13. Solve for Units sold: $25 * Units sold = $3000\n14. Divide both sides by $25: Units sold = $3000 / $25 = 120\n\nSo, Spark must sell 120 units to achieve a desired profit of 10% of sales.
