Yes, with p=2:\nf(x) mod 2 = x^2 mod 2 = 0 (no solutions)\n\nB. Yes, with p=3:\nf(x) mod 3 = x^2 mod 3 = 0 (no solutions)\n\nC. Yes, with p=5:\nf(x) mod 5 = x^2 mod 5 = 0 (no solutions)\n\nD. No:\nf(x) mod 4 = x^2 mod 4 = 1 (one solution)\n\nSince f(x) has a non-zero solution modulo 4, it is not irreducible over Q by the Eisenstein Criterion. Therefore, the answer is D.",
