Accordingly, as part of her analysis she plans to generate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for the two variables. The interval is determined to be (0.45, 0.80). Which of the following is (are) true? (Assume conditions for inference are met.) I. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. II. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables. III. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.\n\nA. I and II only\nB. I and III only\nC.

This means that we are 95% confident that the true slope of the regression line lies between 0.45 and 0.80. \n\nI. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables: This is true. A 95% confidence interval that includes 0 (0.45, 0.80) indicates that we are 95% confident that the true slope of the regression line is non-zero, which means there is a linear relationship between the variables.\n\nII. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables: This is also true. A 95% confidence interval that includes 0 (0.45, 0.80) indicates that we are 95% confident that the true slope of the regression line is non-zero, which means there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables.\n\nIII. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0: This is false.
