            "content": "To find the carrying amount of the machine at the end of its second year of operations, we need to calculate the depreciation for the first year and the second year.\n\nThe double-declining balance method is calculated as follows:\n\nDepreciation for the first year = (Cost - Salvage Value) / (Number of Years * 2)\nDepreciation for the second year = (Cost - Salvage Value) / (Number of Years * 2)\n\nCost = $140,000\nSalvage Value = $60,000\nNumber of Years = 8\n\nDepreciation for the first year = ($140,000 - $60,000) / (8 * 2) = $80,000 / 16 = $5,000\nDepreciation for the second year = ($140,000 - $60,000) / (8 * 2) = $80,000 / 16 = $5,000\n\nCarrying amount of the machine at the end of the second year = Cost - (Depreciation for the first year + Depreciation for the second year)\nCarrying amount of the machine at the end of the second year = $140,000 - ($5,000 + $5,000) = $140,000 - $10,000 = $130,000\n\nThe closest answer is C. $78,750.",
