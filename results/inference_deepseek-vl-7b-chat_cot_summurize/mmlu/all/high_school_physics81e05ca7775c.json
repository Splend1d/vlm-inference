            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of energy principle. The proton's kinetic energy is conserved, so we can write the initial kinetic energy as:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m * v_initial^2\n\nwhere m is the proton's mass and v_initial is its initial speed.\n\nThe proton's initial speed is given as 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, so we can write:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m * (1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s)^2\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of energy principle to find the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field:\n\nKE_final = KE_initial + (1/2) * m * (v_final)^2\n\nwhere KE_final is the proton's final kinetic energy and v_final is its final speed.\n\nWe are given that the proton's initial velocity vector makes an angle of 30\u00b0 with the magnetic field. We can use the sine and cosine functions to find the components of the proton's velocity vector in the magnetic field:\n\nv_x = v_initial * cos(30\u00b0)\nv_y = v_initial * sin(30\u00b0)\n\nNow, we can find the proton's speed in the x-direction:\n\nv_x = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * cos(30\u00b0)\n\nWe are given that the proton's speed in the x-direction is 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, so we can write:\n\n1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * cos(30\u00b0)\n\nNow, we can find the proton's speed in the y-direction:\n\nv_y = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * sin(30\u00b0)\n\nWe are given that the proton's speed in the y-direction is 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, so we can write:\n\n1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * sin(30\u00b0)\n\nNow, we can find the proton's speed in the z-direction:\n\nv_z = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2)\n\nWe are given that the proton's speed in the z-direction is 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, so we can write:\n\n1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = sqrt(1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s^2^2 + 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s^2^2)\n\nNow, we can find the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field:\n\nv_final = v_x * cos(30\u00b0) + v_y * sin(30\u00b0)\n\nWe are given that the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field is 7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, so we can write:\n\n7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * cos(30\u00b0) + 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * sin(30\u00b0)\n\nNow, we can solve for the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field:\n\n7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * cos(30\u00b0) + 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * sin(30\u00b0)\n\n7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * (0.577350269191 + 0.577350269191)\n\n7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * 1.15469053858\n\n7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s = 1.72138107716\n\nNow, we can find the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field:\n\nv_final = 7.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s / 1.72138107716\n\n",
