            "content": "Statement 1: Maximizing the likelihood of a logistic regression model yields multiple local optimums. This statement is true. In logistic regression, the maximum likelihood estimation involves finding the value of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. However, due to the non-convex nature of the logistic loss function, the maximum likelihood estimation can result in multiple local optima.\n\nStatement 2: No classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known. This statement is false. While a naive Bayes classifier is simple and can perform well when the distribution of the data is known, there are other classifiers that can perform better in certain situations. For example, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines can also achieve good performance when the data distribution is known.",
