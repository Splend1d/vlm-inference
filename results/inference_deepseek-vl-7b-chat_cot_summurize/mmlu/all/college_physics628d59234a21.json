            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation. Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when an object with high velocity approaches the speed of light. The time it takes for an event to occur in the rest frame of the object is different from the time it takes in the rest frame of an observer.\n\nIn this case, the meter stick is moving at a speed of 0.8c relative to the observer. To find the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer, we need to find the time dilation factor (\u03c4) in the observer's rest frame.\n\nThe time dilation factor (\u03c4) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03c4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the object (0.8c in this case) and c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\n\u03c4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8^2 / 3.0 x 10^8^2))\n\u03c4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.0125 / 3.0 x 10^8^2))\n\u03c4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.0004)\n\u03c4 = 1 / sqrt(0.9996)\n\u03c4 \u2248 1.0002\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer in the observer's rest frame:\n\nTime in observer's rest frame = 1 / \u03c4\nTime in observer's rest frame = 1 / 1.0002\nTime in observer's rest frame \u2248 1000.2 ns\n\nHowever, the given options do not include 1000.2 ns. This is because the options are likely rounded to the nearest significant figure. To find the closest option, we can round the time to the nearest whole number:\n\nTime in observer's rest frame \u2248 1000 ns\n\nSo, the closest option is:\n\nB. 2.5 ns",
