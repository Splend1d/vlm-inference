            "content": "To find the pH of the solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of a weak acid to its Ka, the concentration of the acid, and the concentration of its conjugate base.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is given by:\n\npH = pKa + (log([A^-]/[HA]))/(log([B^-]/[HB]) + (log([A^-]/[HA]))\n\nIn this case, we have a weak acid (hypochlorous acid, HClO) and its conjugate base (water, H2O). The Ka for HClO is given as 3.0 \u00d7 10^-4. The concentration of HClO is 0.1665 mol/L, and the volume of the solution is 500 mL.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of the solution to moles. Since 1 L = 1000 mL, the volume in moles is:\n\n0.5 L = 0.5 \u00d7 1000 mol = 500 mol\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 1.76\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is 1.76. The correct answer is D.",
