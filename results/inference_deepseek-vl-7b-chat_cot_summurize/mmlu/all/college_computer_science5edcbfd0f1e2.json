            "content": "A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\nB. 1.2 microseconds\nC. 1.6 microseconds\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the time taken for each operation and the time taken for the CPU instructions.\n\n1. Time taken for one digitization: 12 microseconds\n2. Time taken for five CPU instructions: 5 * 12 = 60 microseconds\n3. Time taken for one average: 10 CPU instructions * 12 microseconds per instruction = 120 microseconds\n\nNow, let's add up the time taken for each operation:\n\n1. Time taken for one digitization: 12 microseconds\n2. Time taken for five CPU instructions: 60 microseconds\n3. Time taken for one average: 120 microseconds\n\nTotal time taken: 12 + 60 + 120 = 192 microseconds\n\nSince the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is 0.8 microseconds, we can set up the following equation:\n\n192 microseconds = 0.8 microseconds\n\nTo solve for the maximum average instruction execution time, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\n192 / 0.8 = 240 microseconds\n\nTherefore, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is 240 microseconds.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match this result. It is possible that there may be a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.",
