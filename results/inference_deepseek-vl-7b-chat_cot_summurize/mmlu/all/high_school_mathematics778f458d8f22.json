This means that each term in the sequence can be written as $F_n \\equiv F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\pmod{4}$.\n\nWe can start by finding the first few terms of the sequence modulo 4:\n\n$F_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_6 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_7 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_8 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$\n$F_9 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n\nWe can see that the sequence repeats every 6 terms. Since $100 \\div 6 = 16$ with a remainder of 4, the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the Fibonacci sequence is the same as the 4th term, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is $\\boxed{A}$.",
