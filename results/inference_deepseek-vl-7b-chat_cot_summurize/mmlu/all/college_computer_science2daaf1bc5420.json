Let's try to find a pattern in the growth rate.\n\nT(n) = 3n + T(n-1)\nT(n) = 3n + 3(n-1) + T(n-2)\nT(n) = 3n + 3n - 3 + T(n-2)\nT(n) = 6n + T(n-2)\n\nNow, let's find the growth rate of T(n) for a few values of n:\n\nT(2) = 6(2) + T(0) = 12 + T(0)\nT(3) = 6(3) + T(1) = 18 + 7 = 25\nT(4) = 6(4) + T(2) = 24 + 12 = 36\nT(5) = 6(5) + T(3) = 30 + 25 = 55\n\nWe can see that the growth rate of T(n) is approximately linear, with a slope of 6. Therefore, the order of growth of T(n) is \u0398(n^2).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \u0398(n^2)",
