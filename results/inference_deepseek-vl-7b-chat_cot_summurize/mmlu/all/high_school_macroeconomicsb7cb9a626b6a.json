U.S. GDP falls and Brazil's GDP rises.\n\nWhen an American firm moves its manufacturing plant from the United States to Brazil, it implies that the production of goods and services will be shifted from the United States to Brazil. This change will result in a decrease in the production and GDP of the United States, while the production and GDP of Brazil will increase.\n\nThe decrease in the United States' GDP is due to the loss of jobs and economic activity in the manufacturing sector, which contributes to the overall GDP. The increase in Brazil's GDP is due to the new investment, jobs, and economic activity that the American firm brings to the country, which contributes to the overall GDP.\n\nIt is important to note that the impact on GDP in both countries will depend on various factors such as the scale of the investment, the number of jobs created or lost, and the overall economic conditions in both countries. However, in this scenario, the net effect will be a decrease in the United States' GDP and an increase in Brazil's GDP.",
