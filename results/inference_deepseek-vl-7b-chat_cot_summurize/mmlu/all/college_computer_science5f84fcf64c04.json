In this case, (aw)^M = aw^Ma, which means a^M = a.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nA. a^M = a: This is true according to the base case.\n\nB. (ax)^M = (xa)^M: This is not necessarily true. For example, if x = \"a\" and a = \"b\", then (ax)^M = \"ab^M\" and (xa)^M = \"a^Mb\", which are not equal.\n\nC. (xy)^M = y^Mx^M: This is not necessarily true. For example, if x = \"a\" and y = \"b\", then (xy)^M = \"ab^M\" and y^Mx^M = \"b^Ma\", which are not equal.\n\nD. None of the above: This is not true because option A is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",
