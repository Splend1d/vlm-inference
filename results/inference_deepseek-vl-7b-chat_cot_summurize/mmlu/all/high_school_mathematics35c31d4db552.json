This means that as the input increases or decreases, so does the output.\n\nGiven that c < d, this means that c is a smaller value than d. If we apply the linear function to these values, the output will be smaller for c and larger for d.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. f (c) = f (d)\nThis statement is true. Since the slope of the function is nonzero, the output will be the same for both c and d.\n\nB. f (c) \u2260 f (d)\nThis statement is false. As explained above, the output will be the same for both c and d.\n\nC. f (c) > f (d)\nThis statement is false. As explained above, the output will be smaller for c and larger for d.\n\nD. f (c) < f (d)\nThis statement is true. As explained above, the output will be larger for d and smaller for c.\n\nSo, the statement that must be false is option B.",
