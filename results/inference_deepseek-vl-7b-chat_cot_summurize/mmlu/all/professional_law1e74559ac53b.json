Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. The man's nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it during his uncle's absence. When the man returned from his mother's home in 1999, he continued in possession until 2010 when the womanbrought an ejectment action. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. The court would most likely hold that\n\nA. the woman was the rightful owner and thus entitled to possess the farm.\nB. the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.\nC. the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.\nD. the man was entitled to possession, because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is C. the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe adverse possession statute in the state requires that the possessor's possession be open, notorious, continuous, and hostile for a period of 20 years. \n\n1. Open: The man took possession of the land in 1987 and continued to live on the land until 2010. This means that his possession was not secretive or hidden.\n\n2. Notorious: The man's possession was well-known to the woman and the public. The woman knew about his possession because she was aware of his nephew's agreement to take care of the farm during his uncle's absence. The public also knew about his possession because he lived on the land for 23 years.\n\n3. Continuous: The man's possession was uninterrupted for 23 years. He took possession in 1987 and continued to live on the land until 2010.\n\n4. Hostile: The man's possession was not friendly or amicable. He took possession of the land without the woman's permission and without any legal claim to the land.\n\nSince the man's possession met all the requirements of the adverse possession statute, the court would most likely hold that he was entitled to possession of the farm.",
