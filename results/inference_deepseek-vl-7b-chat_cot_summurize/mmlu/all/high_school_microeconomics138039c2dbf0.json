When the goods on the axes are perfect substitutes in consumption, the PPF will be a straight line. This means that the two goods are identical in terms of their utility to consumers, and the production of one good does not affect the production of the other. In this case, the PPF will be a straight line because the production of one good does not affect the production of the other, and the country can produce any combination of the two goods along this line.\n\nWhen efficiency is achieved, the PPF will also be a straight line. This means that the country is producing the maximum possible output of both goods, given its resources and technology. In this case, the PPF will be a straight line because the country is producing the maximum possible output of both goods, and the production of one good does not affect the production of the other.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. efficiency is achieved.",
