The EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical will show these 5 unpaired electrons.\n\nThe ratio of line intensities in the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and the total number of electrons in the system. In this case, there are 5 unpaired electrons, so the ratio of line intensities will be 5:19:36:84:126:126:84:36:19:1. This ratio represents the different multiplets of the t-Bu radical in the EPR spectrum.",
