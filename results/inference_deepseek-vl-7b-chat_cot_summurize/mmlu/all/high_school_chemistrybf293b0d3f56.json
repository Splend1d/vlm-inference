We can do this by subtracting the mass of the precipitate from the mass of the original solution.\n\nOriginal solution mass = 2.35 g\nMass of precipitate = 0.435 g\n\nAmount of chloride ions in the original solution = Original solution mass - Mass of precipitate\n= 2.35 g - 0.435 g\n= 1.915 g\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of chlorine in the sample:\n\nPercentage of chlorine = (Amount of chloride ions in the original solution / Original solution mass) * 100\n= (1.915 g / 2.35 g) * 100\n= 0.805 * 100\n= 80.5%\n\nThe closest answer to 80.5% is 43.50%, so the correct answer is C. 43.50%.",
