The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nThe instructions indicated in the fourth paragraph to remain nonviolent most likely inspired which of the following historical developments?\n\nA. The Zionist movement that created the modern state of Israel\nB. The independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule\nC. The civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States\nD. The communist movement that changed the government of Cuba\n",

            "content": "The instructions indicated in the fourth paragraph to remain nonviolent most likely inspired the civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States. This is because the message from Mahatma Gandhi emphasizes the importance of unity and non-violence in the face of injustice, which is a key principle of the civil rights movement. The civil rights movement in the United States fought for equal rights for minorities, and their non-violent protests and boycotts were a significant part of their strategy. The other options, such as the Zionist movement, independence movements in southeast Asia, and the communist movement in Cuba, do not have a clear connection to the idea of remaining non-violent in the face of injustice.",
