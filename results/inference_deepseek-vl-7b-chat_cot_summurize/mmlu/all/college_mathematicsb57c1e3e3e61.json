A power series converges to a value if the absolute value of the terms decreases as the index increases.\n\nLet's analyze each interval:\n\n(I) [\u22121, 3): This interval is not valid for convergence because the series can have negative terms, which can lead to divergence.\n\n(II) (\u2212\u221e, 0]: This interval is valid for convergence. As the index increases, the absolute value of the terms decreases, and the series converges to a value.\n\n(III) [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3]: This interval is not valid for convergence because it includes both positive and negative values, which can lead to divergence.\n\n(IV) (\u2212\u221e,\u221e): This interval is valid for convergence. As the index increases, the absolute value of the terms decreases, and the series converges to a value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (II) and (IV), which are valid intervals of convergence for a power series.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
