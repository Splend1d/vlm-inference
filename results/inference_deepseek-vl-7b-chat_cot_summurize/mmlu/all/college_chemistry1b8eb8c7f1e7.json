The Larmor frequency is related to the magnetic field strength by the formula:\n\n\u03c90 = \u03b3B0\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus. For a typical NMR experiment, \u03b3 is approximately 42.54 MHz/T.\n\nHowever, without knowing the magnetic field strength (B0) and the Larmor frequency (\u03c90), we cannot calculate the total relaxation time (T1) and, consequently, the linewidth.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the correct answer from the given options.",
