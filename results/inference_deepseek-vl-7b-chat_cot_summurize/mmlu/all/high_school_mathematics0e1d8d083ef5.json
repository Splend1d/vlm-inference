Since the square has the same perimeter as the equilateral triangle, the perimeter of the square is 3 times the side length of the equilateral triangle.\n\nPerimeter of the square = 3 * side length of the equilateral triangle\nPerimeter of the square = 3 * 8\nPerimeter of the square = 24\n\nNow, we know that the perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side. So, we can find the length of one side of the square:\n\nLength of one side of the square = Perimeter of the square / 4\nLength of one side of the square = 24 / 4\nLength of one side of the square = 6\n\nNow that we have the length of one side of the square, we can find the area of the square:\n\nArea of the square = (side length of the square)^2\nArea of the square = (6)^2\nArea of the square = 36\n\nSo, the area of the square is 36, which corresponds to option C.",
