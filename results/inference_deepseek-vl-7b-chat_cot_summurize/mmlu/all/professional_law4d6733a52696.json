            "content": "A driver was having trouble finding a place to park his car near a store at which he needed to make a quick stop to purchase something. He decided to just park along the road next to the store, even though there was not really a lane or space there intended for parking. The driver pulled his car as far off the roadway as he could and figured that it would be fine because he would only be in the store for a few minutes. While the driver was in the store, a car driven by a woman approached the spot where the driver had left his car. When the woman saw the driver's car and realized it was partially obstructing the road, she tried to avoid hitting it but crashed into it. The accident caused $5,000 worth of damage to the driver's car and $1,000 worth of damage to the woman's car. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules and that the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. How much, if anything, could the driver recover in a lawsuit against the woman for negligence?\n\nA. $5,000, or the full amount of damages to his car.\nB. $4,000, or the full amount of his damages, minus the woman's damages.\nC. $2,500, or half of his damages.\nD. Nothing, because the driver was contributorily negligent for parking his car so that part of it stuck out into the street.\n",

            "content": "B. $4,000, or the full amount of his damages, minus the woman's damages.\n\nThe driver could potentially recover the full amount of damages to his car ($5,000) in a lawsuit against the woman for negligence. However, under traditional contributory negligence rules, the driver's recovery would be reduced by the percentage of his own negligence. Since the driver parked his car in a location that was not intended for parking and obstructed the road, he would be considered contributorily negligent.\n\nIn this case, the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision, and the driver's parking was a significant contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, the driver would likely be found to be more than 50% at fault for the accident. Under contributory negligence, the driver's recovery would be reduced by his percentage of fault, which would be more than 50%.\n\nAs a result, the driver could potentially recover $4,000, or the full amount of his damages, minus the woman's damages ($5,000 - $1,000 = $4,000). This would be the maximum amount the driver could recover in a lawsuit against the woman for negligence, assuming the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules and the driver is found to be more than 50% at fault.",
