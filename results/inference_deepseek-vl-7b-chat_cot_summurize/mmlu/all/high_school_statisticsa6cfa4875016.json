So, E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y).\n\nThe variance of a sum of random variables is the sum of the variances of the individual random variables, multiplied by the common denominator of the variances. So, var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y).\n\nGiven E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(Y) = 307, and var(Y) = 8, we can calculate the expected value and variance of X + Y as follows:\n\nE(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 312 + 307 = 619\n\nvar(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) = 6 + 8 = 14\n\nSo, the expected value of X + Y is 619, and the variance of X + Y is 14. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 14",
