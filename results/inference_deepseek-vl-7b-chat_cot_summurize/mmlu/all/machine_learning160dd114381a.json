The entropy of a joint distribution is always greater than or equal to the sum of the entropies of the individual distributions. This is a fundamental property of entropy and is known as the subadditivity of entropy.\n\nStatement 2: For some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges present in the graph.\n\nThis statement is also true. Moralization is a process in graph theory that involves removing edges from a graph to make it more \"moral,\" meaning that the graph becomes a tree (a connected graph with no cycles). In some cases, this process can reduce the number of edges in the graph.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A. True, True.",
