This increased affordability can lead to a decrease in the demand for daycare services. As a result, the market price for daycare services is likely to fall.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a subsidy would make daycare services more affordable, not less. Option C is also incorrect because a subsidy would not typically lead to an increase in the supply of daycare services. Option D is incorrect because a subsidy would not typically lead to a decrease in the supply of daycare services.",
