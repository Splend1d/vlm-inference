Program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a program\u2019s staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research.\nB. Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.\nC. Traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.\nD. Both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data in order to address their aims.\n",

Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.\n\nThis statement is not true because both traditional research and program evaluation can have similar aims. Traditional research can also aim to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, and program evaluation can also collect information important for decision-making. The main difference between the two is the context and purpose, not the aims.",
