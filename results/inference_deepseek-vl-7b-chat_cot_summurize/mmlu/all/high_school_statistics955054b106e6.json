Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?\n\nA. The correlation coefficient is -0.71.\nB. The correlation coefficient is 0.71.\nC. The correlation coefficient is -0.84.\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n",

The correlation coefficient is 0.71.\n\nIn the given study, it was found that the number of calls per minute explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. This means that there is a strong positive correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests. The correlation coefficient, which measures the strength and direction of this relationship, is 0.71.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they provide different correlation coefficients:\n\nA. The correlation coefficient is -0.71: This is incorrect because the correlation coefficient is actually 0.71, not -0.71.\n\nC. The correlation coefficient is -0.84: This is incorrect because the correlation coefficient is positive, not negative.\n\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84: This is incorrect because the correlation coefficient is actually 0.71, not 0.84.",
