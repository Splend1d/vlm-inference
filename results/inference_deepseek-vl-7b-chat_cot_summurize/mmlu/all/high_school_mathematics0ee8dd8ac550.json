            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of children), k is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, the number of girls), p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a girl being born), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least half of the children are girls, which means we need to find the probability of having 3, 4, or 5 girls. So, we need to calculate the probabilities for k = 3, 4, and 5 and then sum them up.\n\nP(X >= 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probabilities for k = 3, 4, and 5:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^(5-3)\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^(5-4)\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^(5-5)\n\nNow, let's calculate the combinations:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5\nC(5, 5) = 5! / (5! * (5-5)!) = 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 = 10 * (1/8) * (1/4) = 10/32\nP(X = 4) = 5 * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^1 = 5 * (1/16) * (1/2) = 5/32\nP(X = 5) = 1 * (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^0 = (1/32) * (1) = 1/32\n\nFinally, let's sum up the probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) = 10/32 + 5/32 + 1/32 = 16/32 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability that at least half of John's children are girls is 1/2, which corresponds to option A.",
