            "content": "An athlete hoped to sign a contract with a professional baseball team to play baseball. He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, \"If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. \" The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be\n\nA. a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.\nB. a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\nC. the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.\nD. a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n",

            "content": "The most applicable legal principle in this case would be D. a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n\nThis principle applies because the athlete's agreement with his friend was a gratuitous (or gratuitous) assignment. This means that the athlete made the agreement without receiving any consideration (or payment) in return. Since the agreement was not in exchange for any consideration, it is considered to be revocable, meaning that the athlete has the right to change his mind and not fulfill the agreement.\n\nIn this case, the athlete decided to pay his friend only $1,000 instead of the 10 percent of his first-year earnings that he had agreed to. Since the agreement was gratuitous, the athlete has the right to revoke the agreement and not pay his friend the full amount.\n\nThe other options do not apply in this case. Option A refers to a promise to assign a right when it arises, which is not applicable because the athlete did not make a promise to assign a right that has not yet arisen. Option B refers to a contract to make a future assignment of a right, which is not applicable because the athlete did not make a contract to assign a right that has not yet arisen. Option C refers to the friend not detrimentally relying on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete, which is not applicable because the friend did not rely on the agreement before the athlete decided to revoke it.",
