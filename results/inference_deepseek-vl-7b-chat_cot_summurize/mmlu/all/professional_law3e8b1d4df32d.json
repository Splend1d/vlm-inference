They pushed the victim inside her house and threatened her with bodily harm if she didn't cooperate. After tying her up with ropes, the trio then proceeded to ransack the victim's home. They then placed many of the victim's valuables and other possessions into a large sack and hurriedly left her house. What crimes should the defendants be convicted of?\n\nA. Assault, battery, and robbery.\nB. Larceny, robbery, and burglary.\nC. Robbery and burglary.\nD. Robbery only.\n",

Assault and battery: The defendants threatened the victim with bodily harm, which constitutes assault and battery.\n2. Robbery: The defendants stole the victim's valuables and possessions, which is a form of robbery.\n3. Burglary: The defendants entered the victim's home without permission, which is a form of burglary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because assault and battery are separate crimes from robbery, and the defendants did not commit robbery alone. Option D is incorrect because robbery is a part of option B, and the defendants committed robbery as well as other crimes. Option C is incorrect because robbery and burglary are separate crimes from larceny, and the defendants did not commit larceny alone.",
