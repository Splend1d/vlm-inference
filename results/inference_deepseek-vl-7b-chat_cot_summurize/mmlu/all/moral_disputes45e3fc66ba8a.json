This is because objectification reduces a person to an object, stripping them of their individuality and humanity.\n\nOption A is not supported by Papadaki's argument, as she does not argue that sexual objectification is always wrong.\n\nOption B is not entirely accurate, as Papadaki does not argue that sexual objectification involves the total reduction of a person to an object. Instead, she argues that it involves the denial of a person's humanity, which is a more nuanced claim.\n\nOption C is not relevant to Papadaki's argument, as she does not discuss the Kantian terms used to explain sexual objectification.",
