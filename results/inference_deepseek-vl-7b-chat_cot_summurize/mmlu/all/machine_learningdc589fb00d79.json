The margins obtained from a training set do not necessarily reflect the performance of a classifier on an unseen test set. The margins obtained from a training set are a measure of how well the classifier can separate the classes in the training data, but this does not necessarily translate to how well the classifier will perform on new, unseen data.\n\nStatement 2: The activation function of BERT is the GELU.\n\nThis statement is false. The activation function used in BERT is the GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit), but this is not the only activation function that can be used in neural networks. Other activation functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or Sigmoid, can also be used.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
