            "content": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we can use Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of reflection is constant for a given medium. The equation is:\n\nsin(i) / sin(r) = n1 / n2\n\nwhere i is the angle of incidence, r is the angle of reflection, n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium, and n2 is the index of refraction of the second medium.\n\nIn this case, the incident light (white light) has a wavelength of 500 nm (500 nm) and the index of refraction of water (n1) is 1.33. The oil (n2) has an index of refraction of 1.5.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the angle of reflection (r):\n\nsin(r) = n2 / n1 * sin(i)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for r:\n\nsin(r) = 1.5 / 1.33 * sin(500 nm)\n\nr \u2248 60.1\u00b0\n\nNow, we can find the wavelength of the most strongly reflected light by using the inverse tangent function:\n\nr = arctan(sin(r))\n\nr = arctan(sin(60.1\u00b0))\n\nr \u2248 600 nm\n\nSo, the most strongly reflected wavelength is approximately 600 nm. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 600 nm",
