            "content": "A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nUnder the common law of riparian rights, the person who owns land adjacent to a watercourse has the right to use the water that flows through their land. However, the doctrine of prior appropriation states that the right to use water is based on the first use of the water, and the first user has the right to continue using the water.\n\nIn this case, the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956 and started using the water from the stream to irrigate the southern half of his property. He has continuously used the water for this purpose, and he has not stopped using the water since he started. The rancher, on the other hand, started taking water from the stream in 1986 for domestic purposes.\n\nThe court should rule in favor of the millionaire because he has the superior right to the water under the doctrine of prior appropriation. The rancher's use of the water for domestic purposes is not superior to the millionaire's use of the water for irrigation, and the rancher's use is a later appropriation of the water. Therefore, the court should rule in favor of the millionaire and allow him to continue using the water for his beneficial use of irrigation.",
