Then the second term is $9+d$, and the third term is $9+2d$.\n\nWhen 2 is added to the second term, we get $(9+d)+2=9+d+2$.\nWhen 20 is added to the third term, we get $(9+2d)+20=9+2d+20$.\n\nThese two expressions form a geometric progression, so we have the equation $(9+d)+2=9+2d+20$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $d=17$.\n\nThe third term of the geometric progression is $9+2d=9+2(17)=\\boxed{31}$.\nThe answer is: 31",
