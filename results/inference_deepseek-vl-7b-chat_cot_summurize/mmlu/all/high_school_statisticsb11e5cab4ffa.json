A 95% confidence interval for a proportion is calculated as:\n\nConfidence Interval = p \u00b1 (Z * sqrt(p * (1-p) / n))\n\nwhere p is the estimated proportion, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95%), and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the range of values for p such that the probability that the true proportion of undecided voters is between 60% and 68% is at least 95%.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval:\n\nZ = 1.96\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * sqrt(p * (1-p) / n)\n\nWe don't have the exact value of n, but we can use the information given in the problem to estimate it. The survey showed that 256 out of 400 voters were undecided, so the proportion of undecided voters is:\n\np = 256 / 400 = 0.64\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * sqrt(0.64 * (1-0.64) / 400) \u2248 0.0192\n\nSince we want the probability that the true proportion of undecided voters is between 60% and 68% to be at least 95%, we need to find the range of values for p that satisfies this condition.\n\nLower Bound = p - Margin of Error = 0.64 - 0.0192 = 0.6208\nUpper Bound = p + Margin of Error = 0.64 + 0.0192 = 0.6592\n\nSo, we can be 95% sure that the true proportion of undecided voters is between 60% and 68% if the true proportion is between 0.6208 and 0.6592.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this range. Therefore, we cannot be sure that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided at that time.",
