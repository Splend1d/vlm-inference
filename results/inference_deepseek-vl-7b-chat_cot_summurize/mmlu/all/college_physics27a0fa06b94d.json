            "content": "This problem is related to the concept of relative speed and length contraction in special relativity. The observer on Earth measures the length of the meterstick on one spaceship to be 60 cm, but the spaceship occupant measures the same meterstick to be 1 meter. This difference in length is due to the relative motion of the spaceships.\n\nLet's denote the speed of the spaceship with the meterstick as 1m/s as the speed of the spaceship without the meterstick. The speed of the spaceship with the meterstick is the sum of the speed of the spaceship without the meterstick and the speed of the meterstick, which is 1m/s + 1m/s = 2m/s.\n\nNow, let's denote the speed of the spaceship with the meterstick as v. The speed of the spaceship without the meterstick is (v/2) because the observer on Earth measures the speed of the spaceship with the meterstick to be twice the speed of the spaceship without the meterstick.\n\nSo, v/2 = 2m/s.\n\nSolving for v, we get v = 4m/s.\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is 4m/s, which is 4 times the speed of light (4c). So, the correct answer is A. 0.4c.",
