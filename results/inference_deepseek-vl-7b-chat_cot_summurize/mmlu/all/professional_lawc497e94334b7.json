Congress has given lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in all cases except for disputes involving a state as a party. This means that lower federal courts can hear cases involving a state as a party, but the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction over these cases.\n\nA. ambassadors: The Supreme Court does have original jurisdiction over cases involving ambassadors, as well as other federal officials and employees.\nB. public ministers and consuls: The Supreme Court also has original jurisdiction over cases involving public ministers and consuls.\nC. different states: The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving different states, as well as disputes between states and the federal government.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. a state as a party.",
