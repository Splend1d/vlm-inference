Barbara neglected to record the deed, and three years later, Alice conveyed the same property to Charlene who immediately filed the deed she received from Alice. Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for\n\nA. Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.\nB. Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.\nC. Barbara, because she was the first to record her deed.\nD. Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.\n",

            "content": "The jurisdiction's race-notice statute requires that a notice of the prior conveyance be recorded in the land records within a certain time period after the conveyance. The tract index system is a system used to keep track of the land records.\n\nSince Charlene filed the deed she received from Alice immediately after the conveyance, she would have been aware of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara. Therefore, she would have been required to record a notice of the prior conveyance in the land records.\n\nSince Charlene did not record a notice of the prior conveyance, she would not be entitled to the property. Therefore, the likely outcome would be for Barbara, since she was the first to record her deed.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
