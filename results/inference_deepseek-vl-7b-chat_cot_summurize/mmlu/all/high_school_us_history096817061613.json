It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\n\nA.

            "content": "The question is asking you to compare the practice of maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico to one of the options provided. To answer this question, you need to understand the context of maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico and then compare it to the practices of the other options.\n\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is a practice that involves growing and harvesting maize, which is a staple food for many indigenous communities in Mexico. This practice is deeply rooted in their culture and way of life, and it has been passed down through generations.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the other options:\n\nA. Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux: This is a hunting practice that involves hunting buffalo for food and other purposes. While it is a part of the Lakota Sioux culture, it is not directly related to agriculture or food production.\n\nB. Wolf domestication by the Algonquians: This is a practice of domesticating wolves for various purposes, such as hunting and protection. While it is a part of the Algonquian culture, it is not directly related to agriculture or food production.\n\nC. Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois: This is a practice of growing a variety of crops and raising livestock for food and other purposes. While it is a part of the Iroquois culture, it is not directly related to agriculture or food production in the same way as maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico.\n\nD. Seal hunting among the Inuit: This is a hunting practice that involves hunting seals for food and other purposes. While it is a part of the Inuit culture, it is not directly related to agriculture or food production.\n\nBased on this analysis, the practice of maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to the practice of mixed agriculture among the Iroquois. Both practices involve growing a variety of crops and raising livestock for food and other purposes, and they are deeply rooted in the cultures of the indigenous peoples who practice them.",
