The issuance of this certificate is understood to be purely gratuitous. \"Upon receipt of the certificate, the employee designated his wife as beneficiary, signed it, and returned the form to the hotel. One year later, while still employed by the hotel, the employee died. In an action by the employee's widow against the hotel to recover the sum of $5,000, which of the following, if established, is the strongest argument against enforcement of the certificate agreement?\n\nA. The widow was unaware of the certificate agreement until after the employee died.\nB. There was no privity of contract between the widow and the hotel.\nC. The widowin no way relied on the hotel's promise to pay the $5,000.\nD. There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n",

            "content": "The strongest argument against enforcement of the certificate agreement would be that there was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement. \n\nConsideration is a legal term that refers to the value received by one party in a contract from the other party. In this case, the employee received the certificate as a token of appreciation from the hotel, but there is no indication that the hotel received anything of value in return. Therefore, there may not be sufficient consideration to support the contract.\n\nThe other options do not necessarily disprove the enforceability of the certificate agreement:\n\nA. The widow's lack of awareness of the certificate agreement does not necessarily mean that the agreement is not enforceable. The employee could have been aware of the agreement and still chosen to designate his wife as the beneficiary.\n\nB. The lack of privity of contract between the widow and the hotel does not necessarily mean that the agreement is not enforceable. Privity of contract refers to a direct contractual relationship between the parties. In this case, the employee and the hotel had a contract, and the employee's wife is a third party beneficiary of that contract.\n\nC. The widow's lack of reliance on the hotel's promise to pay the $5,000 does not necessarily mean that the agreement is not enforceable. The reliance requirement is a legal doctrine that requires a party to a contract to have relied on the promise made by the other party. However, in this case, the employee's designation of his wife as the beneficiary of the certificate is not a promise made by the hotel, but rather a promise made by the employee to his wife. Therefore, the reliance requirement may not apply.",
