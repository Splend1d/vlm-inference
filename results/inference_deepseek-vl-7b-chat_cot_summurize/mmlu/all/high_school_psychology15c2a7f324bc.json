Crystallized intelligence refers to the knowledge and understanding that individuals have acquired and stored over time, such as facts, figures, rules, and theories. This type of intelligence is often tested on game shows like Jeopardy! where players are required to recall and use previously learned information to answer questions.\n\nIQ (option A) refers to a measure of cognitive ability, which is a broader concept that includes both crystallized and fluid intelligence. Fluid intelligence (option C) refers to the ability to solve problems and think abstractly, while crystallized intelligence refers to the ability to use knowledge and experience to solve problems.\n\nGeneral intelligence (option D) is a measure of overall cognitive ability, which is a combination of both fluid and crystallized intelligence. However, the specific type of intelligence being tested on a game show like Jeopardy! is likely to be crystallized intelligence, as it involves recalling previously learned information.",
