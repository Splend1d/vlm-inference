Greene's basis at the beginning of the year is $15,000.\n2. Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000. This loss reduces Greene's basis by $5,000.\n3. Seagull reported $2,000 of municipal bond interest. This interest is not considered a basis adjustment, so it does not affect Greene's basis.\n4. Seagull distributed $6,000 to Greene on November 1. This distribution increases Greene's basis by $6,000.\n\nTo find Greene's basis at the end of the year, we need to add the initial basis and the distribution, and then subtract the loss:\n\nGreene's basis at the end of the year = Initial basis + Distribution - Loss\nGreene's basis at the end of the year = $15,000 + $6,000 - $5,000\nGreene's basis at the end of the year = $20,000 - $5,000\nGreene's basis at the end of the year = $15,000\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. $15,000.",
