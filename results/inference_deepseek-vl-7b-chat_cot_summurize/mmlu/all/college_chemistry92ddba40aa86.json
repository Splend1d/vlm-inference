Na2CO3 (Sodium Bicarbonate)\nThe dissociation constant (Ka) for the dissociation of Na2CO3 in water is 1.3 x 10^-7. The concentration of CO3^2- ions in the solution is 0.1 M.\n\n[CO3^2-] = 0.1 M\n[H+] = [CO3^2-]/Ka = (0.1 M)/(1.3 x 10^-7) = 7.6 x 10^-4 M\n\npH = -log[H+] = -log(7.6 x 10^-4) \u2248 11.3\n\nB. Na3PO4 (Sodium Phosphate)\nThe dissociation constant (Ka) for the dissociation of Na3PO4 in water is 1.8 x 10^-4. The concentration of PO4^3- ions in the solution is 0.1 M.\n\n[PO4^3-] = 0.1 M\n[H+] = [PO4^3-]/Ka = (0.1 M)/(1.8 x 10^-4) = 5.6 x 10^-3 M\n\npH = -log[H+] = -log(5.6 x 10^-3) \u2248 1.8\n\nC. Na2S (Sodium Sulfide)\nThe dissociation constant (Ka) for the dissociation of Na2S in water is 1.3 x 10^-5. The concentration of S2- ions in the solution is 0.1 M.\n\n[S2-] = 0.1 M\n[H+] = [S2-]/Ka = (0.1 M)/(1.3 x 10^-5) = 7.6 x 10^-3 M\n\npH = -log[H+] = -log(7.6 x 10^-3) \u2248 1.8\n\nD. NaCl (Sodium Chloride)\nThe dissociation constant (Ka) for the dissociation of NaCl in water is 4.0 x 10^-14. The concentration of Cl^- ions in the solution is 0.1 M.\n\n[Cl-] = 0.1 M\n[H+] = [Cl-]/Ka = (0.1 M)/(4.0 x 10^-14) = 2.5 x 10^-4 M\n\npH = -log[H+] = -log(2.5 x 10^-4) \u2248 11.3\n\nComparing the pH values, we can see that the solution with the lowest pH is NaCl with a pH of approximately 11.3.",
