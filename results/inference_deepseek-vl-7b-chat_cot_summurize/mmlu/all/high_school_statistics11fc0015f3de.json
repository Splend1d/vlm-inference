The margin of error is calculated as the critical value for a 95% confidence interval, which is 1.96 according to the standard normal distribution table.\n\nNext, we need to find the standard error, which is the square root of the sample size (n) divided by the square root of the sample proportion (p). In this case, n = 500 and p = 0.08.\n\nStandard error = sqrt(n/p) = sqrt(500/0.08) = sqrt(6250/0.08) = sqrt(78125) \u2248 269.2\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of error = critical value * standard error = 1.96 * 269.2 \u2248 533.12\n\nFinally, we can find the midpoint for the 95% confidence interval:\n\nMidpoint = sample proportion + margin of error = 0.08 + 0.0533 \u2248 0.1333\n\nSo, the midpoint for a 95% confidence interval estimate of p is approximately 0.1333, which is closest to option C.",
