The derivative of the sigmoid function with respect to $x$ is not equal to $\\text{Var}(B)$. The derivative of the sigmoid function is $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))$. The variance of a Bernoulli random variable $B$ is $\\text{Var}(B) = P(B=1) - P(B=0) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))$. However, these two expressions are not equal.\n\nStatement 2: Setting the bias parameters in each layer of neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases.\n\nThis statement is True. When the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network are set to 0, the model becomes a linear model. In a linear model, the variance of the predictions increases with the amount of data, while the bias decreases. This is because the predictions of a linear model are linear combinations of the input features, and the variance of the predictions is proportional to the amount of data. The bias of the predictions is inversely proportional to the amount of data, so it decreases as more data is used.",
