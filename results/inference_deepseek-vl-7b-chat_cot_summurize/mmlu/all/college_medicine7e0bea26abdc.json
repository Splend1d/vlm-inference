The speed of sound in the medium affects the actual frequency of the emitted sound, while the distance between the source and the detector affects the perceived frequency due to the Doppler effect. Therefore, you need both variables to calculate the Doppler shift accurately.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. I and III",
