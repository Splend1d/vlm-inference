            "content": "The reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to total deposits. In this case, the bank has $500 in checking deposits and is required to reserve $50. So, the reserve ratio is:\n\nReserve ratio = (Reserves) / (Total deposits)\nReserve ratio = ($50) / ($500)\nReserve ratio = 0.1 or 10 percent\n\nNow, let's calculate the excess reserves. Excess reserves are the difference between the total reserves and the required reserves. In this case, the required reserves are $50, and the total reserves are $500. So, the excess reserves are:\n\nExcess reserves = (Total reserves) - (Required reserves)\nExcess reserves = ($500) - ($50)\nExcess reserves = $450\n\nSo, the bank has $450 in excess reserves. The correct answer is A. 10 percent $450 in excess reserves.",
