            "content": "Let's denote the amount of contaminant remaining after t minutes as C(t). The rate of removal is given by the equation:\n\nRate = k * C(t)\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nWe are given that 20% of the contaminant can be removed during the first minute, so:\n\nC(1) = 0.8 * C(0)\n\nWe are also given that 98% of the contaminant must be removed to make the water safe, so:\n\nC(t) = 0.02 * C(0)\n\nNow we can solve for C(0):\n\nC(0) = C(1) / (0.8) = (0.8 * C(0)) / 0.8 = C(0)\n\nSince C(0) is the initial amount of contaminant, it is a constant value. Now we can find the time t when 98% of the contaminant is removed:\n\nC(t) = 0.02 * C(0)\n\nWe know that C(t) = 0.02 * C(0) when t = 18 minutes:\n\n0.02 * C(0) = 0.02 * C(0)\n\nt = 18 minutes\n\nSo, the decontamination process will take approximately 18 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
