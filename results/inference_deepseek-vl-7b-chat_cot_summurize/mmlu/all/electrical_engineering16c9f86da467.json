The output frequency is given by the formula:\n\nf = (1/2\u03c0) * (1/R)\n\nwhere f is the output frequency, and R is the resistance of the Wien bridge.\n\nIn an operational amplifier (Op-Amp) based Wien bridge oscillator, the feedback factor is the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage. The output voltage is the difference between the two inputs of the Op-Amp, and the input voltage is the difference between the two resistors in the Wien bridge.\n\nThe feedback factor is given by the formula:\n\nFB = V_out / V_in\n\nwhere V_out is the output voltage, and V_in is the input voltage.\n\nSince the output voltage is the difference between the two inputs of the Op-Amp, and the input voltage is the difference between the two resistors in the Wien bridge, the feedback factor is simply 1.",
