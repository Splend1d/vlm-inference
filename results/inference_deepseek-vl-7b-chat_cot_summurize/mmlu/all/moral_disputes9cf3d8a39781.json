He also suggests that it could lead to the effects of engineering children to have positional goods (B), which could potentially undermine equality of opportunity (C). Therefore, it seems that Singer thinks all of these social problems are serious, but the least serious might be the loss of equality of opportunity, as it is less directly related to the negative consequences of a genetic supermarket than the other options.",
