An integral domain with characteristic 0 is a commutative ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. This property implies that the ring is isomorphic to the set of integers, which is infinite.\n\nStatement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\nThis statement is false. An integral domain with a prime characteristic (i.e., a characteristic that is a prime number) is a finite ring. This is because a finite ring has a finite number of elements, and a prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. Therefore, a finite ring with a prime characteristic must have a finite number of elements.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. False, True.",
