            "content": "Late one afternoon, a woman was hitchhiking when she was picked up by a man. Shortly thereafter, the man stopped and parked his car in a roadside rest area. They were smoking marijuana when another car skidded and crashed into the man's car. The collision damaged the man's car and inflicted personal injuries upon him. The woman was likewise injured. In fact, the impact produced a state of unconsciousness in her that lasted several minutes. The woman sued the other driver seeking to recover for his alleged negligence. At trial, the woman testified to her injuries and to the other driver's negligence. In defense, the other driver called an attorney who lived next door to the woman. The attorney proposed to testify that after the accident, the woman consulted him about her claim and asked the attorney in confidence how she could falsely testify that she wasn't smoking marijuana at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the woman's attorney, the attorney's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as a statement against interest.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the woman's privilege against self-incrimination.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the attorney-client privilege for confidentialcommunications.\n",

            "content": "The attorney's testimony is inadmissible because it violates the attorney-client privilege for confidential communications. The attorney-client privilege is a legal doctrine that protects communications between an attorney and their client from being disclosed to third parties without the client's consent. This privilege is intended to encourage open and honest communication between attorney and client, which is essential for the effective functioning of the legal system.\n\nIn this case, the attorney's proposed testimony would reveal confidential communications between the woman and her attorney, which could potentially undermine the woman's credibility as a witness. The woman's attorney objected to this testimony on the grounds that it violates the attorney-client privilege, and the court agreed. Therefore, the attorney's testimony is inadmissible.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. inadmissible, because it violates the attorney-client privilege for confidentialcommunications.",
