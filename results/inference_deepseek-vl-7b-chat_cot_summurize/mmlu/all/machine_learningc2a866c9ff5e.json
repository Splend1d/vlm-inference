However, the matrices they work on are different. PCA works on the covariance matrix of the data, while Spectral Clustering works on the Laplacian matrix of the data. Both matrices have the same size, as they are derived from the same data set.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, not to estimate a continuous value. Linear regression, on the other hand, is a regression algorithm that estimates the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.",
