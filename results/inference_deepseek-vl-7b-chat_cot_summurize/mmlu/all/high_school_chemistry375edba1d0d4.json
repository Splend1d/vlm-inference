The work done can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nW = -T * (L / (T + L))\n\nwhere W is the work done.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the entropy change:\n\n\u0394S = (8.314 J mol-1 K-1 * 43.9 kJ mol-1 * T) / (-T * (43.9 kJ mol-1 / (T + 43.9 kJ mol-1)))\n\n\u0394S = (8.314 * 43.9 * T) / (-T * (43.9 / (T + 43.9)))\n\n\u0394S = (361.924 T) / (-T * (43.9 / (T + 43.9)))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n\u0394S = (361.924 T) / (-43.9 / (T + 43.9))\n\n\u0394S = (361.924 T) * (T + 43.9) / 43.9\n\n\u0394S = 361.924 T^2 + 361.924 T\n\nNow, we can plug in the given molar heat of vaporization:\n\n\u0394S = 361.924 * (43.9)^2\n\n\u0394S = 361.924 * 1912.7\n\n\u0394S = 673,000.3 J mol-1 K-1\n\nThe entropy change for the vaporization of water is approximately 673,000.3 J mol-1 K-1, which corresponds to option D.",
