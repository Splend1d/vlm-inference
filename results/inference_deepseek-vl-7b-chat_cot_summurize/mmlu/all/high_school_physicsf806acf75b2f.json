Which of the following describes a correct and practical method of measuring the wavelength of the sound wave with a meterstick?\n\nA. Lightly touch the guitar string in the middle such that a single node is created. Measure the length of the string; this is the wavelength.\nB. Measure the length of the guitar string; this is half the wavelength.\nC. Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.\nD. Measure the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes; this is the wavelength.\n",
