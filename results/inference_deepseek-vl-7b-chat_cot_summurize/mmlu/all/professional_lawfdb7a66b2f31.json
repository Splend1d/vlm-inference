The statute in question infringes on this authority by requiring the President to receive congressional approval for joint military exercises with foreign forces. This could potentially hinder the President's ability to respond quickly to foreign threats, as it would require additional time to obtain congressional approval. Therefore, this statute is likely unconstitutional because it encroaches on the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief.",
