Kale is a nutrient-dense vegetable, and it contains approximately 95 calories per 100 grams (source: USDA National Nutrient Database).\n\nAssuming a person consumes 2000 calories per day (which is a common daily calorie intake for an adult), we can calculate the annual calorie requirement as follows:\n\n2000 calories/day * 365 days/year = 730,000 calories/year\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of kale needed:\n\n730,000 calories/year / 95 calories/100 grams = 7,700 kg/year\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nA. 2*10^3 kg/yr",
