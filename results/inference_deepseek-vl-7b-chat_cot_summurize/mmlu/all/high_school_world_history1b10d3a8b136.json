Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\nC. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\nD.

            "content": "The passage provided by Walter Rodney discusses the impact of the imperialist system on African underdevelopment. It mentions that the operation of this system led to the draining of African wealth and made it impossible for the continent to develop its resources more rapidly. The passage also points out that the capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\n\nGiven this context, the question asks which of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.\n\nOption A suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs. This option aligns with the passage's discussion of the imperialist system's impact on African underdevelopment, as it implies that Europeans were able to control and manipulate the resources of Africa, including foodstuffs, to their advantage.\n\nOption B suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms. While this option does mention trading with Europeans, it does not directly address the impact of European imperialism on African underdevelopment.\n\nOption C suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. While this option does mention trading with Europeans, it does not directly address the impact of European imperialism on African underdevelopment.\n\nOption D suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. This option does not align with the passage's discussion of the imperialist system's impact on African underdevelopment, as it does not mention the role of Europeans in this process.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage and the options given, the best answer is option A, as it directly addresses the impact of European imperialism on African underdevelopment by suggesting that Europeans controlled and manipulated the resources of Africa, including foodstuffs, to their advantage.",
