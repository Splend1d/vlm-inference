This can cause pain for both men and women.\n\nA. infections can cause pain during sexual intercourse, but it is more likely to cause pain for women, as men usually have a shorter urethra which is less prone to infections.\n\nB. foreskin too tight is more likely to cause pain for men, as it can cause discomfort during sexual intercourse. However, it can also cause pain for women if the foreskin is too tight and it rubs against the vagina during intercourse.",
