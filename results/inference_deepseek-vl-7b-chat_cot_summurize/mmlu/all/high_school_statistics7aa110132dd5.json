The newspaper poll is a sample of the population, while the vote is a sample of the eligible voters. The difference could be due to nonresponse bias, where some people who would have voted against the annexation did not respond to the newspaper poll, or due to the fact that not all eligible voters voted in the actual vote. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine which of these reasons is the cause of the difference.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options best describes the difference in the percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the vote itself.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{None of the above}}$.",
