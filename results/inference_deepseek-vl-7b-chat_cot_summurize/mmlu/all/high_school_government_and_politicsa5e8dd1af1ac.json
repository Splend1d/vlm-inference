            "content": "A president usually experiences a reduction in political power when different parties control Congress and the White House (Option C). This is because when the opposition party controls both houses of Congress, they can pass legislation that the president is unable to veto, effectively limiting the president's power. Additionally, when the president's party does not control Congress, it can make it difficult for the president to pass their agenda and can lead to a lack of support for the president's policies.\n\nWhile the number and severity of international crises (Option II) can impact a president's political power, it is not a direct cause of a reduction in power. The severity of international crises can lead to a president being seen as weak or ineffective, but it does not necessarily result in a reduction in power.\n\nThe economy being strong and the president's approval ratings being high (Option IV) can actually increase a president's political power. A strong economy and high approval ratings can lead to increased support for the president's policies and can make it easier for the president to pass their agenda.\n\nThe president being in the final two years of his or her second term (Option I) can also lead to a reduction in political power, but it is not the only circumstance that can result in a reduction in power. A president in the final two years of their term may have less time to implement their policies and may face increased scrutiny from the opposition party.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. I and III only.",
