This means that the total number of marbles must be divisible by the number of groups. The only option that satisfies this condition is option A, where there are 6 groups of marbles with 8 marbles in each group.\n\nOption B, C, and D do not satisfy the condition because they either have more or fewer groups than the total number of marbles. For example, option B has 7 groups, which is not enough to accommodate 56 marbles, and option C has 8 groups, which is more than the total number of marbles. Option D has 9 groups, which is more than the total number of marbles.",
