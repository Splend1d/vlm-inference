We do this by taking the derivative of the function with respect to x and setting it equal to 0.\n\ny' = (1/x^2) - (ln x) / x^2\n\nNow, we set y' = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = (1/x^2) - (ln x) / x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2:\n\n0 = 1 - ln x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nln x = 1\nx = e^1\nx = e\n\nSo, the relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x is e.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
