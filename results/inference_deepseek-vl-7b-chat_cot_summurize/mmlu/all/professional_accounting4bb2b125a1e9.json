Since the market price is higher than the strike price, the warrant has intrinsic value.\n\nIntrinsic value is the difference between the market price and the strike price of the warrant. In this case, the intrinsic value is:\n\n$30 - $20 = $10\n\nTherefore, the theoretical value of the warrant is $10.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $10.00",
