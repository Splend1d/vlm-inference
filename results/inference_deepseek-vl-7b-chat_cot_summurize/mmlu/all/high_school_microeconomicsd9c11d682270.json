At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?\n\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nC. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nD.

            "content": "To maximize utility, we need to find the optimal consumption of apples and oranges that gives the highest total utility. Let's denote the number of apples as A and the number of oranges as O.\n\nThe total utility (U) can be represented as:\n\nU = 12A + 18O\n\nSince Melanie has already spent all of her lunch money, she has no more money to spend on either apples or oranges. Therefore, the marginal utility per dollar for both fruits should be equal. We can find this by taking the derivative of the total utility with respect to A and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndU/dA = 12\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal number of apples (A) and oranges (O) that maximize the total utility. To do this, we can use the constraint that the marginal utility per dollar is equal:\n\n12A = 18O\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n2A = O\n\nNow, we can find the optimal number of apples and oranges:\n\nA = 2\nO = 2\n\nSo, Melanie should make no changes to her consumption. She is already consuming the utility-maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility-maximizing combination of apples and oranges.",
