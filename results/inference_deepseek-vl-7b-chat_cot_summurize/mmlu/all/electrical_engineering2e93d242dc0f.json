Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDuty cycle = (150 V / 110 V) - 1\nDuty cycle = 1.35 - 1\nDuty cycle = 0.35\n\nSo, the value of the duty cycle is 0.35, which is closest to option A. However, since the options are not in order of increasing duty cycle, we cannot determine the exact answer from the given options.",
