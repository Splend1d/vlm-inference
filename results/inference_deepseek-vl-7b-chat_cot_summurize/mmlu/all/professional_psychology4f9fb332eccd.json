            "content": "The Buckley Amendment is a federal law in the United States that addresses the rights of students with disabilities in public schools. It is not an amendment to the Constitution, but rather a statute passed by Congress. The Buckley Amendment is also known as the \"Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\" (IDEA).\n\nThe main purpose of the Buckley Amendment is to ensure that students with disabilities receive a \"free appropriate public education\" (FAPE) that meets their unique needs. This includes providing special education and related services to eligible students with disabilities.\n\nThe Buckley Amendment does not directly address the rights of parents or legal guardians of a child to inspect the child's school records, so option A is not correct.\n\nThe Buckley Amendment does not specifically address the right of patients to have access to their own hospital records, so option B is not correct.\n\nThe Buckley Amendment does not require employers to make reasonable modifications to tests for applicants with disabilities, so option C is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the requirement for schools to provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d to students with disabilities.",
