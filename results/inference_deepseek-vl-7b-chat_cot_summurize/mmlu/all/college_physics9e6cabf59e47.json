            "content": "The energy of the photon is equal to the total energy of the electron and positron after the interaction. The total energy of the electron-positron pair is equal to the rest mass energy of the electron (mc^2) plus the kinetic energy of the two electrons. Since the two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon, they have equal kinetic energy. Therefore, the total energy of the electron-positron pair is equal to the rest mass energy of the electron (mc^2) plus the kinetic energy of one electron (which is half of the total kinetic energy of the two electrons).\n\nSo, the energy of the photon is equal to mc^2 + (1/2) * (2mc^2) = mc^2 + mc^2 = 2mc^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2mc^2.",
