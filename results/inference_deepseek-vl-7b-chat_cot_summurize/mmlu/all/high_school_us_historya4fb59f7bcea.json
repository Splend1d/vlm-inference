During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nA sympathetic reader of Logan's Address in the early years of the United States would be most likely to support which of the following Indian policies?\n\nA.

The address reflects Logan's personal experiences and feelings towards the white settlers, particularly Colonel Cresap's actions that led to the death of Logan's family. Logan's address does not explicitly mention any of the options provided as potential policies to support. However, based on the context and the emotions expressed in the address, it can be inferred that Logan would likely support policies that respect Indian territory and sovereignty, as he emphasizes his love for the whites and his advocacy for peace. He also mentions that he never felt fear and would not turn on his heel to save his life, indicating a strong sense of self-determination and independence. Therefore, the most likely policy that Logan would support, based on the information provided, is option B: Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty.",
