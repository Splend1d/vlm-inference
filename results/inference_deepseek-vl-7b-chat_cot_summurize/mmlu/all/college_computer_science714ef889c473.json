            "content": "To find the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes L, we need to consider the number of 0's and 1's in the strings in L. Since the number of 0's is divisible by k and the number of 1's is odd, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The number of 0's is divisible by k.\nIn this case, the number of 1's is odd, so there must be an odd number of 1's. Since the number of 0's is divisible by k, there must be an odd number of 0's as well. Therefore, the number of 0's and 1's must be odd, which means there must be an odd number of states in the DFA.\n\nCase 2: The number of 0's is not divisible by k.\nIn this case, the number of 1's is odd, so there must be an odd number of 1's. Since the number of 0's is not divisible by k, there must be an even number of 0's. Therefore, the number of 0's and 1's must be even, which means there must be an even number of states in the DFA.\n\nSince there are two cases, we need to consider both cases to find the minimum number of states. In the worst-case scenario, we need to consider the maximum number of states for each case. In Case 1, we need at least 1 state (for the odd number of 1's), and in Case 2, we need at least 2 states (for the even number of 0's). Therefore, the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes L is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2k",
