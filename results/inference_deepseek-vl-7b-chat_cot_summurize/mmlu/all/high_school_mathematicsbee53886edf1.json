            "content": "The problem is asking for the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition 4 into 2 non-empty partitions.\n\nUsing the stars and bars method, we can represent the partitions as follows:\n\n* * * *\n* * *\n* *\n*\n\nThere are 4 stars (representing the 4 balls) and 3 bars (representing the 3 divisions between the balls and the boxes). So, the number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to arrange these 4 stars and 3 bars, which is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(n + k - 1, 3)\n\nwhere n is the number of balls (4) and k is the number of boxes (2).\n\nC(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6 - 3)!) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 ways to distribute the 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 8",
