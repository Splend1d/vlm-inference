While enjoying these land allotments, the peasants are obliged, in return, to fulfill obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this status, which is temporary, the peasants are temporarily bound. . . .\n[T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the nobles, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use.

            "content": "The long-term effects of Tsar Alexander II's emancipation, as described in the text, were not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the emancipation was not without its challenges. The text mentions that the peasants were granted the right to purchase their household plots and could acquire full ownership of the arable lands and other properties allotted to them for permanent use. This suggests that the peasants were given the opportunity to become free peasant landowners.\n\nHowever, the text also mentions that peasants and household serfs must be obedient towards their nobles and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations until the organization of cantons and of cantonal courts. This implies that the peasants were still bound by certain obligations to the nobles, which could have limited their freedom and economic opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the text does not mention any significant increase in food production or export of agricultural goods, nor does it mention any significant decline in agricultural output. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that food production soared or that the program was a complete disaster.\n\nThe text also does not mention any significant movement of former serfs to the cities, which could have contributed to the commencement of an industrial revolution in Russia.\n\nBased on the information provided, the best description of the long-term effects of Tsar Alexander II's emancipation is that it was a complex process that granted the peasants the opportunity to become free peasant landowners, but also imposed certain obligations on them that could have limited their freedom and economic opportunities. The text does not provide enough information to determine the specific long-term effects of the emancipation, such as the impact on food production, export of agricultural goods, or the movement of former serfs to the cities.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nC. The emancipation terms relegated former serfs to communal farming, thus keeping them in perpetual poverty, and made wealthy conservatives nervous.",
