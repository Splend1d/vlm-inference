On August 1,2005, Ann sells to Hunter and Willa, a husband and wife, an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by Hunter). The deed to Hunter and Willa reads as follows: \"To Hunger and Willa and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to Hunter and Brandon, his brother, for $125,000 (Hunter pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and Brandon pays the balance). The deed to Hunter and Brandon provides: \"To Hunter and Brandon and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"On August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and as a consequence, the order of their deaths cannot be established by proof. Hunter's will and Willa's will devise whatever interest in the land in question that is subject to disposition by their wills to their son. Thus, the son owns\n\nA. an undivided one-third interest in the land.\nB. an undivided one-quarter interest in the land.\nC. an undivided one-half interest in the land.\nD. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking for the interest that the son would own in the land after the deaths of Hunter, Willa, and Brandon. \n\nFrom the information given, we know that Ann sold an undivided one-half interest in the land to Hunter and Willa, and then Ann sold her remaining interest to Hunter and Brandon. \n\nThe deed to Hunter and Willa reads \"as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common.\" This means that they own the land as a married couple, with equal rights to the property. \n\nThe deed to Hunter and Brandon reads \"as joint tenants and not as tenants in common.\" This means that they own the land as co-owners, with equal rights to the property. \n\nSince Hunter and Willa owned the land as tenants by the entirety, their interest in the land would pass to their son under their wills. \n\nSince Hunter and Brandon owned the land as joint tenants, their interest in the land would also pass to their son under their wills. \n\nTherefore, the son would own an undivided one-half interest in the land, as he would inherit the interests of both Hunter and Willa, and Hunter and Brandon.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. an undivided one-half interest in the land.",
