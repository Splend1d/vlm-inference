Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?\n\nA. 1%\nB. 10%\nC. 40%\nD. 90%\n",

In this case, the investigators want to detect a difference between Drug X and the standard therapy with a probability of 1%. Therefore, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is 1%, which corresponds to option A.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not match the probability set by the investigators for detecting a difference between the two therapies. \n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
