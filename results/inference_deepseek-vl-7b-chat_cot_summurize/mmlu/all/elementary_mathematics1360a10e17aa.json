He read a 200-page book in 10 hours, so his rate is 200 pages / 10 hours = 20 pages per hour.\n\nNow, let's use this rate to find how long it will take him to read a 320-page book.\n\ntime = 320 pages / 20 pages per hour = 16 hours\n\nSo, it will take Jerry 16 hours to read a 320-page book.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 16 hours.",
