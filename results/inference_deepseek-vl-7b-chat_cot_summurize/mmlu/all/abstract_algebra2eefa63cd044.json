An integer polynomial with integer coefficients is said to be irreducible over Z if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. The polynomial 4x - 2 has no integer roots, so it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nStatement 2: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.\nThis statement is also true. A polynomial with rational coefficients is said to be irreducible over Q if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients. The polynomial 4x - 2 has no rational roots, so it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.
