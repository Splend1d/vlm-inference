            "content": "The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the probability that a photon will be detected when it enters the detector. If the quantum efficiency is 0.1, then the probability that a photon will be detected is 0.1.\n\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times. This is because the probability of a photon being detected is 0.1, and since there are 100 photons, the expected number of photons detected is 100 * 0.1 = 10.\n\nThe rms deviation is a measure of the variability or spread of the data. In this case, the rms deviation will be about 3. This is because the probability of a photon being detected is 0.1, and since there are 100 photons, the expected number of photons detected is 100 * 0.1 = 10. The rms deviation is the square root of the average squared deviation from the mean, which is 10^2 / 10 = 10.\n\nSo, the answer is B. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
