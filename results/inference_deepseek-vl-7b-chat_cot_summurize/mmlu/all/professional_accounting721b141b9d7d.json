During the month of April 10000 units were started and 9000 completed units were transferred. The ending work-in-process inventory was complete as to materials and 50% complete as to conversion. The cost of direct materials was $114000 and the cost of direct labor amounted to $38000. Manufacturing overhead is assigned at the rate of 50% of direct materials. For the purpose of determining the cost of goods manufactured in April what is the cost per equivalent whole unit?\n\nA. $23.22\nB. $21.40\nC. $20.90\nD. 15.4\n",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of goods manufactured in April and then divide it by the number of units produced.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\nStarting work-in-process inventory: 0 units\nUnits started in April: 10000\nUnits completed and transferred: 9000\nEnding work-in-process inventory: 0 units (complete as to materials and 50% complete as to conversion)\nCost of direct materials: $114000\nCost of direct labor: $38000\nManufacturing overhead rate: 50% of direct materials\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the completed units transferred:\n\nCost of direct materials for completed units = 9000 units * $114000/10000 units = $102600\nCost of direct labor for completed units = 9000 units * $38000/10000 units = $34200\n\nNow, let's calculate the manufacturing overhead for the completed units:\n\nManufacturing overhead for completed units = 50% of direct materials for completed units = 0.5 * $102600 = $51300\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the completed units:\n\nTotal cost of completed units = Cost of direct materials for completed units + Cost of direct labor for completed units + Manufacturing overhead for completed units = $102600 + $34200 + $51300 = $188100\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost per equivalent whole unit:\n\nCost per equivalent whole unit = Total cost of completed units / Number of completed units = $188100 / 9000 = $20.90\n\nSo, the cost per equivalent whole unit is $20.90, which corresponds to option C.",
