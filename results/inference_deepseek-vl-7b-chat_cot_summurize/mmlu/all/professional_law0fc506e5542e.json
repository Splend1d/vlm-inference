The woman then drove through a red light and struck a police car driven by a police officer, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's presentation of evidence, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery. The motion for summary judgment should be\n\nA. granted, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.\nB. granted, because the police officer assumed the risk of injury by answering the emergency call.\nC. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.\nD. denied, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n",

            "content": "The \"firefighter's rule\" is a legal principle that states that an emergency responder who is called to an emergency scene is deemed to have assumed the risk of injury that may occur while responding to the emergency. This rule is based on the idea that emergency responders are trained and expected to handle dangerous situations, and therefore, they are not entitled to compensation for injuries sustained while performing their duties.\n\nIn this case, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery.\n\nThe motion for summary judgment should be denied because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job. The \"firefighter's rule\" does not apply to police officers, as they are not emergency responders trained to handle dangerous situations. Instead, police officers are expected to respond to emergencies and handle dangerous situations as part of their job duties. Therefore, the police officer's injury was not a result of an emergency responder's assumption of risk, and the woman should not be barred from recovery under the \"firefighter's rule.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.",
