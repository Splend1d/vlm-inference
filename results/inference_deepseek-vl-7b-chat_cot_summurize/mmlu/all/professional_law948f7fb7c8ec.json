            "content": "A housing corporation owned a tract of land and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the tract of land. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. \"A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\nC. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\nD. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n",

            "content": "The best argument for the landscaper would be that there is no privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association. This means that the landscaper is not directly bound by the terms of the Declaration of Covenants, as he did not enter into a contract with the community association. The gardener, who sold the land to the landscaper, is the one who would be responsible for paying the annual assessment, not the landscaper. Therefore, the landscaper should not be held liable for the payment of the annual assessment for lot 29.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.",
