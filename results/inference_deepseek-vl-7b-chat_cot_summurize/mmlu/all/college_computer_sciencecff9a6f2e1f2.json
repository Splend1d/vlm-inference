This is the time it takes for the network protocol to execute.\n\nThe network has the capacity to carry 1,000 packets per second. This is the maximum number of packets the network can handle in one second.\n\nTo find the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, we need to divide the network's capacity by the time it takes to send one packet.\n\nMaximum rate = Network capacity / Time to send one packet\nMaximum rate = 1,000 packets/second / 10 milliseconds\nMaximum rate = 100,000 bytes/second\n\nSo, the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is approximately 100,000 bytes/second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 100,000 bytes/second.",
