He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n",

No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nIn a \"lien theory\" state, a mortgage lien does not automatically extinguish the joint tenancy. Instead, the mortgage lien attaches to the property, but the joint tenancy continues to exist. When one joint tenant dies, the property passes to the surviving joint tenant by operation of law, without the need for a deed of trust or other legal instrument. Therefore, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage lien because it does not have legal title to the property.",
