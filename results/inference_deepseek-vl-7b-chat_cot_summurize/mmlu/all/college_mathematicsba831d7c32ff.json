We can do this by finding the probability that one integer is a square of the other and subtracting it from 1.\n\nThere are 10 integers from 1 to 10, so there are 10 pairs of integers. Out of these 10 pairs, there are 5 pairs where one integer is a square of the other: (1, 1), (4, 16), (9, 1), (2, 4), and (3, 9).\n\nNow, let's find the probability that one integer is a square of the other. There are 5 pairs where one integer is a square of the other, so the probability that one integer is a square of the other is 5/10 = 0.5.\n\nFinally, we subtract the probability that one integer is a square of the other from 1 to find the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other: 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n\nSo, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is 0.5, which is not listed in the options provided.",
