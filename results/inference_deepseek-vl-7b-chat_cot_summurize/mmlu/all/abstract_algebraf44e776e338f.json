Divide the polynomial by the smallest positive integer that is relatively prime to 5, which is 1.\n   x^4 + 4 \u2261 0 (mod 1)\n\n2. Perform the Euclidean algorithm:\n   - Divide x^4 + 4 by 1:\n     x^3 \u2261 0 (mod 1)\n\n3. Now, we have x^3 \u2261 0 (mod 1). Since x^3 is a multiple of 1, it is also a multiple of 1. Therefore, x^3 \u2261 1 (mod 1).\n\n4. Now, we need to find the inverse of x^3 (mod 5). Since x^3 \u2261 1 (mod 1), the inverse of x^3 is x^(-3) (mod 5).\n\n5.

Since x^(-3) * x^3 is a multiple of 1, it is also a multiple of 1. Therefore, x^(-3) * x^3 \u2261 1 (mod 1).\n\n7. Now, we need to find the inverse of x^(-3) (mod 5). Since x^(-3) * x^3 \u2261 1 (mod 1), the inverse of x^(-3) is x^(-3) (mod 5).\n\n8. Multiply x^(-3) by x^(-3):\n   x^(-6) \u2261 1 (mod 5)\n\n9. Now, we have x^(-6) \u2261 1 (mod 5). Since x^(-6) is a multiple of 1, it is also a multiple of 1. Therefore, x^(-6) \u2261 1 (mod 1).\n\n10. Now, we need to find the inverse of x^(-6) (mod 5). Since x^(-6) \u2261 1 (mod 1), the inverse of x^(-6) is x^(-6) (mod 5).\n\n11. Multiply x^(-6) by x^(-6):\n   x^(-12) \u2261 1 (mod 5)\n\n12. Now, we have x^(-12) \u2261 1 (mod 5). Since x^(-12) is a multiple of 1, it is also a multiple of 1. Therefore, x^(-12) \u2261 1 (mod 1).\n\n13. Now, we need to find the inverse of x^(-12) (mod 5). Since x^(-12) \u2261 1 (mod 1), the inverse of x^(-12) is x^(-12) (mod 5).\n\n14. Multiply x^(-12) by x^(-12):\n   x^(-24) \u2261 1 (mod 5)\n\n15. Now, we have x^(-24) \u2261 1 (mod 5). Since x^(-24) is a multiple of 1, it is also a multiple of 1. Therefore, x^(-24) \u2261 1 (mod 1).\n\n16. Now, we need to find the inverse of x^(-24) (mod 5). Since x^(-24) \u2261 1 (mod 1), the inverse of x^(-24) is x^(-24) (mod 5).\n\n17. Multiply x^(-24) by x^(-24):\n   x^(-48) \u2261 1 (mod 5)\n\n18. Now, we have x^(-48) \u2261 1 (mod 5). Since x^(-48) is a multiple of 1, it is also a multiple of 1. Therefore, x^(-48) \u2261 1 (mod 1).\n\n19. Now, we need to find the inverse of x^(-48)",
