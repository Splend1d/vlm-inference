            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces.\n\nThe buoyant force on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. The weight of the fluid is equal to the volume of the fluid that the cube displaces, multiplied by the density of the fluid.\n\nThe volume of the cube is equal to the side length cubed, so the volume of the cube is 0.5 m * 0.5 m * 0.5 m = 0.125 m^3.\n\nThe density of the fluid is 1200 kg/m^3, so the weight of the fluid that the cube displaces is 0.125 m^3 * 1200 kg/m^3 = 150 kg.\n\nTherefore, the buoyant force on the cube is 100 kg (the mass of the cube) + 150 kg (the weight of the displaced fluid) = 250 kg.\n\nThe force that the cube exerts on the fluid is equal to the buoyant force, so the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface of the fluid is equal to the buoyant force divided by the weight of the cube, which is 250 kg / 100 kg = 2.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 2.0/3.",
