In this case, the joint probability of H, U, P, and W is given by:\n\nP(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W) * P(P | W) * P(U | H, P)\n\nThis is because P(U) is given by P(U | H, P) = P(U | H) * P(H | P) = P(U | H) * P(H) * P(P | H) * P(P) = P(U) * P(H) * P(P | H) * P(P), where P(U | H) is the conditional probability of U given H, P(H | P) is the conditional probability of H given P, and P(P | H) is the conditional probability of P given H.\n\nSimilarly, P(W) is given by P(W) = P(W | H, P) = P(W | H) * P(H | P) = P(W | H) * P(H) * P(P | H) * P(P) = P(W) * P(H) * P(P | H) * P(P).\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of H, U, P, and W is given by P(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W) * P(P | W) * P(U | H, P).",
