While preparing her lecture the night before the presentation, Dr. Black decides it would be valuable to demonstrate some of her techniques with the group. She decides that, instead of lecturing for the full four hours, she will have attendees divide into groups for the last two hours to experiment with the techniques. According to ethical standards, this is:\n\nA. ethical if she allows participants to leave after the lecture portion of the seminar.\nB. ethical if the demonstration is well executed and educational.\nC. unethical since she advertised the seminar as a \u201clecture.\u201d\nD. unethical because she plans to spend some of the time lecturing when the most beneficial part will probably be the experiential portion\n",
