Assume that each person listed below as the grantee in a deed paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it. The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions. The owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is\n\nA. the bartender.\nB. the counselor.\nC. the dentist.\nD. the engineer.\n",

The order of recording the deeds is not relevant to the ownership, as the developer is the one who owns the land and can convey it to others.
