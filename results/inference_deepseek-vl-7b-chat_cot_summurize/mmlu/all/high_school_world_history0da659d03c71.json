The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich conclusion is supported by the passage?\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n",

            "content": "The passage provides a detailed account of the slave trade in Algeria during the 1830s, as given by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan. The passage describes the process of capturing and enslaving black Africans, the prices at which they were sold, and the physical and emotional suffering they endured during their capture and enslavement.\n\nOption A, \"Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement,\" is supported by the passage. The passage describes how the soldiers divided themselves into two companies to attack places without defenses and capture the inhabitants, and how the slaves were bought at the slave market without much chance of escaping. This suggests that the slaves were captured and enslaved passively, without much resistance.\n\nOption B, \"North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes,\" is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention any rival African tribes capturing and enslaving North Africans.\n\nOption C, \"Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women,\" is not supported by the passage. The passage does not provide any information about the population changes resulting from slavery in North Africa.\n\nOption D, \"Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength,\" is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention any specific value being placed on adult male slaves due to their physical strength.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion supported by the passage is option A, \"Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\"",
