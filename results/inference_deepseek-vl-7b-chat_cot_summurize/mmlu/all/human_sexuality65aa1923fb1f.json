This is because identical twins share the same DNA and are more likely to have the same genetic factors that influence sexual orientation. In contrast, fraternal twins have only about 50% of their DNA in common, so their concordance rate for homosexuality is lower. Adoptive brothers, while related, do not share the same genetic material as biological brothers, so their concordance rate for homosexuality is also lower.",
