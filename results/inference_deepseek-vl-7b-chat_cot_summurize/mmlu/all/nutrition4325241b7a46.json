Because they respond more rapidly to changes in iron levels in the diet.\nB. Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\nC. Because the specific iron indices can be measured more accurately and easily.\nD. Because haemoglobin levels vary with subject age, and between the sexes.\n",
