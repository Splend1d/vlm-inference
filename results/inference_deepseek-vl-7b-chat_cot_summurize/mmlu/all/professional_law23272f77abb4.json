At that moment, the man suddenly yelled, \"I hereby revoke my offer. \"If the neighbor thereafter mows the man's lawn, will he recover the $50?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\nB. Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\nC. No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\nD. No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation.\n",

Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\n\nIn this case, the man made a clear offer to pay the neighbor $50 if he mowed the lawn. The neighbor accepted the offer by purchasing gasoline for the mower and preparing to mow the lawn. At this point, the man's attempt to revoke the offer is ineffective because the neighbor has already taken steps to prepare to accept the offer. This situation fits the definition of a unilateral contract, where one party makes a promise to perform a certain action in exchange for a promise from the other party to pay a certain amount of money. Since the neighbor has already accepted the offer and has not yet completed performance, the man's revocation is considered irrevocable, and the neighbor should be entitled to the $50.",
