The degree of a polynomial in a ring of polynomials is determined by the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. If we add two polynomials, the degree of the sum is simply the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n\nStatement 2: If F is a field then every ideal of F[x] is principal.\n\nThis statement is also true. In a field, every ideal is principal. This is because in a field, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, which means that every ideal can be generated by a single element.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A.",
