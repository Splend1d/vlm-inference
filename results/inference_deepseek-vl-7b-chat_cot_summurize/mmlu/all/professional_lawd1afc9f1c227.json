            "content": "A nephew brings an action against the administrator of his uncle's estate based upon a contract for services rendered in the management of his uncle's property. In order to rebut the presumption that the services rendered were gratuitous, since the nephew was a relative of his uncle, the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. The sister-in-law testified that she had lived in the nephew's house, knew his uncle, and that she was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney asked her to look at a letter and to tell the court whether it was written by the uncle. Upon objection by the attorney for the administrator of the estate, the trial judge would most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.\nB. sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nC. overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking what the trial judge would most likely do in a situation where a nephew is trying to prove that his uncle's contract for services rendered was not gratuitous, and he calls his sister-in-law as a witness. The sister-in-law is familiar with the uncle's handwriting and can identify the handwriting of the letter in question. The nephew's attorney asks her to testify about the letter, but the attorney for the administrator of the estate objects.\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA. Sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.\nB. Sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nC. Overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.\n\nThe correct answer is D. Overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question. This is because the sister-in-law is familiar with the uncle's handwriting and can identify the handwriting of the letter in question. She is not an expert, but her familiarity with the handwriting is enough to authenticate the letter.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert. This is incorrect because the sister-in-law is not required to be a handwriting expert to authenticate the letter.\n\nB. Sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute. This is incorrect because the Dead Man's Statute does not apply to this situation. The Dead Man's Statute is a legal principle that prevents a person from being able to bring a lawsuit after their death.\n\nC. Overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule. This is incorrect because the sister-in-law is not a past recollection of the letter, but rather a person who can identify the handwriting of the letter.",
