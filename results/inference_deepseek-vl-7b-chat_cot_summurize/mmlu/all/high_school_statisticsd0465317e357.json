            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula to find the number of employees whose income falls between $13,000 and $28,000. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the z-score for, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for $13,000 and $28,000:\n\nz1 = (13000 - 20500) / 3750 = -4.5\nz2 = (28000 - 20500) / 3750 = 2.5\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The z-table gives us the probability that a value is less than or equal to a given z-score.\n\nP(-4.5 \u2264 z \u2264 2.5) = P(z < -4.5) + P(z \u2264 2.5)\n\nUsing the z-table, we find:\n\nP(z < -4.5) \u2248 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
