            "content": "To find the constant speed at which the motor can lift up a 6 kg mass, we need to first find the torque (T) that the motor can produce. Torque is the product of the input voltage (V), input current (I), and the motor's efficiency (\u03b7).\n\nT = V * I * \u03b7\n\nGiven the input voltage (V) is 120V, the input current (I) is 1.0 Amps, and the motor's efficiency (\u03b7) is 75%, we can calculate the torque (T) as follows:\n\nT = 120V * 1.0A * 0.75 = 90 Nm\n\nNow, we need to find the required force (F) to lift up the 6 kg mass. The force is equal to the mass (m) multiplied by the acceleration (a).\n\nF = m * a\n\nGiven the mass (m) is 6 kg, we can calculate the acceleration (a) as follows:\n\na = F / m = 90 Nm / 6 kg = 15 m/s\u00b2\n\nNow, we can find the constant speed (v) at which the motor can lift up the 6 kg mass. The speed is equal to the force (F) divided by the torque (T).\n\nv = F / T = 90 Nm / 90 Nm = 1 m/s\n\nTherefore, the motor can lift up the 6 kg mass at a constant speed of 1 m/s.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 1.0 m/s.",
