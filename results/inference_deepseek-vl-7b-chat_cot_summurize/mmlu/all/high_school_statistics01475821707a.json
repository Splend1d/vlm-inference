The number of heads in three tosses of a coin: This is a binomial model because there are a fixed number of trials (three tosses) and a fixed number of successes (heads).\n\nB. The number of rainy days in a given week: This is also a binomial model because there are a fixed number of trials (seven days in a week) and a fixed number of successes (rainy days).\n\nC. The number of girls in a family of five children: This is not a binomial model because there are not a fixed number of trials (the number of children in the family) and a fixed number of successes (the number of girls). Instead, the number of girls can vary depending on the number of children in the family.\n\nD. The number of students present in a class of 22: This is a binomial model because there are a fixed number of trials (22 students) and a fixed number of successes (students present in the class).\n\nTherefore, the situation in which a binomial model is not an appropriate model to describe the outcome is when the number of successes can vary depending on the number of trials, as in the case of the number of girls in a family of five children.",
