The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\nA. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\nB. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\nC. No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\nD. No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n",

            "content": "A. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n\nUnder the common law, a murderer is generally disqualified from inheriting or benefiting from the property they have acquired through their crime. This is because the act of murder is considered a forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including property rights. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court's decision to strip the man of all ownership rights in the home.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. This option suggests that the man's bigamy (marrying another woman while still being married to his first wife) disqualified him from taking good title to the property. However, bigamy itself does not necessarily disqualify someone from owning property. The issue here is the murder, not the bigamy.\n\nC. This option suggests that the court will recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common. However, as mentioned earlier, the act of murder generally disqualifies a person from inheriting or benefiting from property.\n\nD. This option suggests that there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide. While this is true, it does not address the issue of the murderer's disqualification from owning the property.",
