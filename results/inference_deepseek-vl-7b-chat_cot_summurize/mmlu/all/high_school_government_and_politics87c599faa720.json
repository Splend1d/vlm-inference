            "content": "A. When there is a strong front-runner in a state, people in that state are less likely to vote.\n\nThis statement is true. When a strong front-runner emerges in a state, it can lead to a \"spoiler effect\" where voters may feel that their vote doesn't matter because the outcome is already decided. This can lead to voter apathy and a decrease in voter turnout.\n\nB. White-collar workers are more likely to vote than are blue-collar workers, with the exception of blue-collar workers who belong to unions.\n\nThis statement is true. Generally, white-collar workers have more stable and higher-paying jobs, which can lead to more free time and a greater sense of civic duty. However, blue-collar workers who belong to unions are more likely to vote because unions often encourage and facilitate voting as part of their political activities.\n\nC. Voters who are registered as independent are less likely to vote than those who are registered Democrats or Republicans.\n\nThis statement is true. Independent voters are often seen as \"swing voters\" who can influence the outcome of an election. However, they are less likely to vote because they don't feel as strongly attached to either party.\n\nD. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.\n\nThis statement is false. Studies have shown that people with higher levels of education are more likely to vote. This is likely because they have a greater understanding of the issues and the importance of their vote.",
