The spiral r = ln \u03b8 is a logarithmic spiral, which is a type of spiral that has a constant ratio between consecutive radii.\n\nThe spiral starts at the origin (0, 0) and ends at the point (2\u03c0, ln(2\u03c0)). We can find the area bounded by this spiral by integrating the function r = ln \u03b8 with respect to \u03b8 from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nThe integral of ln \u03b8 with respect to \u03b8 is (1/\u03b8). So, the area bounded by the spiral is:\n\nArea = \u222b(1/\u03b8) d\u03b8 from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0\n\nArea = (1/2\u03c0) * (ln(2\u03c0) - ln(\u03c0))\n\nArea = (1/2\u03c0) * (ln(2) - 0)\n\nArea = (1/2\u03c0) * ln(2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that ln(2) \u2248 0.6931. Therefore, the area bounded by the spiral r = ln \u03b8 on the interval \u03c0 <= \u03b8 <= 2\u03c0 is:\n\nArea \u2248 (1/2\u03c0) * 0.6931 \u2248 0.3465\n\nHowever, this result is not among the given options.
