He thinks that the most significant way in which this might happen is by burdening a patient with having to justify his or her continued existence (Option A). This is because euthanasia involves making a decision about whether or not a person's life is worth living, which can be a difficult and emotionally charged process. It can also lead to feelings of guilt or regret, as the person who is considering euthanasia may feel like they are giving up on their life or not living up to their potential.",
