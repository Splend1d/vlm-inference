The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThe first passage tends to support which of the following traditional historical assumptions?\n\nA. That the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era\nB. That most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory during the crusading era\nC. That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent\nD. That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era\n",

            "content": "The first passage discusses the obligation of jihad and the duty of a Muslim ruler to prosecute it, emphasizing the importance of bringing about the victory of Islam. It also mentions that if a Muslim ruler does not do so and makes peace with the infidel, he would be better dead than alive. This suggests that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era.\n\nThe second passage describes the behavior of Christians towards Muslim hermits and the treatment of Christian merchants in Muslim territories. It does not directly relate to the assumption about the ideology of holy war, but it does show that there was some level of peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians during the crusading era.\n\nTherefore, the first passage tends to support the assumption that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
