This is because subordinates are more familiar with their own work environment and have a better understanding of the tasks and responsibilities they are responsible for. As a result, they are more likely to set goals that are realistic and achievable for them, rather than goals that are set by someone else without their input.\n\nB. Of about the same level of difficulty - This is incorrect because research has shown that subordinates tend to set more challenging goals than those set by their supervisors.\n\nC. Never accomplished - This is incorrect because subordinates are more likely to set goals that are realistic and achievable for them, so they are more likely to accomplish their goals than not.\n\nD.
