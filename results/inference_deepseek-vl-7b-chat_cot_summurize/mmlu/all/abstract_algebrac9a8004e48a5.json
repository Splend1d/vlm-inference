            "content": "Statement 1: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}.\n\nThis statement is true. In ring theory, a homomorphism between rings is a mapping that preserves the operations of the rings. A homomorphism is one-to-one (or injective) if it maps each element of the domain to a unique element of the codomain. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the zero element in the codomain. If a homomorphism is one-to-one, then its kernel is the trivial subgroup containing only the zero element, which is {0}. Conversely, if the kernel of a homomorphism is {0}, then the homomorphism is one-to-one.\n\nStatement 2: Q is an ideal in R.\n\nThis statement is also true. An ideal in a ring R is a subset I of R such that for every r in R and every i in I, the product ri is also in I. In this case, Q is a subset of R, and for every r in R and every i in Q, the product ri is also in Q. Therefore, Q is an ideal in R.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A.",
