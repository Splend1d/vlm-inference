Support vector machines (SVMs) and logistic regression models both provide a probability distribution over the possible labels for a given input example. SVMs use a hyperplane to separate the data into different classes, while logistic regression models use a logistic function to predict the probability of a given class. Both of these models provide a probability distribution over the possible labels.\n\nStatement 2: We would expect the support vectors to remain the same as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nThis statement is false. The support vectors in an SVM are the data points that are closest to the decision boundary. When we change the kernel from a linear kernel to a higher order polynomial kernel, the decision boundary changes, and the support vectors will also change. This is because the higher order polynomial kernel allows for a more complex decision boundary, which can result in different support vectors than the linear kernel.",
