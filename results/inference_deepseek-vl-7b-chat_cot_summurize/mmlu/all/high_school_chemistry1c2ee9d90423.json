NH4Br(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NH4NO3(aq) + Br-(aq).\n\nWhen NH4Br and AgNO3 are mixed, the Br- ions from NH4Br and NO3- ions from AgNO3 react to form NH4NO3 and Br-. The Ag+ ions from AgNO3 do not react with the NH4+ ions from NH4Br, so they remain in the solution as ions. The detailed reaction is as follows:\n\nNH4Br(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NH4NO3(aq) + Br-(aq)\n\nIn this reaction, the NH4+ and NO3- ions from the two solutions react to form NH4NO3, while the Br- ion from NH4Br and the NO3- ion from AgNO3 react to form Br-. The Ag+ ions from AgNO3 do not react with the NH4+ ions from NH4Br, so they remain in the solution as ions.",
