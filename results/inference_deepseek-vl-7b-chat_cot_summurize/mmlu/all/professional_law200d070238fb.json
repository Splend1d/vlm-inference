            "content": "Congress has recently enacted a statute designed to prevent price gouging of gasoline by private retail sellers. To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue \"cease and desist\" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who \"intentionally engaged in price gouging. \" In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?\n\nA. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.\nB. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\nC. Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.\nD. Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\n",

            "content": "The strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency would be that Congress cannot delegate the power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment. This is because the power to issue such orders and the authority to punish violations of those orders are both forms of law enforcement, which are typically reserved to the courts and the U.S. Attorney General, as they are considered part of the judicial and executive branches of government, respectively.\n\nThe other options do not directly challenge the constitutionality of the agency's authority:\n\nA. While it is true that Congress cannot delegate the power to make interpretations of existing federal laws, this does not directly challenge the constitutionality of the agency's authority to issue \"cease and desist\" orders.\n\nB. The agency's authority to issue \"cease and desist\" orders is not unconstitutional, as long as the agency is authorized to do so by Congress. The punishment for violating these orders is also not unconstitutional, as long as it is within the scope of the agency's authority.\n\nC. The argument that Congress cannot delegate enforcement of a federal law to any governmental body other than the U.S. Attorney General or the courts is not directly applicable to this agency, as the agency is not being asked to enforce a federal law, but rather to interpret and apply existing federal law.\n\nD. The argument that Congress cannot retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency is not directly relevant to the constitutionality of the agency's authority. The agency's authority is not dependent on the composition of its membership.",
