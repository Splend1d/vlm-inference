The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that\n\nA. the leasehold contract was void ab initio.\nB. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.\nC. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.\nD. the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.\n",

The student's lease was for three years, but it had expired. However, the student continued to pay rent, and the widow continued to accept it. This means that the lease has become a periodic tenancy, and the widow needs to give the student notice to terminate the tenancy. If she does not give the required notice, the student can argue that the eviction is not valid.",
