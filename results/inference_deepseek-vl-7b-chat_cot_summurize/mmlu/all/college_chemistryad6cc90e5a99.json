            "content": "The magnetogyric ratio (\u03b3) is defined as the gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3) divided by the magnetic moment (\u03bc). The gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3) is the ratio of the magnetic moment of an atom to its nuclear spin (I). The magnetic moment (\u03bc) is the product of the nuclear spin (I) and the nuclear charge (Z).\n\nFor 23Na, the gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3) is 1.41 x 10^7 T-1 s-1, and the nuclear spin (I) is 3/2. The nuclear charge (Z) is 1.\n\nSo, the magnetogyric ratio (\u03b3) / nuclear magnetic moment (\u03bc) = 1.41 x 10^7 T-1 s-1 / (3/2) = 0.9377 x 10^7 T-1 s-1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.9377 x 10^7 T-1 s-1.",
