The GDP deflator is a measure of the general price level of goods and services in the economy, and it is used to adjust nominal GDP for inflation.\n\nGiven nominal GDP (GDP at current prices) equals $6000 and the GDP deflator equals 200, we can calculate real GDP (GDP at constant prices) as follows:\n\nReal GDP = Nominal GDP / (1 + GDP Deflator)\nReal GDP = $6000 / (1 + 200)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of the expression:\n\nReal GDP = $6000 / (1 + 200)\nReal GDP = $6000 / 210\nReal GDP = $28.57\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $3,000.",
