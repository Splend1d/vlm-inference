H2Se > H2S > H2O. \n\nThe strength of a binary acid is determined by the strength of the hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atom of the acid and the oxygen atom of water. The stronger the hydrogen bond, the stronger the acid. \n\nIn the case of H2Se, the hydrogen atom is bonded to a Se atom, which has a stronger electronegative force than that of an O atom. This means that the hydrogen bond in H2Se is stronger than in H2O. \n\nSimilarly, in the case of H2S, the hydrogen atom is bonded to a S atom, which has a stronger electronegative force than that of an O atom. This means that the hydrogen bond in H2S is stronger than in H2O. \n\nHowever, in the case of H2O, the hydrogen atom is bonded to an O atom, which has a weaker electronegative force than that of an O atom. This means that the hydrogen bond in H2O is weaker than in H2S and H2Se. \n\nTherefore, the correct order of the strength of binary acids is H2Se > H2S > H2O.",
