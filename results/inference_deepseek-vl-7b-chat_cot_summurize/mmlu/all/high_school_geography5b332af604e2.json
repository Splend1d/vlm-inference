This occurs because the initial increase in spending or investment leads to an increase in production, which in turn leads to an increase in employment and income, which then leads to further increases in production and employment, and so on. The multiplier effect is often represented as a ratio, with the multiplier itself being a positive number that indicates the degree to which an initial increase in spending or investment leads to a larger overall increase in economic output.",
