The region defined by $x^2+y^2+z^2\\le 1$ is a sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin.\nThe ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cube is equal to the ratio of the probability that a randomly selected point lies on the sphere to the probability that a randomly selected point lies in the cube.\nThe volume of a sphere with radius 1 is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1^3)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\nThe volume of a cube with side length 2 is $2^3=8$.\nTherefore, the ratio of the volumes is $\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi}{8}=\\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected point lies on the sphere is $\\boxed{C}$.\nThe answer is: \\frac{\\pi}{6}",
