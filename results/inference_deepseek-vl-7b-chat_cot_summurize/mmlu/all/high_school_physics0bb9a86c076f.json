            "content": "The electric field strength due to a charge distribution is given by the formula E = \u03c1/\u03b5\u2080, where \u03c1 is the charge density and \u03b5\u2080 is the vacuum permittivity. In this case, the charge density \u03c1 is given by \u03c1 = ar, where a is a positive constant.\n\nTo find the electric field strength, we need to find the value of \u03c1 when r = R. Since a is a positive constant, \u03c1 will also be positive when r > R. Therefore, the electric field strength will be positive when r > R.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. It increases as r approaches infinity.\nThis is not true. The electric field strength will decrease as r approaches infinity, not increase.\n\nB. It decreases linearly for r > R.\nThis is not true. The electric field strength will increase linearly for r > R, not decrease.\n\nC. It increases linearly for r > R.\nThis is true. As r increases, the charge density \u03c1 will also increase linearly, and therefore the electric field strength will increase linearly.\n\nD. It increases non-linearly for r < R.\nThis is not true. The electric field strength will decrease non-linearly for r < R, not increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The electric field strength due to this charge distribution at a distance r from the center increases linearly for r > R.",
