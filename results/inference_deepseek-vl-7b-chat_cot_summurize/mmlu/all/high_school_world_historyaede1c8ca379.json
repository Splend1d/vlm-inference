            "content": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

            "content": "The passage describes the harsh conditions and exploitation of the indigenous people in the quicksilver mines of Huancavelica, Potosi, and other mines in Spanish South America. The mine owners and stewards are portrayed as tyrants who treat the Indians harshly, without fear of God or Justice, and keep them in debt. The Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is hidden. They are also forced to accept food and drink at their own expense, which is deducted from their labor and workdays. The Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, with no way to pay their tribute.\n\nThe passage does not provide evidence for the formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts, the absence of corruption among elites, the king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects, or the imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth.\n\nHowever, the passage does provide evidence for the social stratification based on origin of birth, as it describes the harsh treatment of the indigenous people by the Spanish and mestizo mine owners and stewards. The indigenous people are portrayed as being at the bottom of the social hierarchy, with no power or recourse against the mine owners and stewards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth.",
