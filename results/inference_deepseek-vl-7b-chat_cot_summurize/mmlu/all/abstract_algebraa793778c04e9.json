The unity of a subring is the identity element of the subring, and the unity of the ring is the identity element of the ring. Therefore, they must be the same.\n\nStatement 2: Every field is an integral domain. This statement is also true. A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is always non-zero. Since every field has a multiplicative inverse for every non-zero element, it is an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
