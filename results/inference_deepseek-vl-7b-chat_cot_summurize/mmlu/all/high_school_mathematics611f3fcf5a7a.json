            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, exactly two dice showing an even number)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 4 dice rolled)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 2 dice showing an even number)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of rolling an even number, which is 10/20 or 1/2)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of rolling an odd number, which is 10/20 or 1/2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(4, 2) * (1/2)^2 * (1-1/2)^(4-2)\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 2) = 6 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6/16 = 3/8\n\nSo, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is 3/8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.",
