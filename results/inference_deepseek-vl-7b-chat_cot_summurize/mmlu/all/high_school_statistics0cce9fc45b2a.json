A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables. This is incorrect. A correlation of 1 means that the variables are perfectly correlated, but it does not necessarily indicate a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nC. Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line. This is incorrect. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship, not the degree of clustering around the regression line.\n\nD. Correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data. This is incorrect. Correlation is primarily used with quantitative data, as it measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Categorical data is typically analyzed using other methods, such as chi-square tests or logistic regression.",
