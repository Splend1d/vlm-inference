Highway networks, a type of neural network architecture, were introduced in 2015 by the University of Toronto's Vector Institute. They were developed as an extension of the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture, which was introduced in 2015 by the University of California, San Diego's CVPR workshop. ResNets were designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks, which can lead to poor performance. Highway networks were developed to further improve the performance of ResNets by introducing a mechanism to allow information to flow between layers.\n\nStatement 2: DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets. This statement is false. DenseNets, or Dense Convolutional Networks, are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in 2017 by the University of Toronto's Vector Institute. They are designed to improve the efficiency of deep neural networks by reducing the number of parameters and computations required. In contrast, ResNets are known for their high memory requirements due to the large number of parameters they use. Therefore, DenseNets are generally more memory-efficient than ResNets.",
