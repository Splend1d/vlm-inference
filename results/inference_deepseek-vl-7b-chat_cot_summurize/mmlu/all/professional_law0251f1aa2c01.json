            "content": "A woman belonged to an organization that advocated for the United States to preemptively attack certain foreign countries. The organization usually used leafleting and public speeches to advance this view, but it sometimes engaged in violent demonstrations against the embassies and consuls of those countries. Although the woman had never participated in a violent demonstration, she was criminally prosecuted for being a member of the organization. In her defense, the woman claimed that her association with the organization was protected by the First Amendment. Which of the following would the prosecution need to prove to overcome that defense?\n\nA. The woman joined the organization with the specific intent of furthering its illegal activities.\nB. The woman provided material aid to the organization through the payment of dues before the violent demonstrations.\nC. The woman continued to provide material aid to the organization through the payment of dues after the violent demonstrations.\nD. The woman expressed public support of the organization after the violent demonstrations.\n",

            "content": "The prosecution would need to prove that the woman's association with the organization was not protected by the First Amendment. This means they would need to show that she had a specific intent to further the organization's illegal activities, or that she continued to support the organization after the violent demonstrations, or that she publicly supported the organization after the demonstrations. \n\nOption A is not enough because the prosecution would need to prove that the woman's association with the organization was not protected by the First Amendment, not just that she had a specific intent to further the organization's illegal activities. \n\nOption B is not enough because the prosecution would need to prove that the woman's association with the organization was not protected by the First Amendment, not just that she provided material aid to the organization through the payment of dues. \n\nOption D is not enough because the prosecution would need to prove that the woman's association with the organization was not protected by the First Amendment, not just that she publicly supported the organization after the demonstrations. \n\nTherefore, the prosecution would need to prove that the woman expressed public support of the organization after the violent demonstrations. This would show that she continued to support the organization after the violent demonstrations, which would not be protected by the First Amendment.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
