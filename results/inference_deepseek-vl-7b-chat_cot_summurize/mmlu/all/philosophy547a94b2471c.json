This approach is based on his belief that the meaning of a term is not solely determined by its empirical applications, but also by the mental processes and associations that arise when the term is used or encountered. By considering the psychological causes and effects, Stevenson aims to capture the full range of meanings and connotations that a term can have, beyond its mere empirical applications.",
