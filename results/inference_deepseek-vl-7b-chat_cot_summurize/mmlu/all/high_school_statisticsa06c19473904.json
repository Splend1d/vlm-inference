A scale of \"proper behavior\" is developed. \u03bc1= the \"proper behavior\" rating for children receiving positive rewards, and \u03bc2= the \"proper behavior\" rating for children receiving punishment. If H0: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2= 0, which of the following is the proper statement of HA?\n\nA. HA: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2> 0\nB. HA: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2< 0\nC. HA: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2\u2260 0\nD.

            "content": "The null hypothesis (H0) is that the \"proper behavior\" ratings for children receiving positive rewards (\u03bc1) are equal to the \"proper behavior\" ratings for children receiving punishment (\u03bc2), i.e., \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 = 0. \n\nThe alternative hypothesis (HA) would be a statement that is not consistent with the null hypothesis. In this case, the alternative hypothesis would be a statement that suggests that the \"proper behavior\" ratings for children receiving positive rewards (\u03bc1) are not equal to the \"proper behavior\" ratings for children receiving punishment (\u03bc2). \n\nTherefore, the proper statement of HA would be a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, i.e., \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 \u2260 0. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
