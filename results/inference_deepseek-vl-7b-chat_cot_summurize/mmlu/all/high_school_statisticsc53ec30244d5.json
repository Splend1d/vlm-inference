For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\n\nThis is because the formula given is Selling price = 15.9 \u2013 0.983 (age). This means that for every year the car gets older, the selling price decreases by 0.983 (or approximately $983).\n\nA is incorrect because the formula shows a decrease, not a percentage decrease.\nB is incorrect because the formula does not provide an average selling price.\nC is incorrect because the formula shows a decrease, not a decrease of $1,590.",
