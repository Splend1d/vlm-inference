A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as \"Mr. and Mrs. Testator. \"The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony\n\nA. admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.\nB. admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\nC. inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.\n",

In this case, the clerk had personal knowledge of the testator and his mother's frequent visits to the hotel and the testator's customary practice of signing the hotel register as \"Mr. and Mrs. Testator.\" This evidence is relevant to the claim of the man's paternity and the testator's marital status.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.",
