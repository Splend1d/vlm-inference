According to Lagrange's theorem, in a finite group, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup divides the order of the group. Therefore, if a finite group has order n, it must contain a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n.\n\nStatement 2: If a belongs to a finite group then |a| divides |G|.\n\nThis statement is also true. The order of an element a in a group G is defined as the smallest positive integer m such that a^m = e, where e is the identity element of the group. Since the order of an element divides the order of the group (by Lagrange's theorem), it follows that |a| divides |G|.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
