            "content": "To find the maximum possible order for an element in a direct product of groups, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the individual groups.\n\nIn this case, we have Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24. The orders of the groups are:\n\n1. Z_8: The order of Z_8 is 8, as it is the group of integers modulo 8.\n2. Z_10: The order of Z_10 is 10, as it is the group of integers modulo 10.\n3. Z_24: The order of Z_24 is 24, as it is the group of integers modulo 24.\n\nNow, we need to find the LCM of 8, 10, and 24. The prime factorization of these numbers are:\n\n8 = 2^3\n10 = 2 * 5\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:\n\nLCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 120\n\nSo, the maximum possible order for an element in Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24 is 120. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 120",
