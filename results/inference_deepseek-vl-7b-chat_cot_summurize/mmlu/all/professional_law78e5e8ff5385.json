            "content": "A state has recently released medical statistics showing that the number of new AIDS cases within the state has quadrupled from the preceding year. In 2008, the state reported that 2,250 people were diagnosed as being stricken with the AIDS virus. However, in 2009 the state confirmed that over 9,000 new persons contracted the deadly virus. In an effort to improve the health care of AIDS patients in the state, the Legislature has enacted a law providing public funds to assist privately owned hospitals. According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each AIDS patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of the state's statute?\n\nA. The statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, by adopting the controversial views of particular churches on abortion.\nB. The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment by conditioning the availability of public funds upon the recipient's agreement to act in a way that makes more difficult the exercise by others of their fundamental constitutional rights.\nC. The statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying nonAIDS patients the same subsidy benefits as those received by AIDS patients.\nD. The state will be unable to show it is advancing a legitimate governmental interest.\n",

            "content": "The strongest argument against the constitutionality of the state's statute would be that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is because the statute provides a specific subsidy to hospitals that do not perform abortions, which could be seen as treating certain hospitals differently based on their religious beliefs or practices. This could potentially lead to discrimination against hospitals that perform abortions, which is not allowed under the equal protection clause.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the constitutionality of the statute. Option A is about the establishment clause, which is not directly relevant to the equal protection clause. Option B is about the condition of the statute, but it does not directly relate to the equal protection clause. Option D is about the state's ability to show it is advancing a legitimate governmental interest, but it does not directly relate to the equal protection clause.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
