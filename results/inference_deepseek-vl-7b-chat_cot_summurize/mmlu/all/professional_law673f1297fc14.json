The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be\n\nA. excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\nB. excluded, because it is improper character evidence.\nC. admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.\nD. admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.\n",

This evidence is relevant to the issue of whether the candidate is a thief, as it is a past act that supports the newspaper's claim that the candidate is dishonest. However, it is not improper character evidence, as it is not being used to attack the candidate's character in a general sense, but rather to show that the candidate is not telling the truth about his past actions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the evidence is not being used to prove that the candidate is a thief, but rather to show that the candidate is not telling the truth about his past actions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the evidence is not being used to attack the candidate's character in a general sense, but rather to show that the candidate is not telling the truth about his past actions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the evidence is not being used to show that the candidate is a thief, but rather to show that the candidate is not telling the truth about his past actions.",
