            "content": "The problem is asking for the theoretically best possible elapsed times for a parallel program running on 2 and 4 processors, respectively. The program takes 100 seconds to run on a single processor. 40% of the computation is inherently sequential, meaning it will not benefit from additional processors.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes to run the program on 2 and 4 processors as T2 and T4, respectively. Since 40% of the computation is inherently sequential, the remaining 60% can be parallelized.\n\nFor 2 processors, the parallelized computation will be divided into 2 parts, each running on one processor. So, the time T2 will be the sum of the times for each part, i.e., T2 = T1 + T1, where T1 is the time for the inherently sequential part and T2 is the time for the parallelized part.\n\nFor 4 processors, the parallelized computation will be divided into 4 parts, each running on one processor. So, the time T4 will be the sum of the times for each part, i.e., T4 = T1 + T1 + T1 + T1, where T1 is the time for the inherently sequential part and T4 is the time for the parallelized part.\n\nSince the inherently sequential part takes 40% of the total time, we can write:\n\nT1 = 0.4 * 100 = 40 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate T2 and T4:\n\nT2 = T1 + T1 = 40 + 40 = 80 seconds\nT4 = T1 + T1 + T1 + T1 = 40 + 40 + 40 + 40 = 160 seconds\n\nSo, the theoretically best possible elapsed times for this program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively, are 80 and 160 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 70 and 55 seconds.",
