            "content": "Proportionality in relation to the options available to the victim State refers to the principle that the response of a victim State to an aggression should be commensurate with the severity of the aggression. This means that the means and intensity of force used by the victim State should be appropriate and not excessive in relation to the threat posed by the aggressor.\n\nIn the given options:\n\nA. The victim State may use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor - This option is not in line with the principle of proportionality. The victim State should not use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor, but rather should use the necessary means to respond to the aggression.\n\nB. The victim State may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor - This option is also not in line with the principle of proportionality. The means used by the victim State should be appropriate and not excessive in relation to the threat posed by the aggressor.\n\nC. The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor - This option aligns with the principle of proportionality. The victim State should use the necessary means to respond to the aggression, not more than what is necessary.\n\nD. The victim State can do nothing without Security Council approval - This option is not directly related to the principle of proportionality. While the Security Council may have a role in determining the response of a victim State, the principle of proportionality refers to the means and intensity of force used by the victim State, not the approval of the Security Council.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor.",
