The given data set is already in ascending order:\n\n8, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35, 10\n\nSince there are 9 data points (an odd number), the median will be the middle value. In this case, the median is the 5th value:\n\n8, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35, 10\n\nThe median is 24.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 24",
