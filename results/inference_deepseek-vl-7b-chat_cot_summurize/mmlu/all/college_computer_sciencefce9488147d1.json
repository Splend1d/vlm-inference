Since the cache is 2K-byte, each write operation will write 8 bytes to memory.\n\nIn the given loop, the operation A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i] is performed for each element in the array A. There are 256 elements in array A, so the loop will be executed 256 times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bytes written to memory will be 256 * 8 = 2048 bytes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 2048.",
