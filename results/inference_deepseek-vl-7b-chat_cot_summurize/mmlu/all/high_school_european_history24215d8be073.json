            "content": "The quotation provided by Edward Gibbon in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 1776\u20131788, suggests that the various modes of worship in the Roman world were considered by the people as equally true, by the philosopher as equally false, and by the magistrate as equally useful. This indicates that there was a general acceptance of religious pluralism in ancient Rome, with no single religion holding a monopoly over the beliefs of the people.\n\nOption A, the clergy's monopoly on academic scholarship in eighteenth-century Britain, is not supported by the quotation. The text does not mention any specific role of the clergy in academic scholarship during this time period.\n\nOption B, the hatred of all things Roman by British scholars in the eighteenth century, is also not supported by the quotation. The text does not suggest any general hatred of Roman things among British scholars.\n\nOption D, the lack of sources available to the eighteenth-century scholar for the study of ancient Roman civilization, is not directly supported by the quotation. While the text does mention the various modes of worship in Rome, it does not specifically address the availability of sources for the study of ancient Roman civilization.\n\nOption C, the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the eighteenth century, is supported by the quotation. The text suggests that the various modes of worship in the Roman world were considered equally true, false, and useful, which implies a general acceptance of religious pluralism and skepticism. This aligns with the idea that the educated elite of Britain in the eighteenth century were more open to religious skepticism and pluralism.\n\nTherefore, the interpretation of the state of religious belief in ancient Rome by the eighteenth-century English historian Edward Gibbon might be offered as evidence for the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the eighteenth century.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
