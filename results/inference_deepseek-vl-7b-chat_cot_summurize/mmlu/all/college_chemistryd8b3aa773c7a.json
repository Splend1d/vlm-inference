            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal activity = Initial activity * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial activity is 150 mCi, the time elapsed is 24 hours, and the half-life is 6.0 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal activity = 150 * (1/2)^(24 / 6)\n\nFinal activity = 150 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal activity = 150 * (1/16)\n\nFinal activity = 9.4 mCi\n\nSo, 9.4 mCi of the radioactive isotope will remain 24 hours after delivery.
