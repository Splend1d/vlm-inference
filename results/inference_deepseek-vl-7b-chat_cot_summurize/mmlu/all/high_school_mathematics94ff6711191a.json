            "content": "To find the volume of the solid, we first need to find the dimensions of the base. The base is a square with side length equal to the distance from the point (0,0) to the line y = 2. This distance is the square root of the difference between the two equations:\n\nx^2 - 4y = 0\nx^2 = 4y\n\nx^2 = 4(2)\nx^2 = 8\n\nx = \u221a8\n\nNow, we can find the side length of the square base:\n\nSide length = x = \u221a8\n\nThe volume of a square is side length cubed, so the volume of the base is:\n\nVolume of base = (Side length)^3 = (\u221a8)^3 = 8\u221a8\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the solid. The height is the distance from the base to the line y = 2. This distance is the x-coordinate of the point where the line y = 2 intersects the base. We can find this point by setting y = 2 in the equation of the base:\n\nx^2 = 4(2)\nx^2 = 8\n\nx = \u221a8\n\nNow, we can find the height:\n\nHeight = y = 2\n\nFinally, we can find the volume of the solid:\n\nVolume = (Base volume) * (Height) = (8\u221a8) * 2 = 16\u221a8\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options.
