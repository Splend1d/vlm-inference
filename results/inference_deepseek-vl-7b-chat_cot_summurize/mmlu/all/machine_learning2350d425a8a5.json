There are several models that have achieved accuracy above 98% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. For example, the EfficientNet-B7 model by TensorFlow Research Europe achieved a top-1 accuracy of 99.36% and a top-5 accuracy of 99.27% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\nStatement 2: The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer.\nThis statement is false. The original ResNets, which were proposed by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun in their paper \"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition,\" were indeed optimized with the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm that has been widely used in deep learning research, and it was introduced by Diederik P. Kingma and Jimmy Ba in their paper \"Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization.\" The original ResNets were trained using the Adam optimizer, which helped to improve their performance.",
