To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nWhich of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives?\n\nA.

Furs from local natives. This is because the passage suggests that one of the most effective ways to bring and keep the Indians in a proper state of subordination is by letting them feel their dependence on the foodstuffs and manufactured goods that the Hudson's Bay Company sells them. Furs were a valuable commodity in the fur trade, which was a significant part of the Hudson's Bay Company's business. Therefore, it would make sense that Simpson would be interested in obtaining furs from the local natives to maintain their dependence on the Company's goods.",
