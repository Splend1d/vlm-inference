In the middle of his five-mile race, Jerome grabs water from the water station to quench his thirst.\n\nDrive-reduction theories explain that people eat to satisfy both their drives (hunger and thirst) and their reductions (satiety). In this case, Jerome is eating to quench his thirst, which is a reduction drive, so drive-reduction theories would provide a reasonable explanation for his behavior.\n\nB. Ernest gobbles a few cookies on his way to class because he did not have time for lunch.\n\nErnest is eating cookies to satisfy his hunger, which is a drive, so drive-reduction theories would provide a reasonable explanation for his behavior.\n\nC. Tish decides to skip lunch because she is still full from eating a very large breakfast.\n\nTish is not eating because she is still full from her previous meal, which is a reduction drive, so drive-reduction theories would provide a reasonable explanation for her behavior.\n\nD. Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway.\n\nKezia is eating the strawberry cheesecake despite being very full from her previous meal, which is a reduction drive, so drive-reduction theories would not provide a reasonable explanation for her behavior.",
