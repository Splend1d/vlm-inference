The target variable manufacturing cost is the selling price minus the contribution margin, which is the selling price minus the variable selling and distribution costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the contribution margin:\n\nContribution margin = Selling price - Variable selling and distribution costs\nContribution margin = $19.00 - $3.00 = $16.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the target variable manufacturing cost:\n\nTarget variable manufacturing cost = Contribution margin - Selling price\nTarget variable manufacturing cost = $16.00 - $19.00 = -$3.00\n\nSince the target variable manufacturing cost cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement.
