Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n\u2014Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nIn her speech, Eleanor Roosevelt alluded to the earlier threat to civil liberties created by which of the following?\n\nA. World War I\nB. The New Deal\nC. The Cold War\nD. The Great Depression\n",

It led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest. During this time, civil liberties were often threatened as governments sought to maintain control and stability. For example, freedom of speech and assembly were often suppressed to prevent public unrest.\n\nThe other options are not mentioned in the text. World War I (A) occurred after Eleanor Roosevelt's speech, and the New Deal (B) and the Cold War (C) were not yet in existence at that time.",
