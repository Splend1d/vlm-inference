However, he does not claim that people cannot be morally assessed for what is due to factors beyond their control (option C).\n\nNagel's argument is based on the idea that people cannot be morally assessed without the ability to reflect on their actions and intentions. He argues that people are often unaware of the reasons behind their actions and the impact they have on others. Therefore, they cannot be held morally responsible for actions that are influenced by factors beyond their control, as they are not aware of these factors and cannot control them.\n\nIn summary, Nagel's argument does not support the claim that people cannot be morally assessed for what is due to factors beyond their control (option C).",
