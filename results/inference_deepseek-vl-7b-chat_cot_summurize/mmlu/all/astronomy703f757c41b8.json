            "content": "To find the mass of the Martian atmosphere, we can use the ideal gas law, which states that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume and directly proportional to its temperature. The formula for the ideal gas law is:\n\nP = k * T\n\nwhere P is the pressure, k is the Boltzmann constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K), T is the temperature, and moles (m) and volume (V) are related by the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K), and V is the volume.\n\nWe are given the pressure (P = 600 Pa), the acceleration due to gravity (g = 4 m/s\u00b2), and the surface area (A = 1,450,000,000 km\u00b2). We can use these values to find the volume of the Martian atmosphere.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the acceleration due to gravity from m/s\u00b2 to m/s\u00b2. Since 1 m/s\u00b2 is equal to 1000 Pa, we have:\n\ng = 4 m/s\u00b2 = 4 * 1000 Pa = 4000 Pa\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume of the Martian atmosphere:\n\nV = k * T / P\n\nwhere k = 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K, T = 273.15 K (the temperature of the Martian atmosphere), and P = 600 Pa.\n\nV = (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K) * (273.15 K) / (600 Pa)\n\nV \u2248 1.414 * 10^(-5) m\u00b3\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles (n) of the Martian atmosphere:\n\nn = V / R\n\nwhere R = 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K.\n\nn = (1.414 * 10^(-5) m\u00b3) / (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K)\n\nn \u2248 1.72 * 10^(-5) mol\n\nFinally, we can use the ideal gas law to find the mass (m) of the Martian atmosphere:\n\nm = n * M\n\nwhere M is the molar mass of the Martian atmosphere.\n\nm = (1.72 * 10^(-5) mol) * (2.2 * 10^(-3) kg/mol)\n\nm \u2248 3.95 * 10^(-4) kg\n\nSince the mass of the Martian atmosphere is a very small fraction of the surface area of Mars, we can round the mass to the nearest significant figure:\n\nm \u2248 4 * 10^(-4) kg\n\nSo, the approximate mass of the Martian atmosphere is 4 * 10^(-4) kg, which is approximately 2.2 * 10^(-4) kg.
