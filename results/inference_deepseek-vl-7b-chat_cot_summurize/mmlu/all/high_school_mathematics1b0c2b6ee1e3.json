            "content": "To find the probability of all the draws alternating colors, we need to consider the possible outcomes. There are 8 balls in total, so there are 8 possible outcomes for each draw. Since the box contains 4 white balls and 4 black balls, there are 4 ways to draw a white ball and 4 ways to draw a black ball.\n\nThe probability of drawing a white ball on the first draw is 4/8, and the probability of drawing a black ball on the second draw is also 4/8. The probability of drawing a white ball on the third draw is 4/8, and the probability of drawing a black ball on the fourth draw is 4/8.\n\nSince each draw is independent of the others, we can multiply the probabilities together to find the probability of all the draws alternating colors:\n\n(4/8) * (4/8) * (4/8) * (4/8) = (4^4) / (8^4) = 256 / 4096 = 1/16\n\nHowever, this is the probability of all the draws being white, not alternating colors. To find the probability of alternating colors, we need to consider the cases where the first draw is white, the second draw is black, the third draw is white, and the fourth draw is black. There are 4 ways this can happen:\n\n1. White - Black - White - Black\n2. White - Black - Black - White\n3. Black - White - White - Black\n4. Black - White - Black - White\n\nFor each of these cases, the probability is (4/8) * (4/8) * (4/8) * (4/8) = (4^4) / (8^4) = 256 / 4096 = 1/16.\n\nSince there are 4 cases where the draws alternate colors, the total probability of all the draws alternating colors is 4 * (1/16) = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
