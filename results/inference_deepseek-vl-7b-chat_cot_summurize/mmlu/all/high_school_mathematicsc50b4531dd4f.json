            "content": "To find the upward velocity at t = 1, we need to find the derivative of the position function with respect to time and then evaluate it at t = 1.\n\nThe position function is given by:\nx(t) = 4 cos(t) + cos(12t)\ny(t) = 4 sin(t) + sin(12t)\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of x(t) with respect to t:\ndx/dt = -4 sin(t) + 12 cos(t)\n\nNext, let's find the derivative of y(t) with respect to t:\ndy/dt = -4 sin(t) + 12 sin(12t)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these derivatives at t = 1:\ndx/dt(1) = -4 sin(1) + 12 cos(1)\ndy/dt(1) = -4 sin(1) + 12 sin(12)\n\nTo find the upward velocity, we need to find the component of the velocity that is in the upward direction. This is the y-component of the velocity, which is given by:\n\nv_y(t) = dy/dt(t)\n\nAt t = 1, the y-component of the velocity is:\n\nv_y(1) = -4 sin(1) + 12 sin(12)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of this expression. We can use a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nsin(1) \u2248 0.8414\nsin(12) \u2248 0.9999\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression:\n\nv_y(1) = -4 * 0.8414 + 12 * 0.9999\nv_y(1) \u2248 -3.3656 + 11.999\nv_y(1) \u2248 12.287\n\nSo, the upward velocity at t = 1 is approximately 12.287.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
