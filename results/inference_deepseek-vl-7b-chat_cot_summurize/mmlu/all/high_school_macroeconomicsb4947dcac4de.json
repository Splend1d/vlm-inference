This can lead to higher prices, as consumers are willing to pay more for better quality products. Therefore, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the average change in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers, would increase.\n\nB. automatically decrease is incorrect because a decrease in product quality would lead to lower prices, not higher ones.\n\nC. become negative is incorrect because the CPI is a measure of price changes, not the absolute value of prices.\n\nD. overestimate the inflation rate is incorrect because the CPI is designed to measure the rate of inflation, not to overestimate it.",
