Purchase of Otra bonds: Verity purchased $200,000 of Otra bonds at par. Since the bonds were purchased at par, there is no cash outflow for this transaction.\n\n2. Purchase of Treasury bills: Verity purchased $50,000 of U.S. Treasury bills. This is a cash outflow of $50,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net cash used in investing activities:\n\nNet cash used in investing activities = Cash outflow for investing activities - Cash inflow from investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities = $50,000 (Treasury bills) - $0 (Otrad bonds)\n\nNet cash used in investing activities = $50,000\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $150,000.",
