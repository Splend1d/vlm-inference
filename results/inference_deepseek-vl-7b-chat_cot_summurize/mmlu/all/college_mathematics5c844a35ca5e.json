            "content": "To find the dimensions of the null space n and range r of the operator D, we need to find the dimensions of the null space and range of the derivative operator D acting on polynomials with coefficients in Z_5.\n\nThe derivative operator D sends a polynomial p(x) in P to its derivative p'(x). Since the degree of the polynomials is less than or equal to 7, the highest degree of the derivative will also be 7.\n\nFor a polynomial of degree 7, the derivative will be a polynomial of degree 6. The derivative of a polynomial with degree 6 will be a polynomial with degree 5, and so on. Therefore, the highest degree of the derivative will be 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the null space n of D. The null space of a linear operator is the set of all vectors that the operator maps to the zero vector. In this case, the null space will be the set of all polynomials in P that have a derivative of degree 1.\n\nSince the highest degree of the derivative is 1, the polynomials in the null space will be of the form x^k, where k is a non-negative integer. The dimension of the null space n will be the number of non-negative integers k such that x^k is in P.\n\nFor k = 0, x^0 = 1, which is in P. For k = 1, x^1 = x, which is in P. For k = 2, x^2 = x^2, which is in P. For k = 3, x^3 = x^3, which is in P. For k = 4, x^4 = x^4, which is in P. For k = 5, x^5 = x^5, which is in P. For k = 6, x^6 = x^6, which is in P.\n\nSo, there are 7 non-negative integers k such that x^k is in P. Therefore, the dimension of the null space n is 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the range r of D. The range of a linear operator is the set of all vectors that the operator maps to. In this case, the range will be the set of all polynomials in P that have a derivative of degree 1.\n\nSince the highest degree of the derivative is 1, the polynomials in the range will be of the form x^k, where k is a non-negative integer. The dimension of the range r will be the number of non-negative integers k such that x^k is in P.\n\nFor k = 0, x^0 = 1, which is in P. For k = 1, x^1 = x, which is in P. For k = 2, x^2 = x^2, which is in P. For k = 3, x^3 = x^3, which is in P. For k = 4, x^4 = x^4, which is in P. For k = 5, x^5 = x^5, which is in P. For k = 6, x^6 = x^6, which is in P.\n\nSo, there are 7 non-negative integers k such that x^k is in P. Therefore, the dimension of the range r is 7.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the null space n and range r of the operator D are both 7. So, the correct answer is:\n\nD. n = 2 and r = 6",
