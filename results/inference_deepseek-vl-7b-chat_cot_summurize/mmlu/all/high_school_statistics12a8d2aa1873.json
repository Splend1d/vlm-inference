In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.\nB. In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges.\nC.

            "content": "A. In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.\n\nThe correct answer is A. This statement is true because a 95 percent confidence interval means that we can be 95 percent confident that the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety lies within the interval. This means that in repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges.\n\nB. In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges.\n\nThis statement is not true. A 95 percent confidence interval is used to estimate the population mean, not the sample mean. The sample mean is the average of the oranges in the sample, while the population mean is the average of all the oranges of the variety.\n\nC. Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.\n\nThis statement is not true. A 95 percent confidence interval is used to estimate the population mean, not the sample mean. The sample mean is the average of the oranges in the sample, while the population mean is the average of all the oranges of the variety.\n\nD. Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.\n\nThis statement is not true. A 95 percent confidence interval is used to estimate the population mean, not the population weight of all the oranges of the variety. The population weight of all the oranges of the variety is the total weight of all the oranges, which is not given in the problem.",
