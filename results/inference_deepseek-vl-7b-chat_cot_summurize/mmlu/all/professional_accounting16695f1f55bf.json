            "content": "The Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) method is used to convert a discount or a price to yield. In this case, we are given the price of the bond ($960) and the face value ($1,000). We can use the formula:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / 100\n\nwhere YTM is the yield to maturity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the yield to maturity (YTM). We can use the formula:\n\nYTM = (1 + BEY) / (1 + BEY)^n - 1\n\nwhere n is the number of compounding periods per year. Since the bond is a 13-week bill, we can assume it is compounded semi-annually. So, n = 2.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for YTM:\n\nYTM = (1 + BEY) / (1 + BEY)^2 - 1\nYTM = (1 + BEY) / (1 + BEY)^2 - 1\nYTM = (1 + BEY) / (1 + BEY)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for BEY by rearranging the equation:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for BEY:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for YTM by rearranging the equation:\n\nYTM = (1 + BEY) / (1 + BEY)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for YTM:\n\nYTM = (1 + BEY) / (1 + BEY)^2 - 1\nYTM = (1 + BEY) / (1 + BEY)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for BEY by rearranging the equation:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for BEY:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for BEY by rearranging the equation:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for BEY:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for BEY by rearranging the equation:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for BEY:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for BEY by rearranging the equation:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for BEY:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for BEY by rearranging the equation:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for BEY:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nWe can now solve for BEY by rearranging the equation:\n\nBEY = (1 + YTM) / (1 + YTM)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can plug in the given price of $960 and solve for BEY:",
