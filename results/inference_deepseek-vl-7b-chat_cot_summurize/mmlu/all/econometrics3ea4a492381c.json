This is because the RSS is a measure of the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable, and it is calculated for the entire sample. The RSS for the first sub-sample and the second sub-sample would be restricted because they are only considering a portion of the data, and the sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples would also be restricted because it is simply the sum of the RSS for each sub-sample. Therefore, the correct answer is A. The RSS for the whole sample.",
