The truth table will have 2^3 = 8 rows, where each row represents a different combination of truth values for S, T, and U.\n\nHere is the truth table:\n\n| S | T | U | ~S | ~T | ~U | ~S \u2228 T | ~S \u00b7 U | ~T \u2228 U / T \u00b7 U |\n|---|---|---|----|----|----|--------|----------|----------------|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1       | 0         | 0              |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1       | 1         | 0              |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1       | 0         | 0              |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0       | 0         | 0              |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0       | 0         | 1              |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0       | 0         | 0              |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0       | 0         | 0              |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1       | 1         | 1              |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table to determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\n1. ~S \u2228 T:\n   - When S is true, ~S is false, and ~T is true. So, ~S \u2228 T is true.\n   - When S is false, ~S is true, and ~T is true. So, ~S \u2228 T is true.\n   - Therefore, ~S \u2228 T is always true.\n\n2. ~S \u00b7 U:\n   - When S is true, ~S is false, and U is true. So, ~S \u00b7 U is false.\n   - When S is false, ~S is true, and U is true. So, ~S \u00b7 U is false.\n   - When S is false and U is false, ~S \u00b7 U is true.\n   - Therefore, ~S \u00b7 U is false when S is true and true when S is false.\n\n3. ~T \u2228 U / T \u00b7 U:\n   - When T is true, ~T is false, and U is true. So, ~T \u2228 U / T \u00b7 U is false.\n   - When T is false, ~T is true, and U is true. So, ~T \u2228 U / T \u00b7 U is false.\n   - When T is false and U is false, ~T \u2228 U / T \u00b7 U is true.\n   - Therefore, ~T \u2228 U / T \u00b7 U is false when T is true and true when T is false.\n\nSince the argument is valid for all cases, the correct option is:\n\nA.
