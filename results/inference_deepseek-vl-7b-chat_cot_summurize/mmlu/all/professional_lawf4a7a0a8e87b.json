The man decided to set fire to the waste paper in a trash container. He hoped that the fire would serve as a diversion so he and his date could run out of the restaurant without paying. He set fire to the waste paper and then went back to his table. As he anxiously waited, the maitre d' grabbed the man and told him that he had seen what occurred in the bathroom. The maitre d', who had been seated in a bathroom stall, saw the man, through a crack in the door, set the fire. The maitre d' extinguished the fire, which had charred a portion of the ceiling. This jurisdiction defines arson as the malicious burning of any structure. If charged with arson, the man should be found\n\nA. guilty, because he was reckless as to the restaurant's being damaged by fire.\nB. guilty, because he set the fire for the purpose of committing an unlawful act.\nC. not guilty, because he did not intend to burn down the restaurant.\nD. not guilty, because the fire only charred a portion of the ceiling.\n",

This is a clear case of arson, as defined in the jurisdiction, which states that it is the malicious burning of any structure. The man's action of setting the fire in the bathroom with the intention of committing an unlawful act (not paying the bill) makes him guilty of arson.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the man's action was reckless, but it was not the main reason for the damage to the restaurant. The fire only charred a portion of the ceiling, which is not the main focus of the definition of arson.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the man's intention was to create a diversion to avoid paying the bill, which is a clear case of arson.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the definition of arson does not require the entire structure to be burned down. The man's action of setting the fire in the bathroom was malicious and for the purpose of committing an unlawful act, which makes him guilty of arson.",
