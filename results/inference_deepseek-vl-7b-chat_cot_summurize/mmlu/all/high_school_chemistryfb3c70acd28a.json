Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons.\n\n1. S\u2013O: The electronegativity difference between sulfur (16.0) and oxygen (3.2) is 12.8. This is a large difference, which indicates a strong attraction between the two atoms.\n\n2. P\u2013F: The electronegativity difference between phosphorus (3.98) and fluorine (3.98) is 0.0. This is a very small difference, indicating a weak attraction between the two atoms.\n\n3. C\u2013B: The electronegativity difference between carbon (2.55) and boron (2.0) is 0.55. This is a moderate difference, indicating a moderate attraction between the two atoms.\n\n4. C\u2013N: The electronegativity difference between carbon (2.55) and nitrogen (3.04) is 0.49. This is a moderate difference, indicating a moderate attraction between the two atoms.\n\nBased on the electronegativity differences, the bond with the largest polarity is expected to be S\u2013O (12.8).",
