            "content": "In a secluded county, where prejudice festers and discrimination flourishes, there is a lovely lake, which the county has developed and maintained for recreational purposes. Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.\nB. The plaintiff will prevail unless denial of membership to women can be justified by some \"compelling interest,\" since such discrimination is \"suspect\" and requires the strictest equal protection test.\nC. The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.\nD. The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D. The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n\nThe plaintiff's claim is that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that the company's policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. To prevail, the plaintiff must show that the company's policy of excluding women has no important basis and is not necessary to serve a compelling interest. If the company can prove that there is a valid reason for the exclusion of women, such as the need to maintain a certain level of exclusivity or a specific clientele, then the plaintiff may not succeed in her lawsuit.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The statement about classifications based on sex not yet being held to violate the equal protection clause is not relevant to the case. The case is about the plaintiff's claim that she was denied membership because of her sex, not about the legality of sex-based classifications.\n\nB. The statement about discrimination being \"suspect\" and requiring the strictest equal protection test is not accurate. The case is about the plaintiff's claim of sex discrimination, not about the legality of other types of discrimination.\n\nC. The statement that other similar facilities are available to women is not relevant to the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff is arguing that she should be allowed to join the yacht club, not that she should be allowed to join other facilities.",
