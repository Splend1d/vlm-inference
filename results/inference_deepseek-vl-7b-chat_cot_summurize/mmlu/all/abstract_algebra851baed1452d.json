By definition, a cyclic group of order n is a group that can be generated by a single element. Since every positive integer n is a divisor of the order of the group, there will always be a cyclic group of order n.\n\nStatement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This statement is also true. In a finite cyclic group, every non-identity element has an order that is a divisor of the order of the group. This is because the group is generated by that element, and the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n equals the identity element.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
