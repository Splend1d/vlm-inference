Since Bob always tells the truth, Mary can ask him questions that will eliminate half of the possible answers with each question.\n\nFor example, if Bob wrote down a number between 1 and 500, Mary could ask:\n\n1. \"Is your number odd?\"\n2. \"Is your number greater than 250?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to both questions, then the number must be between 251 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n3. \"Is your number greater than 300?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 301 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n4. \"Is your number greater than 350?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 351 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n5. \"Is your number greater than 400?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 401 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n6. \"Is your number greater than 450?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 451 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n7. \"Is your number greater than 475?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 476 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n8. \"Is your number greater than 490?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 491 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n9. \"Is your number greater than 495?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 496 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n10. \"Is your number greater than 498?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be between 499 and 500. Mary can then ask:\n\n11. \"Is your number greater than 499?\"\n\nIf Bob answers \"yes\" to this question, then the number must be exactly 500.\n\nIn the worst case, Mary would need to ask 11 questions to determine the number that Bob wrote down.
