A sample survey allows you to collect data from a specific group (in this case, male and female students taking AP Statistics) to make generalizations about the entire population. This method is useful for comparing the AP Statistics exam results between the two groups.\n\nA census, experiment, and observational study are not suitable for this task. A census would involve collecting data from the entire population, which is not feasible in this case. An experiment would involve manipulating one or more variables to observe their effects, which is not relevant to comparing exam results. An observational study would involve observing and recording data without any intervention, which would not provide the necessary information to compare exam results between the two groups.",
