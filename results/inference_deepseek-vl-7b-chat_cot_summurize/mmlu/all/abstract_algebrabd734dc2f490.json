            "content": "Statement 1: Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.\nThis statement is true. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in a group of order 45 is congruent to 1 mod 5 and divides 45. Since 45 = 9 * 5, there must be at least one 5-Sylow subgroup of order 9. By the same theorem, there must also be at least one 5-Sylow subgroup of order 15. Since the orders of these two subgroups are relatively prime, they are both normal in the group. Their intersection is trivial, so the product of their orders is equal to the order of the group, which is 45. Therefore, there is a subgroup of order 10, which is the product of the orders of the two normal subgroups.\n\nStatement 2: A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\nThis statement is false. The number of left cosets of H in G is equal to the index of H in G, which is the number of distinct left cosets of H. The number of right cosets of H in G is equal to the index of H in G, which is also the number of distinct right cosets of H. However, these two numbers are not necessarily equal. For example, consider the group Z_4 and the subgroup Z_2. The number of left cosets of Z_2 in Z_4 is 2, while the number of right cosets of Z_2 in Z_4 is 2. Therefore, the number of left cosets of H in G is not necessarily equal to the number of right cosets of H.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
