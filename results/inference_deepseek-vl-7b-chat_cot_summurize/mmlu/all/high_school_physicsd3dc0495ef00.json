We can rearrange the equation to solve for the force (kx) acting on the particle:\n\nkx = (1/2)mv^2 - (1/2)KE\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nkx = (1/2)(3.0 m/s)(3.0 m/s) - (1/2)(-6.0 J/s)\n\nkx = (1/2)(9.0 m^2/s^2) - (-3.0 J/s)\n\nkx = 4.5 m^2/s^2 + 3.0 J/s\n\nkx = 7.5 m^2/s^2\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the force (F) using the spring constant (k):\n\nF = kx\n\nF = 7.5 m^2/s^2\n\nF = 7.5 N\n\nSo, the magnitude of the force on the particle at this moment is 7.5 N.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9.0 N.",
