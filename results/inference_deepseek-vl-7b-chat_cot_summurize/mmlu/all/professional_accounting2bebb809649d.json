These costs should be expensed as research and development costs. The labor and material costs for the prototype are also part of the development process, but they are not directly related to the patent filing. Therefore, only the costs for the prototype and patent filing should be expensed as research and development costs.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they include costs that are not directly related to the development of Product X. For example, the production costs should be expensed as manufacturing costs, not research and development costs.",
