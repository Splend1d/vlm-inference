            "content": "To find the ratio of exchange of market prices, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of shares of Company Y that can be exchanged for one share of Company X.\n\nWe are given that X offers three-fourths a share of common stock for each share of Y. This means that for every 1 share of Y, X offers 3/4 shares of X.\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\nNumber of shares of X = 3/4 * Number of shares of Y\n\nWe are also given the market prices of X and Y:\n\nMarket price of X = $45\nMarket price of Y = $30\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of exchange of market prices:\n\n(Market price of X / Number of shares of X) / (Market price of Y / Number of shares of Y) = 1\n\nLet's substitute the values we have:\n\n($45 / (3/4 * Number of shares of Y)) / ($30 / Number of shares of Y) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n($45 / (3/4 * Number of shares of Y)) = ($30 / Number of shares of Y)\n\nTo simplify, let's multiply both sides of the equation by (3/4 * Number of shares of Y):\n\n$45 = ($30 * (3/4 * Number of shares of Y))\n\nNow, divide both sides of the equation by $30:\n\n$45 / $30 = (3/4 * Number of shares of Y)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.5 = (3/4 * Number of shares of Y)\n\nNow, divide both sides of the equation by (3/4):\n\n1.5 / (3/4) = Number of shares of Y\n\nSimplify:\n\nNumber of shares of Y = 2\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of exchange of market prices:\n\n(Market price of X / Number of shares of X) / (Market price of Y / Number of shares of Y) = 1\n\n($45 / (3/4 * 2)) / ($30 / 2) = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n($45 / 1.5) / ($30 / 1) = 1\n\n($30) / ($30) = 1\n\nThe ratio of exchange of market prices is 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B.",
