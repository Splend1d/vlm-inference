I and III only.\n\nThe reason is that the operation is not associative (I), meaning that the equation m \u2022 n \u2260 n \u2022 m for all m and n in Z. This is because the operation is defined as m \u2022 n = m + n + mn, which is not necessarily commutative.\n\nHowever, the operation is not defined to have an identity element (II), and it is not stated that all elements have an inverse (III). Therefore, statements II and III are not necessarily true.\n\nStatement IV is not true because the operation is not defined to have an identity element, and it is not stated that all elements have an inverse.",
