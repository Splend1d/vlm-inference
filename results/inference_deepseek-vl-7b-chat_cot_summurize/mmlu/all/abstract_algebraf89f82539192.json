            "content": "Statement 1: In a finite dimensional vector space every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.\n\nThis statement is true. In a finite-dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors is indeed contained in a basis. A basis is a set of vectors that spans the entire vector space and is linearly independent. Therefore, every linearly independent set of vectors is a subset of the basis, and thus is contained in the basis.\n\nStatement 2: If B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B_1| = |B_2|.\n\nThis statement is false. The cardinality (or size) of a basis is not necessarily equal to the cardinality of another basis for the same vector space. For example, consider the vector space of all real-valued functions on the interval [0, 1]. The basis for this space consists of the indicator functions {1, 0} and {0, 1}. The cardinality of this basis is 2, but the basis for the same vector space consisting of the functions {1, 0, 1, 0} has cardinality 4. Therefore, |B_1| \u2260 |B_2|.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
