            "content": "To find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days, we need to find the interquartile range (IQR) of the data. The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile).\n\nFirst, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Since the data is normally distributed, we can use the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule) to find the values. This rule states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n\nIn this case, the mean is 3,250 and the standard deviation is 320. So, we can find the values of Q1 and Q3 as follows:\n\nQ1 = mean - 1 standard deviation = 3,250 - 320 = 2,930\nQ3 = mean + 1 standard deviation = 3,250 + 320 = 3,570\n\nNow, we can find the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 3,570 - 2,930 = 640\n\nFinally, we can find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days by adding and subtracting the IQR from the mean:\n\nLower limit = mean - IQR = 3,250 - 640 = 2,610\nUpper limit = mean + IQR = 3,250 + 640 = 3,890\n\nSo, the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is (2,610, 3,890), which corresponds to option C.",
