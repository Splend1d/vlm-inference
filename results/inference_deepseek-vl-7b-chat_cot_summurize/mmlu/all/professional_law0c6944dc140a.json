No, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials.\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract.\n",
