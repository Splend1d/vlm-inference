A CRI of 100 indicates that the light source perfectly reproduces the colour of objects, while a CRI of 0 indicates that the light source washes out or alters the colours.\n\nLEDs have a CRI of 80 to 100, which means they can accurately reproduce the colour of objects. Fluorescent lamps have a CRI of around 80, incandescent lamps have a CRI of around 100, and high pressure sodium vapour lamps have a CRI of around 20 to 30. Therefore, LED lamps have the best CRI among the options provided.",
