            "content": "Statement 1: Every group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian.\nThis statement is true. A group of order p^2, where p is a prime number, is indeed Abelian. This is because the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups, and in this case, the only Sylow p-subgroups are cyclic, and therefore isomorphic to the group itself. Since the group is generated by two elements of order p, the group is commutative.\n\nStatement 2: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.\nThis statement is also true. By Sylow's Theorems, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is normal if and only if it is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of G. This is because if there were other Sylow p-subgroups, they would have to be conjugate to the given one, and thus would also be normal.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
