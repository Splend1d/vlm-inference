The force of gravity acting on the first book (mg) is balanced by the tension in the string, which is equal to the weight of the second book (mg). As a result, the acceleration of the second book is zero.\n\nHowever, the acceleration of the first book is not necessarily g. The tension in the string is not constant, and it changes as the first book falls. The acceleration of the first book is equal to the change in its weight divided by the change in its distance from the table. Since the second book is dragged horizontally, the distance between the books is constant, so the acceleration of the first book is equal to the change in its weight divided by the change in its distance from the table.\n\nThe change in the weight of the first book is equal to the weight of the second book, which is mg. The change in the distance of the first book from the table is equal to the length of the string, which is L. Therefore, the acceleration of the first book is equal to mg/L.\n\nSince mg/L is not necessarily equal to g, the acceleration of the first book is a value between zero and g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. a value between zero and g.",
