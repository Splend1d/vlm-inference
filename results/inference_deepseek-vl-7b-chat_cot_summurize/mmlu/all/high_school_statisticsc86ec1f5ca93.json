Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust, an inspector tests a sample of units, calculating a mean of 9350 pounds with a z-score of -2.46 and a P-value of 0.0069. Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?\n\nA. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9350 pounds.\nB. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.\nC. 0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds.\nD. There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.\n",
