The function preserves the group operation, i.e., (axa^2)(bxa^2) = a(xab)(a^2b) for all x, y in G.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. G is abelian: This means that the group operation is commutative, i.e., for all x, y in G, x*y = y*x. However, this condition alone does not guarantee that the function x -> axa^2 is a homomorphism.\n\nB. G = {e}: This means that the group is trivial, i.e., it only contains the identity element e.
