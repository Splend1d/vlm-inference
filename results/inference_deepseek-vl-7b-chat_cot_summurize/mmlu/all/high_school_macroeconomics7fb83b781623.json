Unemployment will increase.\n\nWhen expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary (easy money) policies are used simultaneously, it usually leads to an increase in unemployment. This is because both policies aim to increase aggregate demand in the economy, which can cause an oversupply of goods and services, leading to higher unemployment.\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy involves the government increasing its spending or decreasing its taxes, while expansionary monetary policy involves the central bank lowering interest rates to make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending. Together, these policies can lead to an increase in inflation and a decrease in interest rates, which can make borrowing more attractive and lead to increased spending and investment. However, this increased spending and investment can also lead to an oversupply of goods and services, which can cause unemployment to increase.",
