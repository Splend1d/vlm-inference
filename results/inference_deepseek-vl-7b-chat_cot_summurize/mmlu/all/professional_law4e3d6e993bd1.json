If the confession was not voluntary, it would not be considered reliable and therefore should not be admitted as evidence in court.\n\nOn the other hand, if the confession was voluntary (option B), it would be admissible as evidence. This means that the defendant freely and voluntarily made the statement without any coercion or pressure from the police.\n\nOption C, \"The defendant was not in custody when the statement was made,\" is not a valid reason for inadmissibility. The location where the statement was made does not necessarily affect its admissibility.\n\nOption D, \"The statement was not made in response to a known police interrogation,\" is also not a valid reason for inadmissibility. The method of obtaining the confession does not necessarily affect its admissibility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A, \"The defendant's statement was involuntary.\"",
