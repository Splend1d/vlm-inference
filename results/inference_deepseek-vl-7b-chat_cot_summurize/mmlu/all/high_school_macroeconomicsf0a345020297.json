Productivity of labor can be calculated by dividing the output by the number of workers.\n\nLet's calculate the productivity of labor in both countries:\n\nCountry X:\nOutput = 30000 units\nNumber of workers = 3000\nProductivity of labor in Country X = Output / Number of workers = 30000 / 3000 = 10 units/worker\n\nCountry Z:\nOutput = 40000 units\nNumber of workers = 8000\nProductivity of labor in Country Z = Output / Number of workers = 40000 / 8000 = 5 units/worker\n\nNow, let's compare the productivity of labor in both countries:\n\nA. The productivity of labor in Country Z is 33 percent higher than in Country X.\nB. The productivity of labor in Country Z is 25 percent higher than in Country X.\nC. The productivity of labor in Country X is 33 percent higher than in Country Z.\nD. The productivity of labor in Country X is twice as much as Country Z.\n\nComparing the productivity of labor in both countries:\n\nProductivity of labor in Country X = 10 units/worker\nProductivity of labor in Country Z = 5 units/worker\n\nThe productivity of labor in Country Z is 5 units/worker, which is 50% higher than the productivity of labor in Country X (10 units/worker). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The productivity of labor in Country Z is 25 percent higher than in Country X.",
