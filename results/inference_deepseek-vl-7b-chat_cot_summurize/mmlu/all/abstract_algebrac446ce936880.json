In this case, we have the group Z_11 x Z_15 and the normal subgroup <1, 1>.\n\nZ_11 = {0, 1, 2, ..., 10} is the group of addition modulo 11.\nZ_15 = {0, 1, 2, ..., 14} is the group of addition modulo 15.\n\nThe order of Z_11 x Z_15 is the product of the orders of the two groups, which is |Z_11| * |Z_15| = 11 * 15 = 165.\n\nThe order of the normal subgroup <1, 1> is 2, since it contains only the elements 1 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) is |Z_11 x Z_15| / |<1, 1>| = 165 / 2 = 82.5.\n\nHowever, the order of a factor group must be an integer. This means that the problem statement is incorrect, as the factor group cannot have an order of 82.5. The correct order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) is 165 / 2 = 82.5, but this is not an integer, so it is not possible to find an order of 82.5 for the factor group.",
