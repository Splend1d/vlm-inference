Because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% in funds compared to the previous year. To raise this additional money, the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. What will be the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city?\n\nA. $23,000\nB. $25,300\nC. $28,000\nD. $30,300\n",

            "content": "The new mean of the appraised house values will be $125,000 + $5,000 = $130,000.\n\nThe new standard deviation will be the square root of the new variance, which is the new mean squared minus the old mean squared, divided by the number of houses.\n\nThe new variance is $130,000^2 - $125,000^2 = $1,690,000,000 - $1,562,500,000 = $127,500,000.\n\nThe new standard deviation is the square root of $127,500,000, which is approximately $30,300.\n\nTherefore, the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city is approximately $30,300.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
