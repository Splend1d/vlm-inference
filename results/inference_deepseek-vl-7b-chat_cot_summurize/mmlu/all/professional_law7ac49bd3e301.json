She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with \"deviate sexual intercourse\", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n",

The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\n\nThe reasoning behind this would be that the state law in question infringes on the fundamental right to privacy, which is protected under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has recognized that the right to privacy includes the right to engage in consensual sexual relations without government interference, as long as the activity is not harmful or otherwise illegal. In this case, the state law criminalizes a private, consensual act between two adults, which violates the right to privacy and substantive due process.\n\nThe other options are not likely to be the holding of the Supreme Court because:\n\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality. This option is not accurate because the Supreme Court has consistently held that the federal constitution can and does interfere with state laws that violate individual rights, such as the right to privacy.\n\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment. This option is not likely because the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and religion, not sexual behavior.\n\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.
