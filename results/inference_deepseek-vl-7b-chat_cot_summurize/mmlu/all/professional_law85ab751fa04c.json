            "content": "In an effort to counteract a steep increase in juvenile crime, a state enacted a law terminating the parental rights of any state resident whose child under 16 years of age is convicted of a violent crime in the state. The law directs the state juvenile court to enter a termination order in such a case after the parent has been afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing at which the only relevant issues are the age of the child and whether the child has been convicted of a violent crime in the state. Is the state law constitutional?\n\nA. No, because the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial state interest.\nB. No, because the law is not necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\nC. Yes, because a state's police power authorizes it to punish criminal behavior with appropriate sanctions.\nD. Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n",
