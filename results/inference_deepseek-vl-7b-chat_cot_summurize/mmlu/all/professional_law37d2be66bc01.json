            "content": "A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game. The fan contacted his best friend and invited him to go to the game. The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following \"modified\" comparative negligence statute:\"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. \"Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of\n\nA. $100,000. 00\nB. $55,000. 00\nC. $45,000. 00\nD. nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.\n",

            "content": "The friend is entitled to recover damages for his injury, but the amount of damages will be reduced by his own percentage of negligence. The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding, and the driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light. Therefore, the friend's recovery will be reduced by 55 percent of his damages.\n\nLet's calculate the amount of damages the friend is entitled to recover:\n\n1. The friend suffered $100,000 in damages.\n2. The friend's percentage of negligence is 55 percent, so his recovery will be reduced by 55 percent of $100,000.\n3. 55 percent of $100,000 is (55/100) * $100,000 = $55,000.\n\nSo, the friend is entitled to recover $100,000 - $55,000 = $45,000.\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of $45,000.00.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $45,000.00.",
