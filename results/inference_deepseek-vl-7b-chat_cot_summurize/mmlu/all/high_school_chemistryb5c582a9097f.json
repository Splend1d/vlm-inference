This means that the reaction will proceed spontaneously without any external energy input.\n\nAt 1 atm and 298 K, the reaction is nonspontaneous, which means that \u0394G > 0. When the system is cooled with dry ice (-78\u00b0C), the reaction becomes spontaneous. This means that \u0394G < 0.\n\nTherefore, the combination that must apply to this reaction is:\n\nC. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0",
