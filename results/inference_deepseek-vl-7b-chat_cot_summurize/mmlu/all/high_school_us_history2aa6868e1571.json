I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did\u2014we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\u2014we only continue the march of the flag?\n\u2014Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" Indianapolis, September 16, 1898\nIn \"The March of the Flag,\" Albert Beveridge supported which of the following?\n\nA. Populism\nB. War with Great Britain\nC. Constitutional reform in the United States\nD. The creation of an American overseas empire\n",

This is evident from the passage where he discusses the ability of different countries to govern foreign lands and suggests that America can do the same. He also emphasizes the idea of expanding American influence and dominion, stating that America only continues the march of the flag by governing new territories. This aligns with the idea of an overseas empire, where a country extends its control and influence over other regions beyond its borders.",
