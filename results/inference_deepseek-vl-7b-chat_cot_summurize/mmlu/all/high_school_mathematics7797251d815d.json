            "content": "The probability that a randomly selected letter out of the 26 letter alphabet will be a vowel is 5/26. Wayne considers \"Y\" to be a vowel, so he considers there are 6 vowels in total. Kristen considers \"Y\" to be a consonant, so she considers there are 5 vowels in total. Therefore, Wayne's probability of selecting a vowel is 6/26, and Kristen's probability is 5/26. The difference between their probabilities is (6/26) - (5/26) = 1/26. To find the percentage, we divide this difference by the common ratio (5/26) and multiply by 100: (1/26) / (5/26) * 100 = 20%.\nThe answer is C.",
