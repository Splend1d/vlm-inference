In this case, the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that she didn't see the color of the light), but rather to show that she made a statement to the investigator. Therefore, the plaintiff's statement to the investigator should be excluded as hearsay.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Excluded, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is hearsay.",
