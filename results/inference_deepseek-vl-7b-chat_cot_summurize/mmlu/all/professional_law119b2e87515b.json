            "content": "At approximately 3:00 p. m. on December 3, a motorist was speeding down a street at the same time that a pedestrian was crossing the street. When the pedestrian started to cross the street, she saw the traffic light was red. She momentarily stopped, thought about waiting until the light turned green, but then decided to cross anyway. As the pedestrian was halfway across the street, the motorist, who was driving 50 m. p. h. in a 25 m. p. h. zone, struck her with his vehicle. The pedestrian suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries in the accident. While in the hospital, the pedestrian's insurance company paid $10,000 of her medical expenses. Six months later, the pedestrian brought suit against the motorist to recover damages for all her medical expenses. This jurisdiction has a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute in effect. Suppose a jury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The motorist was 60 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The pedestrian was 40 percent at fault in crossing the street against the red light; and (3) The pedestrian suffered damages from the accident totaling $50,000. After the verdict, the court was advised that the pedestrian's insurance company had already paid the pedestrian $10,000. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the pedestrian in the amount of\n\nA. $50,000, because the motorist's negligence was greater than the pedestrian's.\nB. $30,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nC. $20,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nD. $10,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, less the $10,000 in hospital expenses already paid by the insurance company.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D. $10,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, less the $10,000 in hospital expenses already paid by the insurance company.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAccording to the special verdict, the motorist was 60 percent negligent in speeding, and the pedestrian was 40 percent at fault in crossing the street against the red light. This means that the motorist is responsible for 60% of the damages, and the pedestrian is responsible for 40% of the damages.\n\nThe pedestrian suffered damages from the accident totaling $50,000. Since the motorist is responsible for 60% of the damages, the pedestrian is responsible for 40% of the damages. Therefore, the pedestrian's damages are $50,000 * 40% = $20,000.\n\nThe pedestrian's insurance company paid $10,000 of her medical expenses. This amount will be disregarded under the collateral source rule, which means that it will not be deducted from the damages awarded to the pedestrian.\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment for the pedestrian in the amount of $20,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence.",
