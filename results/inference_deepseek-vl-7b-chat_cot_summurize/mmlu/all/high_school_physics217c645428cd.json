Neither parallel nor perpendicular to the table.\n\nThe frictional force, f, that opposes the movement of the block is always perpendicular to the surface of the block. This is because friction is the force that opposes relative motion or displacement between two surfaces in contact. Since the force of friction is always perpendicular to the surface of the block, it cannot be parallel or perpendicular to the table. Therefore, the force exerted on the block by the table is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the table.",
