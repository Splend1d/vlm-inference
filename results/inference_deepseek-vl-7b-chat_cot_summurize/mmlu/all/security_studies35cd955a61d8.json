Transnational crime developed as a result of the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities.\nB. TNC as a concept emerged in the academic sphere as linked to human security concerns and developmental opportunities in weak states as a means of conflict resolution and peace building in Europe.\nC. Transnational criminal activities have always been a feature of the international system. In the policy community, the growth of interest in TNC is due to the increasing sophistication of intelligence and communications technology, which has enabled the true representation of the scale and the scope of the problem to be known.\nD. International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.\n",
