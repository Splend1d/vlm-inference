Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the investor sold all 100 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following: \"No lot shall be used except for residential purposes. \" By 2009, the area surrounding the subdivision was rezoned for commercial and business uses. One of the lot owners now decides to operate a small beauty parlor in the basement of her home. In an action by the homeowners in the subdivision to prevent such commercial use, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the residency restriction is no longer enforceable because of the change in the character of the neighborhood surrounding the development.\nB. the residency restriction is no longer enforceable because the area surrounding the development was rezoned for commercial use.\nC. the residency restriction is enforceable, thus preventing any commercial use.\nD. the operation of a beauty parlor would not constitute a violation of the residency restriction.\n",

The rezoning of the area is not the reason why the residency restriction is no longer enforceable. The restriction is based on the use of the lots, not the zoning of the area. The zoning change only affects the potential for commercial use, but it does not change the fact that the lots were originally intended for residential use only.\n\nC. The residency restriction is enforceable, but the court would likely still allow the operation of a beauty parlor in the basement of a home. The restriction is about the use of the lot, not the type of building on the lot. As long as the beauty parlor is not a commercial business (i.e., it is not open to the public and does not generate income), it would not violate the residency restriction.\n\nD. The operation of a beauty parlor would not constitute a violation of the residency restriction. This option is in line with the reasoning in option A. The restriction is about the use of the lot, not the type of building on the lot. As long as the beauty parlor is not a commercial business, it would not violate the residency restriction.",
