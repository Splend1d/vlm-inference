The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.\n\nFor a projectile launched at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the horizontal, the acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up (i.e., towards the ground) and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down (i.e., horizontally).\n\nB. The speed at the top of the trajectory is zero.\n\nThis statement is not true. The speed of the projectile at the top of the trajectory is the maximum speed, which is the horizontal speed multiplied by the sine of the angle (45\u00b0) and the initial vertical speed.\n\nC. The object's total speed remains constant during the entire flight.\n\nThis statement is not true. The total speed of the projectile is the sum of its horizontal speed and its vertical speed. As the projectile moves, both its horizontal and vertical speeds change, so the total speed does not remain constant.\n\nD. The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.\n\nThis statement is not true. The vertical speed of the projectile increases on the way up and decreases on the way down. The vertical speed is the component of the projectile's speed that is in the vertical direction, and it changes as the projectile moves up and down.",
