This number is based on data from the Global Terrorism Database, which is the largest and most comprehensive dataset on global terrorism. The database is maintained by the University of Maryland and covers terrorist incidents from 1970 to the present.\n\nIt is important to note that the number of deaths from terrorism can vary from year to year due to a number of factors, including the number of terrorist incidents, the severity of the attacks, and the effectiveness of security measures. However, the Global Terrorism Database provides a useful starting point for understanding the overall trend in global terrorism-related deaths.",
