We need to calculate this separately.\n\nExpected value over $20,000 = (Probability of award * Award amount) * 40%\n\nExpected value over $20,000 = (0.7 * $100,000) * 0.4\n\nExpected value over $20,000 = $28,000\n\nNow, we add the expected value over $20,000 to the out-of-pocket expenditures.\n\nExpected value to Smith = $85,000 + $28,000\n\nExpected value to Smith = $113,000\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.
