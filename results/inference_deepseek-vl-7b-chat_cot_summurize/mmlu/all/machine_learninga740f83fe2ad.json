Word2Vec is a technique for learning word embeddings, and it does not use the Restricted Boltzman Machine for initialization. Instead, Word2Vec uses the Gaussian distribution to initialize the word embeddings.\n\nStatement 2: The tanh function is a nonlinear activation function.\nThis statement is true. The tanh function is a hyperbolic tangent function that is used as an activation function in neural networks. It is a nonlinear function that maps input values to output values between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
