            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for work:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance \u00d7 cos(\u03b8)\n\nwhere Work is the work done, Force is the applied force, Distance is the distance the box travels, and \u03b8 is the angle between the force and the direction of motion.\n\nFirst, let's find the work done by the constant force. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied, so the work done is:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance \u00d7 cos(\u03b8) = Force \u00d7 5 m\n\nSince the force is constant, we can equate the work done with the change in kinetic energy of the box:\n\n\u0394K = Work\n\n\u0394K = (1/2)mv^2 - (1/2)mv\u2080^2\n\nwhere \u0394K is the change in kinetic energy, m is the mass of the box, v is the final speed, and v\u2080 is the initial speed.\n\nSince the initial speed is 1 m/s and the final speed is 2 m/s, we have:\n\n\u0394K = (1/2)(10 kg)(2 m/s)^2 - (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s)^2\n\n\u0394K = (1/2)(10 kg)(2 m/s^2) - (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s^2)\n\n\u0394K = 10 kg * 1 m/s^2\n\n\u0394K = 10 J\n\nNow, we can equate the work done with the change in kinetic energy:\n\nForce \u00d7 5 m = 10 J\n\nForce = 10 J / 5 m\n\nForce = 2 N\n\nSo, the magnitude of the applied force is 2 N.
