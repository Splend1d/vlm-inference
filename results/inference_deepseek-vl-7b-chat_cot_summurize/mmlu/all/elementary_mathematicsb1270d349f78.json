To find out how many calories are in 1 ounce of ice cream, we can divide 230 by 4:\n\n230 calories / 4 ounces = 57.5 calories per ounce\n\nNow, we can use this information to find out how many calories are in 6 ounces of ice cream:\n\n57.5 calories per ounce * 6 ounces = 345 calories\n\nSo, there are 345 calories in 6 ounces of that ice cream. The correct answer is C. 345.",
