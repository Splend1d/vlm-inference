We can convert the force to newtons (1 kg = 1000 N) and the distance to meters (1 m = 1 m):\n\nForce = 100 kg = 100,000 N\nDistance = 2 m = 2 m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance \u00d7 cos(\u03b8)\nWork = 100,000 N \u00d7 2 m \u00d7 cos(0\u00b0)\nWork = 100,000 N \u00d7 2 m \u00d7 1\nWork = 200,000 J\n\nHowever, this is the work done by the force of gravity, which is not the same as the work done by the crane lifting the crate. The work done by the crane is the force it applies to lift the crate multiplied by the distance it moves the crate. Since the crane is lifting the crate, the force it applies is the weight of the crate (100 kg) and the distance it moves the crate is the height the crate is lifted (2 m).\n\nSo, the work done by the crane is:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance\nWork = 100 kg \u00d7 2 m\nWork = 200 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 500 J.",
