We need to find the mass of the reactant remaining after 58 s.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from seconds to hours:\n\nt = 58 s * (1 h / 3600 s) = 0.001667 h\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the equation:\n\n[A]t = [A]0 * e^(-86 * 0.001667)\n\n[A]t \u2248 0.0500 * e^(-1.23)\n\n[A]t \u2248 0.0500 * 0.00678\n\n[A]t \u2248 0.00339 g\n\nSince the mass of the reactant is conserved, the mass remaining after 58 s is the initial mass of the reactant:\n\nMass remaining = 0.0500 g\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.0500 g",
