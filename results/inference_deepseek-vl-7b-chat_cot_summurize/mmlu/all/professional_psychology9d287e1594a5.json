            "content": "Ethologists, who are concerned with the study of animal behavior, have criticized behaviorist views for several reasons. One of the main criticisms is that behaviorists ignored the innate, built-in biases in learning due to evolution. Ethologists believe that these biases are important to consider when studying animal behavior.\n\nIn addition to this, ethologists also disagreed with the use of the trial-and-error system in behaviorist experiments. The trial-and-error system is a method of learning where an animal or person tries different actions until they find the one that leads to the desired outcome. Ethologists argue that this method does not accurately reflect the way animals learn in the wild, where they often have to make quick decisions based on limited information.\n\nEthologists also disagreed with the use of the operant conditioning principle in behaviorist experiments. Operant conditioning is a method of learning where an action is followed by a consequence, which can either reinforce or weaken the action. Ethologists argue that this method does not accurately reflect the way animals learn in the wild, where they often have to make quick decisions based on limited information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. the use of the operant conditioning principle.",
