This means that we have control over our thoughts, actions, and choices. We can choose to act virtuously or viciously, to think positively or negatively, and to pursue our goals or not.\n\nOn the other hand, things that are not within our power are \"servile and subject to hindrance\" (B. servile and subject to hindrance). This includes external events, other people's actions, and natural forces. We cannot control the weather, the actions of others, or the outcome of events. We can only control our response to these things.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. free and unhindered; free and unhindered.",
