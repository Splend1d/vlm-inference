That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nCrosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.?\n\nA.

            "content": "Crosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to the colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans. This is because the passage discusses the need for a society to increase its productivity to achieve global hegemony, and it mentions that Western Europe accomplished this through exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside its own lands. This aligns with the colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans, which involved the exploitation of these resources and the displacement of native populations. The other options do not directly relate to the exploitation of resources and the achievement of global hegemony.",
