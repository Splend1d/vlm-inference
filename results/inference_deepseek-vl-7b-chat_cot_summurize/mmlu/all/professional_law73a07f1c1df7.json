She sued the landlord for negligence in causing her injuries. The landlord relied on an exculpatory clause in the lease. The clause, set in fine print on the reverse side of the multi-paged, mass-printed, form lease, was a comprehensive, legalistic waiver in which the tenant gave up virtually all of her rights and remedies against the landlord. She responded that the clause was unconscionable and should not be enforced. What will the court most likely rule with respect to the exculpatory clause?\n\nA. This is not a contract for the sale of goods \u0080\u0093 unconscionability is not available with respect to an agreement not covered by the UCC.\nB. The exculpatory clause must be enforced because the tenant voluntarily signed the lease and agreed to its terms instead of choosing another place to live.\nC. The clause is unenforceable because it discriminates against women who are unable to provide their own security.\nD. The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n",
