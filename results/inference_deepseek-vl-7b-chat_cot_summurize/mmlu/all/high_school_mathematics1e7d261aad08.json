Rolling a 1 and a 3 (1+3=4)\n2. Rolling a 2 and a 2 (2+2=4)\n3. Rolling a 3 and a 1 (3+1=4)\n4. Rolling a 4 and a 0 (4+0=4)\n5. Rolling a 5 and a 1 (5+1=6, but we're looking for sums of 4, so this outcome is not successful)\n6. Rolling a 6 and a 0 (6+0=6, same as above)\n\nThere are 5 successful outcomes.\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 5 / 36\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 5 / (36 * 2)\nProbability = 5 / 72\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 4 is 5/72, which is closest to option B.",
