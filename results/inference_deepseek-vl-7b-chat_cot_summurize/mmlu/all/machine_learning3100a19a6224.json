The kernel trick allows us to map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space where the data becomes linearly separable. In this feature space, the 1-NN classifier may perform better than in the original space. However, it's important to note that this is not guaranteed, and the performance depends on the specific dataset and kernel used.\n\nStatement 2: The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM.\n\nThis statement is false. The VC (Vapnik\u2013Chervonenkis) dimension is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm. The VC dimension of a Perceptron is 2, meaning it can classify up to 2 classes without overfitting. On the other hand, the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM is infinite, meaning it can classify an infinite number of classes without overfitting. Therefore, the VC dimension of a Perceptron is larger than that of a simple linear SVM.",
