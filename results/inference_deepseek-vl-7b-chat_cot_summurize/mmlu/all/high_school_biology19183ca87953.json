This similarity suggests that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related than humans and dogs.\n\nThe structure of hemoglobin is highly conserved across species, which means that the amino acid sequence is very similar. This similarity is a strong indicator of common ancestry, suggesting that humans and chimpanzees share a more recent common ancestor than humans and dogs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. humans and chimpanzees are more closely related than humans and dogs.",
