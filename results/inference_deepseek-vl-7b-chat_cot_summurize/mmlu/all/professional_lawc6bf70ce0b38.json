Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial. What is the court's likely ruling?\n\nA. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\nB. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.\nC. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.\nD. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.\n",
