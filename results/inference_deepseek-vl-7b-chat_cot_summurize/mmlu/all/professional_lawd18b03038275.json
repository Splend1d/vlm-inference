H. when he lost control of the car and jumped a curb, striking a woman who was walking along the sidewalk. As a result of the collision, the woman suffered severe internal injuries and fractured both legs. She was hospitalized for 11 months and became permanently disabled. If the defendant is charged with attempted murder, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts.\nB. guilty, because criminal liability is predicated upon the defendant's willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman.\nD. not guilty, because he lost control of the vehicle.\n",

This reckless behavior led to the collision with the woman, causing her severe internal injuries and fractures. The defendant's actions were foreseeable and intended to cause harm, so he should be found guilty of attempted murder.\n\nOption B is incorrect because criminal liability is not solely based on the defendant's willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others. While this is a factor, the defendant's intent is also important.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the defendant's intent is not the only factor in determining criminal liability. Even if the defendant did not intend to kill the woman, his reckless actions still caused her severe injuries and should be held accountable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because losing control of the vehicle does not absolve the defendant of his responsibility for his actions. The defendant's reckless driving and disregard for the safety of others still resulted in the collision and the woman's injuries.",
