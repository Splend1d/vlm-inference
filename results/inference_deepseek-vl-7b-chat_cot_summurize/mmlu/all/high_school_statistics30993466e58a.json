A two-sample t-test with a 5% level of significance will be used to analyze the results. If all else is kept the same, which of the following descriptions of a possible change in procedure is true?\n\nA. Change from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would increase the power of the test.\nB. Change from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would increase the power of the test.\nC. Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test.\nD. Increasing the sample size would reduce the probability of a Type I error.\n",
