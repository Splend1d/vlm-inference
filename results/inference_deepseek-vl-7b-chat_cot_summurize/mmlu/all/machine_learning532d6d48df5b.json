It uses precision, but not recall. Recall is a measure of the number of relevant items that were retrieved, while precision is a measure of the number of retrieved items that were relevant.\n\nHidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models that are often used to model the probability distribution of a sequence of events. They are frequently used to model the structure of sentences in natural language processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and machine translation.",
