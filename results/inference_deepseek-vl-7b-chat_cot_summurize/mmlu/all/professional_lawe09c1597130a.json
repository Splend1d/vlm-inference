As they reached the car, a defendant, who was visibly intoxicated, emerged from behind a trash can and approached them. The defendant knocked the brother to the ground and hit him over the head with a trash can, causing the brother to lose consciousness. The defendant then forced the sister into the car and raped her. The defendant is charged with assault with intent to commit rape, based on his attack on the brother. The defendant's best defense would be which of the following statements?\n\nA. Although the sister was only 15 years old, she appeared to be 16 years old to a reasonable man.\nB. The defendant did not intend to rape the sister.\nC. The defendant's intoxication at the time negated the required general intent.\nD. It is impossible to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator because the parking lot was dimly lit.\n",

            "content": "The defendant's best defense would be option B. The defendant did not intend to rape the sister. This is because the defendant's actions leading up to the assault, such as knocking the brother to the ground and hitting him over the head with a trash can, suggest that his intent was to incapacitate the brother, not to sexually assault the sister. The fact that he forced the sister into the car and raped her is a separate, additional act that does not necessarily negate the claim that he did not intend to rape her.",
