The work done to stretch the first spring is given by the formula:\n\nW1 = -kx\n\nSince it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half this distance, the work done to stretch the second spring is:\n\nW2 = -k(x/2)\n\nNow, we can equate the work done to stretch the two springs:\n\nW1 = 2 * W2\n\nSubstitute the expressions for W1 and W2:\n\n-kx = 2 * (-k(x/2))\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n-kx = -k(x)\n\nDivide both sides by -k:\n\nx = x\n\nSince the distance is the same for both springs, the force constant of the second spring must be equal to the force constant of the first spring:\n\nk\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. k",
