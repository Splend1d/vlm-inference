            "content": "The correct answer is B. It is constitutional because Congress can demonstrate that such a subsidy is rationally related to a legitimate public interest.\n\nThe question is about the constitutionality of a federal appropriation to an education fund dedicated to promoting mass transportation as an alternative to automobiles, which the fund considers a major source of pollution. The statute taxing the sale of automobiles and appropriating the proceeds for the education fund is considered an inseverable portion of the same law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question does not involve a subsidy to a museum. Option C is incorrect because the question does not involve an equitable apportionment among the states. Option D is incorrect because the question does not involve a welfare benefit only to those interested in clean air.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because the appropriation is rationally related to a legitimate public interest, which is the education of the public about the importance of mass transportation as an alternative to automobiles. This is a legitimate public interest because it promotes public health and welfare by reducing pollution.",
