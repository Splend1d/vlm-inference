An anti-symmetric relation would have no pairs like (1, 2) or (2, 1), but S does have (1, 2). Therefore, S is neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric.\n\nHowever, S is an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The relation S is reflexive because for every element in A, there is a corresponding element in S (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3). The relation S is symmetric because if (a, b) is in S, then (b, a) is also in S. The relation S is not transitive because (1, 1) is not in S, even though 1 = 1.\n\nSo, the relation S is an equivalence relation, which means it is both symmetric and anti-symmetric. Therefore, the answer is C.",
