            "content": "To determine the H+ concentration in a phenol solution, we can use the Bronsted-Lowry acid-base theory. According to this theory, phenol (C6H5OH) can act as both an acid and a base. When phenol acts as an acid, it releases a proton (H+) from its -OH group.\n\nThe Ka (acid dissociation constant) for phenol is 1 \u00d7 10^-10 M. The Ka is a measure of the equilibrium constant for the acid dissociation reaction:\n\nC6H5OH + H2O \u21cc C6H5OH- + H+\n\nSince the Ka is 1 \u00d7 10^-10 M, we can assume that the phenol is completely dissociated in the solution. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of phenol, which is 1 M (1 \u00d7 10^-3 M).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1 \u00d7 10^-3 M",
