This is because the Kirkwood gaps are created by the resonance between the orbital periods of the asteroids and the gravitational influence of Jupiter. The period of an asteroid in its orbit around the Sun is determined by its semi-major axis, which is inversely proportional to its orbital period. When an asteroid's orbital period is a multiple of the orbital period of Jupiter, it will experience a resonance with Jupiter's gravitational influence, causing it to be scattered into a gap in the asteroid belt. The Kirkwood gaps are the regions in the asteroid belt where the asteroid orbits have a period half that of Jupiter.",
