He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:\"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. \"Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n",

            "content": "The man's letter does not explicitly state that he is renouncing the contract or repudiating it. He is merely informing the swimming club of his inability to use the pool due to injuries sustained in an accident. Therefore, he has not yet breached the contract. The swimming club cannot sue him immediately for breach of contract because he has not yet failed to fulfill his obligations under the contract.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.",
