            "content": "One day, an 11-year-old boy came home from school with red lipstick stains on his collar. When the boy's mother inquired about the lipstick stains, the boy said that his teacher had kissed him. The mother then contacted the police, who subsequently conducted an investigation and arrested the teacher, charging her with two felony counts of child molestation. In accord with state law, a preliminary hearing was scheduled. After the boy was subpoenaed to testify at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution filed a motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance. The motion, with supporting affidavits from a child psychologist, claimed that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. The judge should\n\nA. deny the motion, because a pretrial proceeding is an early stage of trial, and a defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at every stage of the trial.\nB. deny the motion, because the teacher's exclusion from the courtroom would have prejudicial impact on receiving effective assistance of counsel.\nC. grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.\nD. grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking what the judge should do in a situation where the prosecution wants to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance at a preliminary hearing. The prosecution's motion is based on the claim that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Denying the motion would mean allowing the teacher to be present during the boy's testimony. This could potentially cause emotional harm to the boy, which is the concern of the prosecution. However, the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of confrontation at every stage of the trial. This means that the defendant has the right to be present during the trial, including the preliminary hearing. Therefore, denying the motion could be seen as a violation of the defendant's rights.\n\nB. Denying the motion could also be seen as prejudicial to the teacher's right to effective assistance of counsel. If the teacher is not present during the boy's testimony, the teacher's attorney may not be able to effectively cross-examine the boy or prepare a defense. This could potentially harm the teacher's defense.\n\nC. Granting the motion would mean excluding the teacher from the courtroom. This would potentially cause emotional harm to the boy, which is the concern of the prosecution. However, the teacher's attorney would still have the opportunity to cross-examine the boy, even if the teacher is not present. This could potentially be an effective way to challenge the boy's testimony.\n\nD. Granting the motion would mean excluding the teacher from the courtroom. This would potentially cause emotional harm to the boy, which is the concern of the prosecution. However, the Sixth Amendment does not require cross-examination at a preliminary hearing. Therefore, denying the motion could be seen as a violation of the defendant's rights.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is C. Granting the motion would mean excluding the teacher from the courtroom, which could potentially cause emotional harm to the boy, but it would also allow the teacher's attorney to cross-examine the boy, which could potentially be an effective way to challenge the boy's testimony.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
