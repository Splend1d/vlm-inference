However, we can try to find the roots by factoring or using numerical methods.\n\nAfter solving the quartic equation, we find that the roots are approximately y = 0.8187 and y = -0.8187.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the equation of the circle to find the corresponding x values:\n\nFor y = 0.8187:\n\nx^2 = 1 - (0.8187)^2 = 1 - 0.6531 = 0.3469.\n\nFor y = -0.8187:\n\nx^2 = 1 - (-0.8187)^2 = 1 - 0.6531 = 0.3469.\n\nBoth of these values are the same, so they correspond to the same point on the circle.\n\nNow, we can check the other options:\n\nA. x^2 + y^2 = 1: This is the equation of the circle we found, so it has 2 points of intersection with the parabola.\n\nB. x^2 + y^2 = 2: This is not a circle, so it does not intersect the parabola.\n\nC. x^2 + y^2 = 9: This is not a circle, so it does not intersect the parabola.\n\nD. x^2 + y^2 = 16: This is not a circle, so it does not intersect the parabola.\n\nTherefore, the circle A has the greatest number of points of intersection with the parabola x^2 = y + 4.",
