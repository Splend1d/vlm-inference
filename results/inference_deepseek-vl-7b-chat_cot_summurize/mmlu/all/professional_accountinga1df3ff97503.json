The formula for NPV is:\n\nNPV = \u03a3 [CFi / (1 + r)^i]\n\nwhere:\n- CFi is the cash inflow at time i\n- r is the discount rate (in decimal form)\n- i is the time period (in years)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- Cash inflows: $3,000 per year for 5 years\n- Initial investment: $11,000\n- Discount rate: 10% (0.10)\n\nLet's calculate the NPV:\n\n1. Calculate the present value of the cash inflows:\n\nPV = CF / (1 + r)^i\nPV = $3,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5\nPV = $3,000 / 1.10^5\nPV = $3,000 / 1.4641\nPV \u2248 $2,000\n\n2. Calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = \u03a3 [PVi / (1 + r)^i]\nNPV = $2,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 + $2,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 + $2,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 + $2,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 + $2,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5\nNPV \u2248 $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641\nNPV \u2248 $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641 + $2,000 / 1.4641\nNPV \u2248 $11,370\n\nSo, the net present value is approximately $11,370.
