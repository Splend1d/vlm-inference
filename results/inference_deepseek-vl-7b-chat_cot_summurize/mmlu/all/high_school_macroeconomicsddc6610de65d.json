This is done to reduce inflation, lower the general price level, and increase the interest rates.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase\nThis option suggests that all variables will increase. However, a contractionary monetary policy is designed to decrease the money supply, which would typically lead to a decrease in aggregate demand and output, and an increase in the price level.\n\nB. Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase\nThis option suggests that all variables will decrease. This is consistent with the effects of a contractionary monetary policy, as it reduces the money supply, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand and output, and an increase in the price level.\n\nC.
