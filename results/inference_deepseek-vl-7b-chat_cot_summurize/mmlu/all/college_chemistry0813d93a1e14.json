In square planar complexes, the ligands are arranged in a square, and the isomers can be formed by changing the orientation of the central metal atom with respect to the plane of the ligands. If all four ligands are identical, there will be no isomerism. However, if the ligands are different, then the complex can display optical isomerism.",
