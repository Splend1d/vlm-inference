Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Nonsampling risk is the risk that the auditor's conclusions may be different if the auditor had tested each item in the population instead of using a sample. This risk is not specific to nonissuer entities.\n\nB. Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This risk is not specific to nonissuer entities.\n\nC. Sampling risk is the risk that arises from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. This risk is not specific to nonissuer entities.\n\nD. Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This risk is specific to nonissuer entities because the auditor must consider the nature and complexity of the entity's transactions and the auditor's professional judgment when selecting audit procedures.",
