            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative speed and the time difference between the two observers.\n\nLet's denote the speed of light as c. According to the first observer O, the two sources of light flash simultaneously. This means that the time difference between the two sources of light is 0.\n\nNow, let's denote the speed of the second observer O' as v. According to the second observer O', one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. This means that the time difference between the two sources of light is 13 ns.\n\nSince the speed of light is constant, we can use the formula:\n\nv = c * (13 ns) / (10 m)\n\nNow, we need to find the speed of O' relative to O. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv_relative = v - c\n\nSubstituting the value of v from the previous equation, we get:\n\nv_relative = (c * (13 ns) / (10 m)) - c\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nv_relative = (13 ns) / (10 m)\n\nTo convert the time difference to meters, we can use the formula:\n\n13 ns = 13 * 10^(-9) s = 13 * 10^(-9) * (1000 m/s) = 1300 * 10^(-9) m\n\nNow, we can calculate the speed of O' relative to O:\n\nv_relative = (1300 * 10^(-9) m) / (10 m) = 130 * 10^(-9) m/s\n\nTo convert this speed to units of speed, we can use the formula:\n\nv_relative = (130 * 10^(-9) m/s) / (1000 m/s) = 0.013 m/s\n\nNow, we can convert this speed to units of speed relative to the speed of light:\n\nv_relative = 0.013 m/s * (1000 m/s) / (1000 m/s) = 0.013 m/s\n\nSo, the speed of O' relative to O is 0.013 m/s.
