            "content": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.\nIn the given expression, the highest power of $x$ is $x^3$ in the first term and $x^3$ in the second term, so the degree of the polynomial is $3+3=6$.\nHowever, the degree of the polynomial resulting from the expansion is $2$, which means that the highest power of $x$ in the expanded form is $x^2$.\nThis means that the term $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ must have a degree of $3$.\nSince the degree of the term $(px+q)$ is $1$, the degree of the term $(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ must be $2$.\nTherefore, the term $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ must have a degree of $2$.\nThis means that the term $(px+q)$ must have a degree of $1$.\nTherefore, $p+q$ must be equal to the degree of the term $(px+q)$, which is $1$.\nTherefore, $p+q=\\boxed{D}$.\nThe answer is: 1",
