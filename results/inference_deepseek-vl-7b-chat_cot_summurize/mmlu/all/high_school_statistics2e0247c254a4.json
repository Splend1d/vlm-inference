The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents. As a result, which of the following will happen?\n\nA. The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nB. The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nC. The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nD. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.\n",

            "content": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. The original mean price of the kiosk is $14.75.\n2. The kiosk owner increases the prices by 50 cents.\n3. The new mean price will be the original mean price plus the increase, which is $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25.\n\nNow, let's consider the range of prices:\n\n1. The original range of prices is from $3.99 to $29.99.\n2. The kiosk owner increases the prices by 50 cents.\n3. The new range of prices will be the original range plus the increase, which is ($3.99 + $0.50) to ($29.99 + $0.50).\n\nNow, let's consider the standard deviation:\n\n1. The original standard deviation is not given, but we can assume it's positive since the prices are in dollars.\n2. The kiosk owner increases the prices by 50 cents.\n3. The new standard deviation will be the original standard deviation plus the increase, which is positive + $0.50.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{A}}$.",
