The speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the piano string as x Hz.\n\nThe beats per second (BPS) is given as 3.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n3 = (x - 1134) * 343\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3 = 343x - 38028\n343x = 38028\nx = 38028 / 343\nx \u2248 110.9 Hz\n\nHowever, the options given are not close to 110.9 Hz. This means that there is an error in the problem statement or the given information is not sufficient to solve the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. More information is needed",
