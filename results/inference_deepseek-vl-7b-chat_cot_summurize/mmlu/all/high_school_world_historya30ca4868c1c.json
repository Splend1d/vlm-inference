It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\n\nA.

            "content": "The excerpt from \"Germania\" by Publius Cornelius Tacitus provides evidence of several aspects of Roman society. However, the question asks for the view that is best seen as evidence of one of the given options.\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples: The excerpt does express a certain disdain for the barbarian peoples, particularly the Tencteri, Bructeri, Chamavi, and Angrivarii. Tacitus refers to them as \"barbarians\" and describes their actions as \"tyranny\" and \"extermination.\" This suggests a sense of disgust or contempt for these peoples.\n\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks: While Tacitus does mention the actions of the barbarian peoples against the Roman Empire, the excerpt does not specifically express concern about barbarian attacks. Instead, it focuses on the actions of the Roman Empire and its relationship with the neighboring tribes.\n\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy: The excerpt does not provide any information about the presence or absence of Stoicism among the Roman aristocracy.\n\nD. Maintenance of large armies: The excerpt does not specifically mention the maintenance of large armies in Roman society.\n\nBased on the information provided in the excerpt, the view that is best seen as evidence of Roman society is the Disgust for barbarian peoples. Therefore, the answer is A.",
