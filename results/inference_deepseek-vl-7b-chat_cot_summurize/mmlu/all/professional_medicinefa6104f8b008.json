Two days ago he developed a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He has received all scheduled childhood immunizations. He attends a large day-care center and has three schoolaged siblings. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 38/min, and blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows nasal flaring and rhinorrhea. Chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi. The infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has which of the following properties?\n\nA. DNA genome\nB. Double-stranded nucleic acid genome\nC. Mature virion lacking viral polymerase\nD. Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is B. Double-stranded nucleic acid genome.\n\nThis question is related to the field of virology, specifically the properties of viruses. The patient's symptoms, including fever, cough, nasal discharge, and rapid breathing, are consistent with a viral infection. The presence of intercostal retractions, bilateral, diffuse wheezes, and expiratory rhonchi on physical examination suggests a respiratory tract infection, which is a common feature of viral infections.\n\nA. DNA genome: This is not the most likely property of the infectious agent because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a viral infection, which typically has a double-stranded RNA genome.\n\nB. Double-stranded nucleic acid genome: This is the most likely property of the infectious agent because it is common for respiratory viruses to have a double-stranded RNA genome.\n\nC. Mature virion lacking viral polymerase: This is not the most likely property of the infectious agent because mature virions typically contain the genetic material of the virus, which includes the polymerase.\n\nD. Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein: This is not the most likely property of the infectious agent because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a viral infection, which typically uses a receptor-mediated endocytosis for cell entry.\n\nTherefore, the infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has a double-stranded nucleic acid genome.",
