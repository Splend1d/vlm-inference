            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the law of total probability. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the event occurring in each of the possible ways that the event can occur.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker. Each allele has a frequency of 0.2, so the probability of an individual having one of these alleles is 0.2. Since the alleles are independent, the probability of an individual having both alleles is the product of the probabilities of having each allele:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\nHowever, this is the probability of having both alleles, not the probability of carrying two specific alleles. To find the probability of carrying two specific alleles, we need to consider the different ways that this can occur. There are two possible ways:\n\n1. The individual has one allele from each allele type (AA or BB).\n2. The individual has two alleles of the same type (AA or BB).\n\nFor the first case, the probability is the product of the probabilities of having one allele from each allele type:\n\nP(AA or BB) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\nFor the second case, the probability is the product of the probabilities of having two alleles of the same type:\n\nP(AA or BB) = P(A) * P(A) + P(B) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.2 + 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.08\n\nNow, we can add the probabilities of the two cases to find the total probability:\n\nP(AA or BB) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of carrying two specific alleles by dividing the total probability by the sum of the frequencies of the two alleles:\n\nP(AA or BB) / (0.2 + 0.2) = 0.12 / 0.4 = 0.3\n\nSo, the probability of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, will be 0.3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",
