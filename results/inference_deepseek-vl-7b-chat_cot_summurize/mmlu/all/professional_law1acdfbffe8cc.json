            "content": "A consumer watchdog group presented petitions to the state legislature bearing the signatures of over 10,000 state residents complaining about the recent increases in the cost of cable television. A corporation who provides cable television services successfully persuaded the state legislature to grant it an exclusive right to install cable television lines in all multiple family dwellings in the state, in exchange for the corporation's promise to freeze cable television rates for the next four years. An owner of several large multifamily apartment buildings in the state brought an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state legislation. The suit claimed that the space used by the corporation when it subsequently installed cable television lines in one of his apartment buildings amounted to a taking without compensation. In this action, the owner will be awarded\n\nA. no relief, because easements for utility lines are presumed to be beneficial to the servient estate.\nB. no relief, because the legislation is merely a regulation of the use of property and not a taking.\nC. no relief, because the corporation is not a government entity.\nD. damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D. damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n\nThe owner of the apartment buildings is challenging the constitutionality of the state legislation, claiming that the space used by the corporation when it installed cable television lines in one of his buildings amounted to a taking without compensation. In this case, the owner would be awarded damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n\nA. This answer is incorrect because the presumption of easements being beneficial to the servient estate does not apply in this situation. The owner is not arguing that the easement is beneficial, but rather that it is a taking without compensation.\n\nB. This answer is incorrect because the legislation is indeed a regulation of the use of property, and the owner is challenging its constitutionality.\n\nC. This answer is incorrect because the corporation is a private entity, not a government entity. The issue here is not about the corporation being a government entity, but about the constitutionality of the legislation.",
