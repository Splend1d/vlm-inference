            "content": "The correct answer is B. The market price on September 15.\n\nThe question states that the seller decided not to deliver the widgets to the buyer on September 15 due to a worldwide shortage of widgets. This means that the market price of widgets would have increased significantly by September 15 compared to September 1. Therefore, the market price on September 15 would be taken as the market price of widgets when determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled.\n\nA. The market price on September 1: This would not be considered as the market price of widgets because the seller had already decided not to deliver the widgets by then.\n\nC. The market price on September 20: This would not be considered as the market price of widgets because the buyer only received the seller's letter on September 20, which was after the seller had decided not to deliver the widgets.\n\nD. The market price on September 30: This would not be considered as the market price of widgets because the buyer filed a lawsuit against the seller on October 15, which was after the delivery date of September 30.\n\nTherefore, the market price of widgets would be taken as the market price on September 15.",
