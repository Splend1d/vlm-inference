The agreement calls for an interest rate of 10% on fund used, a 15% compensating balance, and a commitment fee of 1% on the unused amount of the credit line. Assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained, the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year is closest to\n\nA. 11.5 percent.\nB. 15 percent.\nC. 26.5 percent.\nD. 13.53 percent.\n",

            "content": "To calculate the effective annual interest cost, we need to consider the interest on the borrowed amount, the compensating balance, and the commitment fee.\n\n1. Interest on the borrowed amount: $200,000 x 10% = $20,000\n2. Compensating balance: $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000\n3. Commitment fee on the unused amount: $300,000 x 1% = $3,000\n\nNow, we add up these three amounts:\n\n$20,000 (interest on borrowed amount) + $3,000 (commitment fee) + $30,000 (compensating balance) = $63,000\n\nThe effective annual interest cost is the total interest paid plus the commitment fee, divided by the borrowed amount:\n\n$63,000 / $200,000 = 0.315\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.315 x 100 = 31.5%\n\nSo, the effective annual interest cost is closest to 31.5%. However, since the options are not in whole percentages, we can round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
