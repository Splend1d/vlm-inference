This means that her testimony is considered as a business record and can be used in court.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the television correspondent's testimony is not based on firsthand knowledge. She recorded the opponent's statement, not personally witnessing it.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the notebook entry is not the best evidence. The best evidence rule states that the original document or object is the best evidence, not a copy or record of it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the television correspondent's testimony is not hearsay. Hearsay is a statement made out of court that is offered as evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The television correspondent's testimony is based on her personal recollection of the opponent's statement, not on a statement made by someone else.",
