            "content": "To find the frequency of the vertical component, we can use the formula:\n\nFrequency_vertical = Frequency_horizontal * |tan(\u03b8)|\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle of the vertical component.\n\nWe are given that there are 5 horizontal tangencies and 2 vertical tangencies. The horizontal tangency angle is 180 degrees, so the angle of the vertical component is:\n\n\u03b8 = 180 - (5 * 90) = 30 degrees\n\nNow we can find the frequency of the vertical component:\n\nFrequency_vertical = 100 Hz * |tan(30 degrees)|\n\nThe tangent of 30 degrees is 0.577, so:\n\nFrequency_vertical = 100 Hz * 0.577 \u2248 57.7 Hz\n\nHowever, the frequency of a wave cannot be negative. Since the tangent of 30 degrees is positive, we can take the absolute value:\n\nFrequency_vertical = 57.7 Hz\n\nSo the frequency of the vertical component is approximately 57.7 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 625 Hz.",
