Veronica reads 200 words per page.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of words in the novel.\n\nTotal number of words = Number of pages * Number of words per page\nTotal number of words = 400 * 200\nTotal number of words = 80,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it will take Veronica to read the entire novel.\n\nTime = Total number of words / Number of words per minute\nTime = 80,000 / 250\nTime = 320 minutes\n\nSo, to the nearest minute, it will take Veronica approximately 320 minutes to read the entire novel.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 320",
