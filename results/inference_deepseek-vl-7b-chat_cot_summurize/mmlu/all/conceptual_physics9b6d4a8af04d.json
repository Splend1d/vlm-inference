The primary (input) coil of a step-up transformer is connected to the low voltage source, while the secondary (output) coil is connected to the high voltage load. The magnetic flux linkage in the transformer's core increases as the number of turns in the secondary coil increases, resulting in a higher voltage on the secondary side. This allows the transformer to step up the voltage from the low voltage source to a higher voltage that can be used to power the high voltage load. The transformer does not step up the energy in the circuit, as the energy is conserved and remains constant throughout the circuit.",
