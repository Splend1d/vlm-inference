It is enforceable, because the employer was morally obligated to pay the bonus.\nC. It is unenforceable, because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\nD.

In this case, the employee's negotiation of the lucrative contract was the consideration given by the employee to the employer. However, the employer's promise to pay the $10,000 bonus was not a legally sufficient consideration because it was not tied to any specific performance or result by the employee. The employer could have promised the bonus regardless of the employee's performance, making it an unenforceable promise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. It is unenforceable, because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.",
