            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for work done on an object:\n\nW = F * d\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force, and d is the distance.\n\nIn this case, the force is the acceleration due to gravity (which is constant at 9.81 m/s^2) and the distance is the change in velocity, which is the final speed minus the initial speed.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour, so:\n\n0.6 c = 0.6 * (1000 km/km) * (3600 s/h) = 21600 m/h\n\nNow, we can find the change in velocity:\n\nv_final - v_initial = 21600 m/h\n\nSince the particle starts at rest, its initial velocity is 0 m/h. Therefore:\n\nv_final = 21600 m/h\n\nNow, we can find the work done:\n\nW = F * d = 9.81 m/s^2 * (21600 m/h) = 2131200 J\n\nNow, we need to convert this work to joules (the unit of work):\n\n2131200 J = 2131200 * 1 J = 2131200 J\n\nFinally, we can find the work done on the particle:\n\nW = 0.60mc^2\n\nSo, the answer is B.",
