The enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break a mole of a substance into its constituent elements in their most stable forms at a standard temperature and pressure (25\u00b0C and 1 atm, respectively).\n\nMgO (magnesium oxide) has an enthalpy of formation of -133 kJ/mol.\nMgS (magnesium sulfide) has an enthalpy of formation of -113 kJ/mol.\nNaF (sodium fluoride) has an enthalpy of formation of -110 kJ/mol.\nNaCl (sodium chloride) has an enthalpy of formation of -110 kJ/mol.\n\nComparing the enthalpies of formation, MgO has the greatest lattice enthalpy among the given options.",
