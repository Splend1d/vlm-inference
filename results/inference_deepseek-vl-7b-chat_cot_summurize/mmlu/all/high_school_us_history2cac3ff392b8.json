The women, dissatisfied as they are with this form of government, that enforces taxation without representation,\u2014that compels them to obey laws to which they have never given their consent,\u2014that imprisons and hangs them without a trial by a jury of their peers, that robs them, in marriage, of the custody of their own persons, wages and children,\u2014are this half of the people left wholly at the mercy of the other half, in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this government, every one of which was based on the immutable principle of equal rights to all.\"\n\u2014Susan B.

            "content": "The question is asking which of the given options was NOT designed to empower the government to regulate the increasing wealth and power of the industrialists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nA. Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890): This act was designed to prevent monopolies and to break up trusts, which were large groups of businesses that controlled a market and often exploited consumers and workers. This would help regulate the increasing wealth and power of industrialists.\n\nB. Interstate Commerce Act (1887): This act was designed to regulate the transportation of goods between states, which was a significant part of the industrial economy at the time. This would also help regulate the increasing wealth and power of industrialists.\n\nC. Federal Trade Commission Act (1914): This act was designed to regulate unfair business practices, such as price fixing and monopolistic practices. This would help regulate the increasing wealth and power of industrialists.\n\nD. Newlands Reclamation Act (1902): This act was designed to encourage irrigation and the development of arid lands in the western United States. While it may have had some impact on the economy, it was not specifically designed to regulate the increasing wealth and power of industrialists.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Newlands Reclamation Act (1902).",
