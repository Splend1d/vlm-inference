            "content": "To find the intrinsic value of the call option, we need to calculate the difference between the market price of the stock and the exercise price of the option.\n\nThe market price of the stock is $10 per share, and the exercise price of the option is $9 per share. Therefore, the intrinsic value of the call option is:\n\nIntrinsic value = Market price - Exercise price = $10 - $9 = $1\n\nSo, the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment is $1.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the initial investment, we need to consider the premium paid for the option. The premium is the difference between the market price and the exercise price of the option.\n\nPremium = Market price - Exercise price = $10 - $9 = $1\n\nTherefore, the initial investment of $200 includes the premium of $1.\n\nTo find the intrinsic value of the call option, we need to subtract the premium from the initial investment:\n\nIntrinsic value = Initial investment - Premium = $200 - $1 = $199\n\nSo, the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment is $199.\n\nHowever, the options are not available in this format. Therefore, the closest answer is:\n\nA. $50",
