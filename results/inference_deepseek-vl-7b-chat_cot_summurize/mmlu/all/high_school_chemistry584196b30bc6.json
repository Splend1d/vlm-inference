The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 35 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n",

The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained. This is not necessarily true. The sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because its temperature change was greater.\n\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water. This is not necessarily true. The change in temperature does not directly relate to the heat capacity (CP) of the sample. Heat capacity is a property of the material and depends on its mass, volume, and specific heat capacity, not just the temperature change.\n\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased. This is not necessarily true. The total energy of the system can increase or decrease depending on the heat transfer between the sample and the water. In this case, the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained, so the total energy of the system decreased.",
