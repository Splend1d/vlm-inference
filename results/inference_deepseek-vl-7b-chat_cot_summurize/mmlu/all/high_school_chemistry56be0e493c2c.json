            "content": "The ion-electron method is used to balance chemical equations involving ionic compounds. It involves adding or subtracting electrons to achieve a balanced charge on both sides of the equation.\n\nLet's analyze each of the given options:\n\nA. BaCl2 + Al2(SO4)3 \u2192 AlCl3 + BaSO4\nThis equation involves ionic compounds, but the reaction is not an ionic reaction. Therefore, the ion-electron method cannot be used to balance this equation.\n\nB. H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O\nThis equation involves an acid (H+) and a base (OH-), which react to form water (H2O). The ion-electron method cannot be used to balance this equation, as it is a neutralization reaction.\n\nC. NaOH + H3PO4 \u2192 Na2HPO4 + H2O\nThis equation involves an alkoxide (NaOH) and a phosphoric acid (H3PO4), which react to form a phosphonate (Na2HPO4) and water (H2O). The ion-electron method can be used to balance this equation.\n\nD. C2H2(g) + N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g)\nThis equation involves gaseous compounds, but the reaction is not an ionic reaction. Therefore, the ion-electron method cannot be used to balance this equation.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C is the only equation that can be balanced using the ion-electron method.",
