            "content": "The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) is a United States federal law that addresses the ethical issues surrounding the excavation, study, and display of human remains and cultural items from Native American tribes and Alaskan Native communities. The law aims to protect these cultural resources and to return them to their original tribes or communities for proper care and cultural reburial.\n\nThe problems often arise when:\n\nA. both non-indigenous archaeologists and Native Americans are allowed onto the site at the same time. This can lead to disagreements and conflicts over the interpretation of the site and the handling of the remains.\n\nB. there are no Native Americans who have been trained as archaeologists and no archaeologists who are Native American. This can lead to a lack of cultural understanding and sensitivity in the archaeological process, as well as a lack of cultural knowledge and expertise in the interpretation of the remains.\n\nC. neither archaeologists nor Native Americans can agree on the exact location of burials at the site. This can lead to disagreements over the proper treatment of the remains and the cultural significance of the site.\n\nD. burials are so ancient that establishing historical or genealogical connections with modern, living groups of people is impossible. This can lead to debates over the cultural and historical significance of the remains and the proper treatment of the remains.\n\nOverall, the problems that arise with the ethics of conducting archaeological research on sites with human remains of indigenous North American ancestors are complex and multifaceted, and require careful consideration and collaboration between archaeologists, Native American communities, and other stakeholders.",
