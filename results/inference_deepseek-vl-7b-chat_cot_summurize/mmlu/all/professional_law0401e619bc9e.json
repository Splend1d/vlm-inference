Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, \"You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?\" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is\n\nA. admissible as non-hearsay.\nB. admissible, even though it is hearsay.\nC. admissible under the excited utterance exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.\n",
