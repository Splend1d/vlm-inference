The gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h, and it was recorded by a camera on a platform 200 meters away traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. If the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800Hz, what is the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at?\n\nA. 941 Hz\nB. 787 Hz\nC. 924 Hz\nD. 912 Hz\n",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the speed of sound and the relative motion between the sound source and the sound receiver.\n\nThe speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second (1,125 feet per second) at room temperature.\n\nThe actor inside the car is traveling at 108 km/h, which is equivalent to 108,000 meters per hour.\n\nThe camera on the platform is traveling at 72 km/h, which is equivalent to 72,000 meters per hour.\n\nThe relative motion between the sound source and the sound receiver is the difference in their velocities. In this case, the relative motion is 108,000 - 72,000 = 36,000 meters per hour.\n\nTo find the perceived frequency, we need to convert the relative motion to meters per second and then divide by the speed of sound.\n\nPerceived frequency = (Relative motion in meters per second) / Speed of sound\nPerceived frequency = 36,000 / 343\nPerceived frequency \u2248 104.7 Hz\n\nNow, we need to convert this perceived frequency back to Hertz.\n\nPerceived frequency in Hertz = 104.7 Hz\n\nSo, the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at is approximately 104.7 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 787 Hz.",
