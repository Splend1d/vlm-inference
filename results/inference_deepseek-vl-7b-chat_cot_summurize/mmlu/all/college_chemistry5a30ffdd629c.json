HBr(g) \u2192 H+(g) + Br\u2212(g).\n\nThe dissociation energy is the energy required to break a chemical bond. In this case, the bond is between hydrogen and bromine. The reaction B shows the dissociation of a hydrogen-bromine bond, with the formation of hydrogen ions and bromine ions. The enthalpy change (DH) for this reaction is the dissociation energy.\n\nThe other reactions do not involve the dissociation of a hydrogen-bromine bond. Reaction A shows the formation of hydrogen gas and bromine gas from hydrogen bromide, which is not the dissociation of a bond. Reaction C shows the formation of hydrogen bromide from hydrogen gas and bromine gas, which is the reverse of the dissociation reaction. Reaction D shows the formation of hydrogen gas and bromine gas from hydrogen bromide, which is also not the dissociation of a bond.",
