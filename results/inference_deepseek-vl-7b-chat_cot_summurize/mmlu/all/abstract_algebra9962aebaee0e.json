In this case, we are working in the polynomial ring Z_8[x], which means that all coefficients are integers modulo 8.\n\nThe product of f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 is:\n\n(4x - 5)(2x^2 - 4x + 2) = 8x^3 - 16x^2 + 8x - 10x + 10 = 8x^3 - 16x^2 + 2x - 10\n\nNow, we need to find the product modulo 8:\n\n8x^3 - 16x^2 + 2x - 10 \u2261 0 (mod 8)\n\nWe can simplify the polynomial by dividing by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients, which is 1:\n\n8x^3 - 16x^2 + 2x - 10 \u2261 0 (mod 8)\n\nNow, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 8 and 1:\n\ngcd(8, 1) = 1\n\nSince the gcd is 1, the polynomial is divisible by 1. Therefore, the product of the two polynomials is 0 (mod 8):\n\n8x^3 - 16x^2 + 2x - 10 \u2261 0 (mod 8)\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0",
