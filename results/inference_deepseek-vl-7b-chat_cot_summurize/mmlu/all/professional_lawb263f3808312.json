            "content": "A resident in an exclusive residential area is a marine biologist. To aid in his study of sharks, he had a large tank built in his backyard in which he placed a great white shark. Aside from a smell that emanated from the tank, some neighbors were concerned and afraid to let their children outside for fear that they would wander onto the resident's property. In order to convince his neighbors that they had nothing to fear, the resident invited them over to view the shark tank. While a neighbor was standing near the tank, the shark splashed its tail, and the neighbor got very wet. The neighbor, who had a cold, developed bronchitis. If the neighbor sues the resident for damages incurred from being drenched by the shark and bases her suit on strict liability, she will most likely\n\nA. recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.\nB. recover, because the smell from the shark tank was a nuisance.\nC. not recover, because she suffered injury only because she had a cold and, therefore, was unusually vulnerable to harm from being splashed with water.\nD. not recover, because she did not suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark.\n",

In this case, the neighbor was drenched by the shark's tail, and as a result, she developed bronchitis. Since the resident is the possessor of the great white shark, and the shark caused the neighbor's injury, the resident is strictly liable for the damages incurred.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The smell from the shark tank was not a nuisance, but rather a concern for the safety of the neighbors and their children.\n\nC. The neighbor's vulnerability to harm from being splashed with water is not a valid defense for the resident, as the resident is still strictly liable for the harm caused by the great white shark.\n\nD. The type of harm inflicted by the shark (drenching the neighbor with water) is not a valid defense for the resident, as the resident is still strictly liable for the harm caused by the great white shark.",
