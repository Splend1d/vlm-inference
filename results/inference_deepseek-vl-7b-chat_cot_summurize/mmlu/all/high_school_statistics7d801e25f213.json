Last week he examined the teeth of five unrelated children younger than 10. Let X be the number of children who develop cavities before turning 10. Which of the following gives the probability that at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10?\n\nA. P(X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\nB. P(X = 2 out of 7)\nC. P(X = 1)\nD. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0)\n",

            "content": "The probability that at least one child will develop a cavity before turning 10 can be calculated by finding the probability that none of the children develop cavities and subtracting it from 1.\n\nThe probability that none of the children develop cavities is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 children), k is the number of successful trials (in this case, 0 cavities), p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.2 or 20% since 2 out of 7 children develop cavities), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nC(5, 0) = 1 (since there's only one way to choose 0 cavities out of 5 children)\n\np = 0.2\n\nP(X = 0) = 1 * (0.2)^0 * (1-0.2)^(5-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.8)^5 \u2248 0.13437697\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one child will develop a cavity before turning 10:\n\nP(X \u2265 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.13437697 \u2248 0.86562303\n\nSo, the probability that at least one child will develop a cavity before turning 10 is approximately 0.8656 or 86.56%.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 1 - P(X = 0).",
