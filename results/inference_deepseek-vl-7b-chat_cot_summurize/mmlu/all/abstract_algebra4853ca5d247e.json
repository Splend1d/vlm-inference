In a group, the operation of squaring (i.e., raising to the power of 2) is an example of an operation that is associative. This means that for any elements a and b in the group, a^2 is equal to b^2 if and only if a is equal to b.\n\nStatement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nThis statement is also true. A dihedral group is a group that consists of symmetries of a regular polygon, including rotations and reflections. The set of rotations in a dihedral group is indeed a cyclic subgroup, as it can be generated by a single rotation.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
