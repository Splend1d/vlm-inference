An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\nA. P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nB. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nC. P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\nD. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n",

            "content": "The P-value of a one-sample t-test is given by the formula:\n\nP(t > t_critical) = P(Z > |t_critical|)\n\nwhere t_critical is the critical value for the given level of significance (alpha) and degrees of freedom (df), and Z is the Z-score.\n\nIn this case, the level of significance (alpha) is 0.05, and the degrees of freedom (df) are the sample size minus 1, which is 7 - 1 = 6. The critical value for a one-tailed t-test with alpha = 0.05 and df = 6 is approximately 1.54.\n\nNow, we need to find the Z-score corresponding to this critical value. The Z-score is given by:\n\nZ = (t - t_critical) / sqrt((df/2) * (1 - (alpha/2)))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nZ = (300 - 1.54) / sqrt((6/2) * (1 - (0.05/2)))\nZ = (298.46) / sqrt(3 * 0.95)\nZ = 298.46 / sqrt(2.85)\nZ \u2248 298.46 / 2.85\nZ \u2248 104.9\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of getting a Z-score greater than 104.9, which is the same as finding the probability of getting a t-score greater than 1.54. This is given by the formula:\n\nP(t > 1.54) = P(Z > 104.9)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability of getting a Z-score greater than 104.9 is approximately 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
