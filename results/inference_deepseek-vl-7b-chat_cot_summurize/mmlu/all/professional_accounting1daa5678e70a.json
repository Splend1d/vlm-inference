The difference between these two values is the gain on the land exchange:\n\nGain on land exchange = $50,000 - $20,000 = $30,000\n\nThe fair value of the machinery is $55,000.\n\nSince the transaction has commercial substance, we can assume that the gain on the exchange is the difference between the fair value of the machinery and the cost of the machinery:\n\nGain on exchange = $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000\n\nSo, the gain on the exchange is $5,000, which corresponds to option B.",
