This principle, named after Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, states that if light passes through a transparent medium, the light waves will undergo a series of phase changes as they interact with the medium's particles. These phase changes are described by the wave nature of light, rather than its particle nature (which is described by the photoelectric effect and other phenomena). Therefore, the correct answer is A. waves.",
