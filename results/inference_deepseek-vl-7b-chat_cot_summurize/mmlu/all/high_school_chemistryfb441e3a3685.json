            "content": "The molar solubility of a compound is the maximum number of moles of solute that can be dissolved in a solvent without any change in the chemical properties of the solute. The Ksp (Kinetic Solubility Product) of a compound is a measure of the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of the compound in a solvent.\n\nThe Ksp of Iron(III) hydroxide is 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39. This means that at equilibrium, the concentration of Iron(III) hydroxide in a solution is 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39 mol/L. This is the maximum concentration of Iron(III) hydroxide that can be dissolved in a solvent without any change in the chemical properties of the solute.\n\nTherefore, the molar solubility of Iron(III) hydroxide is 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39 mol/L.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 7.4 \u00d7 10^-14 mol/L",
