Plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar, for it exercises judgment and provides language intake, whereas formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant. Politics more than pedagogy retards the changing of the curriculum to fit this truth. The author of the passage above argues that\n\nA. using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar\nB. good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar\nC. analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking\nD. formal study of grammar improves writing ability\n",

The author argues that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar, as it exercises judgment and provides language intake. The author also states that formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant. \n\nOption A suggests that using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar. This aligns with the author's argument that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar.\n\nOption B suggests that good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar. The author does not explicitly state that formal grammar study improves judgment, so this option is not entirely accurate.\n\nOption C suggests that analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking. While the author does mention that formal grammar study exercises judgment, they do not specifically mention logical thinking.\n\nOption D suggests that formal study of grammar improves writing ability. The author does not explicitly state that formal grammar study improves writing ability, so this option is not entirely accurate.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the author's argument is most closely aligned with option A. Therefore, the answer is A.",
