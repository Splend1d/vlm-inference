The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase.\n\nThis is because the marginal product of the 3rd worker (MP3) is 10, which means that for every additional dollar the firm invests in the 3rd worker, it will receive a return of 10 dollars. This indicates that the 3rd worker is highly productive and the firm should hire more labor to increase its return on investment.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. Hiring more labor would increase the MP, not decrease it.\nC. Hiring less labor would decrease the MP, not increase it.\nD. Hiring less labor would decrease the MP, not increase it.",
