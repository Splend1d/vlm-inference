            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated by a black body at temperature T is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. The proportionality constant is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, denoted as \u03c3.\n\nThe energy radiated by a black body at temperature T is given by:\n\nE = \u03c3T^4\n\nNow, let's consider the situation where the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two. The new temperature is T' = 2T. The energy radiated by the cavity at this new temperature is:\n\nE' = \u03c3(2T)^4 = 16\u03c3T^4\n\nThe mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is proportional to the energy radiated by the cavity. Therefore, if the energy radiated is increased by a factor of 16, the mass of ice that can be melted will also be increased by a factor of 16.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 16.",
