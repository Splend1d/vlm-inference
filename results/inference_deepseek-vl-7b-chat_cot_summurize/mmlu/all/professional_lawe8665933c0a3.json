The head of the department has promulgated the following hiring rule: \"Because the rich are the source of all problems of society and cannot understand the plight of the poor, anyone who has a net worth over $10,000.00 is ineligible for employment with this department.\" Immediately, 25 employees in the department are fired due to their net worth above the designated level. They sue the state. Which of the following is the correct analysis and conclusion?\n\nA. The action is arbitrary and capricious, so it is unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny standard.\nB. The action is not deemed done by a state actor because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function.\nC. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\nD. Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny.\n",

            "content": "The correct analysis and conclusion in this case would be:\n\nC. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\n\nThis is because the employees were fired based on a rule that disproportionately affects a specific group (those with a net worth over $10,000.00) without any due process. This can be seen as a violation of the employees' property interest in their jobs and could potentially lead to a successful lawsuit against the state.\n\nA. This option is incorrect because the action is not arbitrary and capricious. The rule is based on a specific policy goal of wealth redistribution, which is a legitimate government function.\n\nB. This option is incorrect because the action is indeed done by a state actor, as the Farstate Department of Wealth Equality is a state agency.\n\nD. This option is incorrect because the rule does not need to meet a high level of scrutiny. While wealth redistribution is an important governmental function, it is not a quasi-suspect class, which would require a higher level of scrutiny. The rule is based on a specific policy goal and does not disproportionately affect a specific group.",
