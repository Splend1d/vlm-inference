However, this action does not affect the reserve requirement, which is five percent. Therefore, the amount of money that banks are required to hold as reserves remains unchanged at $50 million.\n\nSince the reserve requirement is five percent, banks are required to hold 5/100 * $50 million = $2.5 million in reserves. This means that banks have $50 million - $2.5 million = $47.5 million available for lending.\n\nWhen the FED sells $10 million worth of government securities, it reduces the amount of money available for lending by $10 million. This reduction in the amount of money available for lending can potentially lead to an increase in the money supply by $10 million, as banks now have $47.5 million + $10 million = $57.5 million available for lending.\n\nTherefore, the money supply can potentially increase by $200 million (since $10 million is a fraction of the total money supply).",
