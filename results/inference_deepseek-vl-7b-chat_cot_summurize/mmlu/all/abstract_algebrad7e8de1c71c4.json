            "content": "Statement 1: For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|. (G + H is the internal direct product.)\n\nThis statement is true. The internal direct product of two groups G and H, denoted by G + H, is the set of all ordered pairs (g, h) where g is in G and h is in H. The group operation is defined component-wise, i.e., (g1, h1) + (g2, h2) = (g1 + g2, h1 + h2). The order of a group is the number of elements in the group, and the direct product of two groups is the Cartesian product of their orders. Therefore, |G + H| = |G||H| by definition.\n\nStatement 2: If r divides m and s divides n then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.\n\nThis statement is false. The group Z_m + Z_n is the direct sum of the groups Z_m and Z_n, and it is not necessarily isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. The isomorphism between Z_m + Z_n and Z_r + Z_s depends on the specific divisors r and s of m and n, and it is not guaranteed that such an isomorphism exists.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
