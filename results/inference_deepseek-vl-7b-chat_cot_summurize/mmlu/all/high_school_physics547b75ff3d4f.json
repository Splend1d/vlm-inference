            "content": "The weight of an object is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the center of mass of the object. In this case, the astronaut is moving from Earth to the planet, so the distance from the center of mass of the planet is the same as the distance from the center of mass of Earth.\n\nThe mass of the planet is twice that of Earth, so its radius is also twice that of Earth. Therefore, the radius of the planet is 2 * 6371 km = 12742 km.\n\nThe mass of the planet is 2 * (6371 km)^2 = 12742 km^2.\n\nThe weight of the astronaut on the planet is equal to the mass of the astronaut divided by the mass of the planet:\n\nWeight on planet = (mass of astronaut) / (mass of planet) = (800 N) / (12742 km^2) \u2248 0.064 N/km^2.\n\nThe weight of the astronaut on the planet is 0.064 N/km^2 * 12742 km^2 = 800 N.\n\nTherefore, the astronaut will weigh 800 N on this planet.
