According to the definition of limits, if the sequence {s_n} converges to a complex number s, then the sequence {s_nt_n} also converges to st. This is because the product of two complex numbers is still a complex number, and the product of a complex number and a sequence converges to the product of the limit and the limit of the sequence.\n\nStatement 2: False, True\n\nThis statement is false. There does not exist a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. This is because the set of real numbers is complete, meaning that every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number. Therefore, there cannot be a sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence.",
