The operation in this ring is component-wise addition, i.e., (a1, a2) + (b1, b2) = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2).\n\nThe characteristic of a ring is a number that, when multiplied by the identity element of the ring, gives the multiplicative identity of the ring. In the case of Z x Z, the identity element is the pair (0, 0), and the multiplicative identity is the pair (1, 1). Therefore, the characteristic of Z x Z is 0, as 0 * 0 = 0.",
