            "content": "The limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume (C_V) of a gas-phase diatomic molecule can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nC_V = R * T\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor a diatomic molecule, the average heat capacity (C_V) is given by:\n\nC_V = 2 * R * T\n\nAt high temperatures, the average heat capacity approaches the limiting value, which is twice the gas constant (R). Therefore, the limiting high-temperature molar heat capacity at constant volume (C_V) of a gas-phase diatomic molecule is:\n\nC_V = 2 * R = 2 * 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K = 16.628 J/mol\u00b7K\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3.5R",
