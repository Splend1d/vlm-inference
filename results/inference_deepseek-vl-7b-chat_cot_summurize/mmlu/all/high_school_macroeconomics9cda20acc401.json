Required reserves\n\nRequired reserves are considered a liability because they are funds that the bank is required to keep on hand as a cushion to cover potential losses and meet regulatory requirements. These reserves are held in a reserve account at the central bank and are not available for lending or other uses.\n\nB. Excess reserves\n\nExcess reserves are not considered a liability because they are funds that the bank has above and beyond the required reserves. These reserves are held in a reserve account at the central bank and are available for lending and other uses.\n\nC. Loans\n\nLoans are considered an asset because they represent funds that the bank has lent to customers and are expected to be repaid over time.\n\nD. Deposits\n\nDeposits are considered a source of funds for the bank, not a liability. Deposits are funds that customers have placed with the bank and are available for the bank to use for lending and other purposes.",
