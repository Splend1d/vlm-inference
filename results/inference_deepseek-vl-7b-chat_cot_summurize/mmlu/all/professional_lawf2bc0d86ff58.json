The federal statute in question allows for claims under the statute to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. Since the state court has the jurisdiction to hear the case, it should not be dismissed to a federal court. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. This option suggests that state courts must abstain in cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue. However, the federal statute allows for claims to be brought in state courts, so there is no need for abstention.\n\nC. This option suggests that state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law. While it is true that state courts should not discriminate against federal cases, the question does not provide any evidence of discrimination in this case.\n\nD. This option suggests that the parties cannot proceed in federal court since there is no diversity of citizenship. However, the question does not mention any requirement for diversity of citizenship, so this is not a valid reason for the state court to hear the case.",
