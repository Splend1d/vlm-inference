The covenants of seisin and right to convey are not personal to the farmer, as they are not rights that the farmer has or can transfer. The third covenant, against encumbrances, is also not personal to the farmer, as it is a right that the farmer has to prevent the buyer from being evicted by a woman with paramount title. Therefore, the buyer has a valid claim against the farmer for breach of covenants in the deed.",
