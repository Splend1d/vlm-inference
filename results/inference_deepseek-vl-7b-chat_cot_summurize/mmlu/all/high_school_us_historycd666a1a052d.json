Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nGeraldine Ferraro can be most directly compared to which of the following women?\n\nA.

            "content": "Geraldine Ferraro can be most directly compared to Abigail Adams. Both women were significant figures in American politics, advocating for women's rights and equality. Abigail Adams was the wife of the second President of the United States, John Adams, and played a crucial role in shaping the nation's policies and values. She was a strong supporter of education and women's rights, and her letters to her husband provide insight into the political climate of the time.\n\nSandra Day O'Connor, a Supreme Court Justice, is more directly related to the legal system and judicial decisions. Jane Addams was a social worker and activist who founded the Hull-House in Chicago, which provided services and support to immigrants and the working class. Rosa Parks is best known for her role in the civil rights movement, refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger, which sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nWhile all of these women made significant contributions to American society, Geraldine Ferraro's focus on women's rights and equality, as well as her role in politics, most closely aligns with Abigail Adams.",
