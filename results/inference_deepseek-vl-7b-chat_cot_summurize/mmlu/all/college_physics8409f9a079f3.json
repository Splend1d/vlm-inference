            "content": "To find the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the kinetic and potential energies.\n\n1. Kinetic energy: The mass has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. Since the mass is moving horizontally, we can use the kinetic energy formula:\n\nK = (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the speed.\n\nK = (1/2)(0.30 kg)(0.040 m/s)^2\nK = (1/2)(0.30 kg)(0.016 m^2/s^2)\nK = 0.00084 mJ\n\n2. Potential energy: The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position. We can use the potential energy formula:\n\nPE = mgh\n\nwhere PE is the potential energy, m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height (0.030 m).\n\nPE = (0.30 kg)(9.81 m/s^2)(0.030 m)\nPE = 0.02943 mJ\n\n3. Total mechanical energy: The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n\nE = K + PE\nE = 0.00084 mJ + 0.02943 mJ\nE = 0.03887 mJ\n\nSince the answer choices are in mJ (millijoules), we can convert the total mechanical energy to mJ:\n\nE = 0.03887 mJ * (10^3) mJ/mJ\nE = 3.887 mJ\n\nThe closest answer choice is B. 0.38 mJ.",
