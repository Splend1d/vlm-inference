            "content": "Let's denote the surface area of the cube as $S$. Since the amount of paint is directly proportional to the surface area, we can write the equation $S \\cdot \\frac{16}{S} = 169$. Simplifying this equation, we get $16S = 169$. Dividing both sides by 16, we find that $S = 11$.\n\nThe surface area of a cube is given by $S = 6s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side. Substituting $s = \\sqrt{11}$ into this equation, we find that the surface area of the cube is $6\\left(\\sqrt{11}\\right)^2 = 6 \\cdot 11 = 66$.\n\nTherefore, the cube that David can cover with 169 quarts of paint has a side length of $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{2}}$ feet.\nThe answer is: \\frac{13}{2}",
