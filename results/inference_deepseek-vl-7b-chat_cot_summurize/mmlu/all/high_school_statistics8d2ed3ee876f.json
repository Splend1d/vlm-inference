            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (hurricanes) in n trials (cyclones)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success (hurricane) in a single trial (cyclone)\n- n is the number of trials (cyclones)\n- k is the number of successes (hurricanes)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 5 (cyclones)\n- k = 3 (hurricanes)\n- p = 0.51 (probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(5, 3), which is the number of ways to choose 3 hurricanes out of 5 cyclones:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\nC(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.51)^3 * (1-0.51)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.51)^3 * (0.49)^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.01287 * 0.1601\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.02101\nP(X = 3) = 0.2101\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of at least 3 hurricanes:\n\nP(X \u2265 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2) - P(X = 3)\nP(X \u2265 3) = 1 - (0.51)^5 * (1-0.51)^(5-5)\nP(X \u2265 3) = 1 - (0.51)^5 * (0.49)^0\nP(X \u2265 3) = 1 - (0.51)^5 * 1\nP(X \u2265 3) = 1 - 0.03689\nP(X \u2265 3) = 0.96311\n\nNow, we can compare the probabilities:\n\nP(X \u2265 3) = 0.96311\n\nThe closest answer is:\n\nD. 0.658",
