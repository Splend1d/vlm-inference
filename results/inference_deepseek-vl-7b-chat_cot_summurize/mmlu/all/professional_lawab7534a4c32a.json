As they were leaving, one of the co-defendants inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. At common law, the co-defendants should be found guilty of\n\nA. burglary and arson.\nB. larceny and arson.\nC. larceny only.\nD. burglary, larceny, and arson.\n",

Burglary: The co-defendants broke into the warehouse, which is considered a burglary if they entered the building with the intent to commit a crime.\n\n2. Larceny: The co-defendants stole the appliances, which is considered larceny if they took the property without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it.\n\n3. Arson: The co-defendants intentionally allowed the fire to spread, which is considered arson if they willfully and maliciously set fire to the building or property.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Arson is not mentioned in the scenario, so the co-defendants cannot be found guilty of this crime.\n\nB. Larceny is mentioned in the scenario, but the co-defendants are not charged with arson, so they cannot be found guilty of both crimes.\n\nC. The co-defendants are not charged with larceny only; they are also charged with burglary and arson.",
