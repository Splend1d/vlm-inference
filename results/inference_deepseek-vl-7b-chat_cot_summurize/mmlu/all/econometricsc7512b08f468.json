            "content": "The value of $R^2$ for an estimated regression model is exactly zero when the model is not able to explain any of the variability of the dependent variable (y) about its mean value. This means that the regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value.\n\nWhen $R^2$ is zero, all coefficient estimates on the slopes are not necessarily zero. They can be any real number.\n\nThe fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables when $R^2$ is zero. This is because the regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value.\n\nThe intercept coefficient estimate must not be zero. This is because the intercept is the value of y when all the explanatory variables are zero. If the intercept were zero, it would mean that the mean value of y is zero, which is not possible in a real-world scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).",
