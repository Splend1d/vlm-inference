A state law was subsequently passed requiring the city to prepare a general plan governing both land use and open-space development. The city's plan, with new density requirements, effectively limited development of the five-acre lot to a total of one to five single family residences. The partnership sued the city, asking for a declaratory judgment that the city had taken its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The partnership lost at the local and appellate levels. The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case \u0080\u0094 what did it decide?\n\nA. This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.\nB. This was an unlawful taking without prior notice and therefore unconstitutional.\nC.
