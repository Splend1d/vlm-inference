            "content": "Police received reliable information that a homeowner had a stolen x-brand stereo in his possession. The detectives then submitted an affidavit to a neutral magistrate setting forth sufficient underlying circumstances for the issuance of a search warrant. Making a determination of probable cause, the magistrate issued a warrant for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address. The police arrived at the homeowner's dwelling, showed him the warrant, and came inside. In the living room, they noticed a y-brand stereo, which had the serial number removed. Upon further inspection, the police determined that the stereo had been stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary. Thereupon, the police placed the homeowner under arrest and instructed him to remain seated in the living room while they searched the rest of the home. One of the officers proceeded to the basement where she found the stolen x-brand stereo. She then decided to search the upstairs and came upon a stolen z-brand stereo in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom. The homeowner was subsequently prosecuted for receiving stolen property. At trial, the homeowner moves to prevent introduction of the stereos into evidence. His motion should be granted with respect to\n\nA. the y-brand stereo.\nB. the z-brand stereo.\nC. the y-brand and the z-brand stereos.\nD. none of the stereos.\n",

            "content": "The homeowner's motion to prevent the introduction of the stereos into evidence should be granted with respect to the y-brand stereo. This is because the y-brand stereo was found in the living room, and the police determined that it had been stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary. The homeowner had no legal right to possess this stereo, as it was stolen property.\n\nThe z-brand stereo, on the other hand, was found in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom, and the police did not have sufficient evidence to link it to the homeowner. Therefore, the homeowner should not be prosecuted for receiving this stereo.\n\nAs for the x-brand stereo, the police had probable cause to issue a search warrant for it, and the homeowner was arrested for possessing it. Therefore, the homeowner should not be prosecuted for receiving this stereo.\n\nIn conclusion, the homeowner's motion to prevent the introduction of the y-brand stereo into evidence should be granted, while the motion should be denied for the z-brand and x-brand stereos.",
