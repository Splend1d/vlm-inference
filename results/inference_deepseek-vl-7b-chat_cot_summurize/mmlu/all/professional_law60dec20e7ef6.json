A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?\n\nA. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.\nC. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n\nThe question is about a state labor code that prohibits employers from employing aliens who are not lawfully residing in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful residents' right to work. The immigrant farm workers are bringing a lawsuit against the labor contractors who are refusing to employ them, even though they are lawfully residing in the United States.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply here because the statute is not discriminatory. It applies to all employers, not just to the immigrant farm workers.\n\nB. The Eleventh Amendment does not apply here because the statute is not a regulation of immigration. It is an economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n\nC. The preemption argument is incorrect because the federal government has not preempted the state's right to regulate the employment of illegal aliens. The federal government has the right to regulate immigration, but it has not said that states cannot regulate the employment of illegal aliens.",
