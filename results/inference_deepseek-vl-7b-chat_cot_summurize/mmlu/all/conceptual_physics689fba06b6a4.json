Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nF = k * q1 * q2 / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force between the two particles, q1 and q2 are the charges of the particles, k is the constant of proportionality (which is the same for all charges and is approximately 9 \u00d7 10^9 N m^2/C^2), and r is the distance between the particles.\n\nIf the particles are twice as close to each other, the distance r is halved. Therefore, the force between them is also halved. So, the correct answer is:\n\nC. half as strong",
