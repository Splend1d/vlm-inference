This implies that he does not accept the moral principle that \"ought implies can.\"\n\nThe principle \"ought implies can\" states that if something ought to be done, then it is possible to do it. In other words, if there is a moral obligation to do something, then it is possible for someone to do it. Nagel's belief in genuine moral dilemmas suggests that he does not believe this is always the case, as there are situations where it is not clear what the right thing to do is.\n\nTherefore, Nagel denies the moral principle that \"ought implies can.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. can implies ought.",
