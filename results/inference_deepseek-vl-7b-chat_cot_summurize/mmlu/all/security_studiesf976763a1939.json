War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.\nB. War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\nC. War is more likely when the offence-defence balance of the international system favours offence, thus creating a more competitive environment for states.\nD. All of these options.\n",

While the balance of offense and defense can influence the likelihood of war, a realist would argue that the balance of power is not the sole determinant of war. Other factors, such as state interests, power politics, and the balance of coercion, also play a significant role.",
