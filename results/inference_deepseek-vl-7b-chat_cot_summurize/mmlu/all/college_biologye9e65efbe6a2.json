Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; secondary phloem; primary phloem; cortex.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe larvae would first encounter the pith, which is the central part of the twig containing the vascular tissues. They would then move into the primary xylem, which is the xylem that is closest to the pith. After that, they would move into the secondary xylem, which is the xylem that is further away from the pith.\n\nNext, they would encounter the vascular cambium, which is the tissue that produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem. The larvae would then move into the secondary phloem, which is the phloem that is closest to the vascular cambium.\n\nFinally, they would encounter the primary phloem, which is the phloem that is further away from the vascular cambium. The outermost tissue that the larvae would encounter is the cortex, which is the outer layer of the xylem and phloem.",
