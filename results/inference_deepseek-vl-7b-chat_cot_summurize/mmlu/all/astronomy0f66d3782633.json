            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of angular size and the relationship between angular size and distance in the field of astronomy.\n\nThe angular size of the rock is given as 0.5 degrees, which is equivalent to 30 pixels. We can use the formula:\n\nangular size = (object's diameter) / (distance to the object)\n\nSince the diameter of the rock is not given, we can assume it to be 5 cm (as given in the problem). Now, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the distance:\n\ndistance = (object's diameter) / (angular size)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ndistance = (5 cm) / (0.5 degrees)\n\nTo convert degrees to radians, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 degree = \u03c0/180 radians\n\nSo, 0.5 degrees = \u03c0/360 radians\n\ndistance = (5 cm) / (\u03c0/360)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\ndistance = (5 cm) * (360/\u03c0)\n\ndistance \u2248 180 cm\n\nTo convert centimeters to meters, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 cm = 0.01 m\n\nSo, the distance is approximately 1.8 meters.\n\nHowever, the options provided are in feet. To convert meters to feet, we can use the conversion factor:\n\n1 m = 3.281 feet\n\nSo, the distance is approximately 5.8 feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. About 6 feet.",
