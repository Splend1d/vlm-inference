This is because the intersection of two subspaces can have a dimension that is less than, equal to, or greater than the dimensions of the individual subspaces. If the dimensions of V and W are both 2, then the intersection will have a dimension of 2. If one of the dimensions is 1, then the intersection will have a dimension of 1. If neither of the dimensions is 1, then the intersection will have a dimension of 0. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",
