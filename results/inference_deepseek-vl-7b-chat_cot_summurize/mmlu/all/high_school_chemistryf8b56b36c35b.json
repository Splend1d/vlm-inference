            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the stoichiometry of the reaction between the metal and HCl. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nMetal + HCl \u2192 Hydrogen gas + Metal chloride\n\nWe are given that 0.0623 grams of metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen at STP. To find the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid, we need to determine the number of moles of hydrogen produced.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the volume of hydrogen produced to moles. Since 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L at STP, we can convert the volume of hydrogen produced to moles using the following equation:\n\nMoles of hydrogen = Volume of hydrogen / Volume of gas at STP\nMoles of hydrogen = 28.3 mL / 22.4 L\nMoles of hydrogen \u2248 1.25 moles\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid. The balanced chemical equation tells us that 1 mole of hydrogen gas is produced for every mole of metal chloride. Therefore, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is equal to the mass of one mole of metal chloride.\n\nThe mass of one mole of metal chloride is given by the molar mass of the metal chloride. For example, the molar mass of sodium chloride (NaCl) is 58.5 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is:\n\nMass of metal = Molar mass of metal chloride * Number of moles of metal chloride\nMass of metal = 58.5 g/mol * 1.25 moles\nMass of metal \u2248 73.125 g\n\nHowever, this mass is not an integer, which means that the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is not a whole number. This is likely due to rounding errors in the calculations. To find the closest whole number, we can round the mass of the metal to the nearest whole number:\n\nMass of metal \u2248 73.1 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is approximately 73.1 grams. The closest whole number is 73.1 g, so the answer is:\n\nB. 493 g",
