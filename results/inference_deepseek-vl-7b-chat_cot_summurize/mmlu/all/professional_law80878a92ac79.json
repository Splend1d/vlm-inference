The homeowner then gives an investor a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the investor to the homeowner in the amount of $80,000. The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property. In a foreclosure proceeding in which the friend, the investor, and the bank were parties, the property sold for $160,000. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided \"unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. \"What dollar amount, if any, should go to the friend?\n\nA. $0. 00\nB. $30,000. 00\nC. $80,000. 00\nD. $100,000. 00\n",

            "content": "The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the recording statute. The recording statute does not apply to the foreclosure proceeding, but rather to the recording of mortgages and other instruments affecting title to land. In a foreclosure proceeding, the court determines the priority of the liens and distributes the proceeds of the sale among the lien holders in accordance with the priority of their liens.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner gave the friend a mortgage for $100,000, which was recorded before the investor's mortgage for $80,000. Therefore, the friend's mortgage has priority over the investor's mortgage. The homeowner also gave the bank a mortgage for $50,000, which was recorded after the investor's mortgage, so the bank's mortgage has priority over the investor's mortgage.\n\nSince the friend's mortgage has priority over the investor's mortgage, the friend would receive the entire amount of the sale, which is $160,000. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $0.00",
