Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nThe ideas expressed above were influenced by which of the following?\n\nA. Widespread prosperity in the 1920s\nB. Widespread economic hardship in the 1920s\nC. The rapid growth of the welfare state in the 1920s\nD. Highly publicized antitrust prosecutions\n",

            "content": "The ideas expressed in the passage are most closely related to the context of widespread economic hardship in the 1920s. The text emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of individuals to their own property and industry, and criticizes a government that imposes taxes without a clear need or sound public policy. This suggests that the author was concerned about the negative impact of economic conditions on individual freedoms and the stability of the government.\n\nOption A, Widespread prosperity in the 1920s, does not align with the author's focus on the negative effects of taxation and the potential for tyranny. Option C, The rapid growth of the welfare state in the 1920s, is not mentioned in the passage and does not seem to be a significant influence on the author's ideas. Option D, Highly publicized antitrust prosecutions, is not mentioned in the passage and does not seem to be a significant influence on the author's ideas.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is B, Widespread economic hardship in the 1920s. This option aligns with the author's focus on the negative impact of taxation and the potential for tyranny, and suggests that the author was concerned about the negative effects of economic conditions on individual freedoms and the stability of the government.",
