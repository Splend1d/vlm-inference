These are experiences that embody the virtues and provide a concrete sense of what it means to possess them. Aristotle believed that virtues are not just ideas or concepts, but are actual qualities that can be seen and felt in human behavior. Therefore, he believed that understanding the virtues requires experiencing them in action, rather than just knowing about them through conventional use or a thick description of the virtue. The role of tradition is also important for Aristotle, but it is not the primary way in which he fixed the reference of each virtue term.",
