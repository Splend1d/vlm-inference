RoBERTa, developed by Facebook AI, is an improved version of BERT. It was trained on a larger corpus, which is approximately 10 times larger than the corpus used to train BERT. This larger corpus allowed RoBERTa to achieve better performance on various natural language processing tasks.\n\nStatement 2: ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.\nThis statement is false. ResNeXts, a type of neural network architecture, was introduced in 2016, not in 2018. Additionally, ResNeXts typically use rectified linear units (ReLU) activation functions, not tanh. ReLU is a popular choice for its computational efficiency and performance in many tasks.",
