            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. We can do this by finding the range of waiting times for 100,000 riders and then finding the shortest time interval within that range.\n\nFirst, let's find the range of waiting times for 100,000 riders. We can use the standard deviation to do this. The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data, and it is equal to the square root of the variance. The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution, the variance is equal to the mean, so the standard deviation is \u221a(35^2) = 5.\n\nNow, we can find the range of waiting times for 100,000 riders. Since the standard deviation is 5, the range is 5 * \u221a(100,000) = 5 * \u221a(10^4) = 5 * 100 = 500 minutes.\n\nNow, we need to find the shortest time interval within this range. We can do this by finding the smallest interval that contains all the waiting times. Since the waiting times are normally distributed, the smallest interval will be the one that contains the smallest 10% of the waiting times.\n\nTo find the smallest 10% of the waiting times, we can use the z-score formula: z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the waiting time, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. The z-score represents the number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean.\n\nFor the smallest 10% of waiting times, the z-score will be less than -1. This means that the waiting times will be less than 35 - 5 = 30 minutes.\n\nNow, we can find the shortest time interval within the range of 500 minutes that contains the waiting times less than 30 minutes. The smallest interval that contains all the waiting times less than 30 minutes will be the smallest interval that contains the waiting times less than 25 minutes.\n\nThe smallest interval that contains the waiting times less than 25 minutes is 25 to 35 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is 25 to 35 minutes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
