If the price of firm A's service rises by 5%, it will likely lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded for firm B's service, as consumers may choose to switch to a cheaper alternative. This is an example of price elasticity of demand, which measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price.",
