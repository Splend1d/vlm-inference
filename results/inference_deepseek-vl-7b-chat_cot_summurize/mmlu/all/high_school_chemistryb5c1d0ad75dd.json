            "content": "To find the equilibrium concentration of BrCl, we can use the equilibrium constant (K) and the initial concentrations of the reactants. The equilibrium constant (K) is given as 15.0 at a certain temperature. The initial concentrations of Br2 and Cl2 are not provided, so we cannot directly use the equilibrium constant to find the equilibrium concentration of BrCl.\n\nHowever, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the equilibrium concentration of BrCl. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\nBr2(g) + Cl2(g) \u21cc 2 BrCl(g)\n\nThe balanced chemical equation tells us that for every 1 mole of Br2 and Cl2, 2 moles of BrCl are formed at equilibrium.\n\nGiven that there are 10.0 grams of BrCl initially, we can convert this to moles using the molar mass of BrCl (197.1 g/mol):\n\n10.0 g * (1 mol/197.1 g) = 0.052 mol\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the equilibrium concentration of BrCl:\n\n0.052 mol * 2 = 0.104 mol\n\nThe initial volume of the reaction vessel is 15.0 L, which is equal to 15000 cm^3. We can convert the moles of BrCl to moles per cm^3 using the initial volume:\n\n0.104 mol * (15000 cm^3 / 1000 g) = 15.42 mol/L\n\nFinally, we can convert the moles per liter to moles per mol/L:\n\n15.42 mol/L * (1 mol/1 mol) = 15.42 mol/L\n\nThe concentration of BrCl at equilibrium is approximately 15.42 mol/L, which is equal to 1.97 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
