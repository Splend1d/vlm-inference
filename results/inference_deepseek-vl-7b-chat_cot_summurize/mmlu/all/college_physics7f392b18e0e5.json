The rest energy of a particle is given by:\n\nE_rest = mc^2\n\nSo, the total energy of the particle is:\n\nE = 2E_rest = 2(mc^2) = 2m c^2\n\nNow, we can plug this into the relativistic momentum formula:\n\np = sqrt(m^2c^2 + p^2)\n\nSince we are given that the total energy is equal to twice the rest energy, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\np = sqrt(m^2c^2 + 2m c^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\np = sqrt(3m^2c^2)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in terms of the speed of light (c):\n\np = sqrt(3m^2c^2)\n\np = sqrt(3m^2 * c^2)\n\np = sqrt(3) * m * c\n\nNow, we can compare this result to the options given:\n\nA. mc/2\nB. mc/(2^(1/2))\nC. mc\nD. (3^(1/2))mc\n\nThe correct answer is D. (3^(1/2))mc.",
