(P \u2261 D) \u2261 G: This represents \"P is equivalent to D is equivalent to G\". This doesn't match the given sentence.\n\nB. (D \u2022 G) \u2283 P: This represents \"If D and G, then P\". This doesn't match the given sentence either.\n\nC. P \u2283 (D \u2022 G): This represents \"P implies (D and G)\". This doesn't match the given sentence either.\n\nD. P \u2261 (D \u2022 G): This represents \"P is equivalent to (D and G)\". This matches the given sentence.\n\nSo, the best symbolization of the given sentence in propositional logic is option D.",
