The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nWhen consumer confidence increases, it leads to an increase in the demand for goods and services in the economy. This increase in demand, along with the assumption of an upward sloping aggregate supply curve, will cause the equilibrium price level to increase.\n\nAt the same time, as the price level increases, the real income of consumers also increases. This increase in real income will lead to an increase in the quantity of output demanded by consumers, as they are now able to afford more goods and services.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output will both increase.",
