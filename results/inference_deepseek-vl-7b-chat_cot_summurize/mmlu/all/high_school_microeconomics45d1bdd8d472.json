The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nNancy has chosen to study for the exam, which means she is receiving a benefit from studying. The opportunity cost of studying is the wage she could have earned by mowing the lawn or babysitting her niece. Since Nancy is choosing to study, the benefit she receives from studying must be greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The opportunity cost of studying is $14, which is less than the benefit received from studying.\nC. Nancy is indifferent to both studying and mowing the lawn.\nD. Nancy's behavior is irrational, since babysitting was clearly superior to all other options.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the opportunity cost of studying is not $14. It is the wage she could have earned by mowing the lawn or babysitting her niece, which is $8.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that Nancy is indifferent between studying and mowing the lawn. However, we know that Nancy has chosen to study, so she must have found the benefit of studying greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that Nancy's choice to study is irrational. However, we know that Nancy has chosen to study, so her choice must be based on her own preferences and values.",
