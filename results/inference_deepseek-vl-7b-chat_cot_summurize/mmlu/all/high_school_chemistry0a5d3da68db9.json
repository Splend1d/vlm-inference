In the given equations, the reaction products and reactants are in the same state. Therefore, all the equations are homogeneous reactions. However, if we have to choose one that is most likely to be a heterogeneous reaction, it would be:\n\nC(s) + H2O(g) \u2192 H2(g) + CO(g)\n\nThis reaction involves a solid reactant (C) and gaseous products (H2 and CO), which suggests that it could be a heterogeneous reaction if it occurs in a solid-gas phase change. However, this is not a typical heterogeneous reaction, as most heterogeneous reactions involve a solid reactant and a gaseous product.",
