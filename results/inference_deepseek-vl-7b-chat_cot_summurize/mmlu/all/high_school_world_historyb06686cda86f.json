            "content": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nMoreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations?\n\nA. Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\nB. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\nC. Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\nD. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\n",

            "content": "The passage provided by W.H. Moreland discusses the dynamics of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire, particularly in Northern India. It mentions that a zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was in a position of dependence, and that there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying an \"anomalous position\" in relation to the empire. These chiefs and tribes sometimes paid the stipulated revenue, sometimes rebelled, and sometimes enjoyed practical independence due to the Mogul authorities' lack of active measures of coercion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not specify that only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not state that revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not claim that the case of Rajputana was typical in the Mughal Empire. It only mentions that there were numerous chiefs and tribes in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur who occupied an anomalous position.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, is supported by the passage. The passage mentions that geographical differences may have influenced which groups paid taxes, as some chiefs and tribes in Northern India were in a position of dependence due to their location, while others enjoyed practical independence due to the Mogul authorities' lack of active measures of coercion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire, as it illustrates the geographical differences that may have influenced which groups paid taxes.",
