            "content": "A. Crystal oscillator.\n\nCrystal oscillators are easy to fabricate in a monolithic IC because they use a single crystal of quartz, which is a very stable material. The crystal's vibrations are used to generate a stable clock signal, and the oscillator can be integrated into a single chip.\n\nB. Hartley oscillator.\n\nThe Hartley oscillator is not typically easy to fabricate in a monolithic IC because it requires two separate crystal oscillators to generate the necessary frequency difference. This makes it more complex to integrate into a single chip.\n\nC. Wien bridge oscillator.\n\nThe Wien bridge oscillator is also not typically easy to fabricate in a monolithic IC because it requires a complex network of resistors and capacitors to generate the necessary frequency. This makes it more complex to integrate into a single chip.\n\nD. Relaxation oscillator.\n\nThe relaxation oscillator is not typically easy to fabricate in a monolithic IC because it requires a complex network of transistors and resistors to generate the necessary frequency. This makes it more complex to integrate into a single chip.",
