Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be\n\nA. admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.\nB. admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.\nC. excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.\nD. excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.\n",

            "content": "The injured driver's attorney objects to the city attorney's evidence because it is considered \"negative evidence.\" Negative evidence is any evidence that is used to show that an event did not happen or that a person did not commit a certain act. In this case, the city attorney is trying to use the fact that no accidents have occurred at the intersection for 14 years to show that the intersection is not dangerous or heavily traveled.\n\nHowever, the injured driver's attorney argues that this evidence is improper because it is attempting to prove a negative (that no accidents have occurred) rather than a positive (that the intersection is safe). The attorney believes that this evidence could confuse the jury and lead them to believe that the intersection is not dangerous, even though the injured driver's case is based on the lack of warning signs and the fact that the intersection is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the injured driver's attorney's objection is valid, and the city attorney's evidence should be excluded from the trial. The correct answer is C. Excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.",
