Since we are given the frequencies of the two alleles, we can calculate the frequency of the heterozygous condition (Bb) by subtracting the frequencies of the homozygous dominant (BB) and homozygous recessive (bb) alleles from the total allele frequency (100%).\n\nThe frequency of the heterozygous condition (Bb) is:\n\n100% - (0.04 * 2) - (0.96 * 2) = 100% - 0.08 - 1.92 = 91.04%\n\nSo, the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 91.04%.
