            "content": "To determine the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny, we need to analyze the genotypes of the parents and understand the inheritance of the traits.\n\nThe tall plant (D) is completely dominant to the dwarf plant (d), so the genotype of the tall plant will always be DDWw (where D is dominant, D is the tall plant allele, and w is the white flower color allele).\n\nThe violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the white flower color (w), so the genotype of the tall plant will always be DDWw (where W is dominant, W is the violet flower color allele, and w is the white flower color allele).\n\nNow, let's analyze the cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant (ddww).\n\nThe offspring will have the genotype of the tall plant (DDWw) because the tall plant is completely dominant to the dwarf plant. The offspring will have the genotype of the dwarf plant (ddww) because the dwarf plant is completely recessive to the tall plant.\n\nSince the tall plant is completely dominant to the dwarf plant, the offspring will be tall (D) regardless of the presence of the dwarf plant allele (d). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio of the progeny will be:\n\n1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.",
