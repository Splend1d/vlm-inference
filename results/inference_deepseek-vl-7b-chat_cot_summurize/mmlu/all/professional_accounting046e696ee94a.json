            "content": "A. Deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records.\n\nThis option is incorrect because deviations from pertinent controls can affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records. If a control is not functioning properly, it can increase the risk of material misstatement.\n\nB. Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.\n\nThis option is also incorrect because it suggests that deviations from pertinent controls can result in misstatements at a lower rate. However, this is not always the case. The rate of deviations and the resulting misstatements can depend on various factors, such as the nature of the control and the circumstances under which it is being tested.\n\nC. When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk.\n\nThis option is correct because it states that the auditor should consider the degree of assurance desired in a sample when assessing the tolerable rate of deviations. If the auditor wants a high degree of assurance, they should allow for a high level of sampling risk, which may result in a higher tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nD. Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nThis option is incorrect because it suggests that increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls always increases the tolerable rate of deviations. However, this is not always the case. The tolerable rate of deviations depends on various factors, such as the nature of the control and the circumstances under which it is being tested.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk.",
