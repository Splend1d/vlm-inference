In this case, the value of a positional good increases as it moves up the hierarchy of goods. \n\nIn Peter Singer's definition, positional goods are those that are valued more highly when they are higher in a hierarchy of goods. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Being at least six feet tall (in a population where this is above average) - This is a positional good because its value increases as it moves up the hierarchy of height.\n\nB. Having an IQ of at least 150 (in a population where this is the average) - This is not a positional good because its value does not increase as it moves up the hierarchy of intelligence.\n\nC. Being at least six feet tall (in a population where this is the average) - This is not a positional good because its value does not increase as it moves up the hierarchy of height.\n\nD. All of the above - This is not correct because option B is not a positional good.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Being at least six feet tall (in a population where this is above average) is a positional good according to Peter Singer's definition.",
