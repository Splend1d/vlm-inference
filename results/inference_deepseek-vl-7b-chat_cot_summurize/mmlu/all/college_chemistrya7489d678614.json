Al(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq)\nIn this reaction, Al is reduced from +3 to +1, and Na is reduced from +1 to 0. The overall reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy.\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)\nIn this reaction, Zn is reduced from +2 to +1, and Ag is reduced from +1 to 0. The overall reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy.\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\nIn this reaction, Pb is reduced from +4 to +2, and Ca is reduced from +5 to +2. The overall reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy.\n\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\nIn this reaction, Pb is reduced from +4 to +2, and Li is reduced from +1 to 0. The overall reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy.\n\nBased on the oxidation-reduction potential and the exothermic nature of the reactions, all four options are possible. However, option D is the most likely to occur because it involves the most significant reduction in oxidation state (from +4 to +2 for Pb), and the reaction is exothermic.",
