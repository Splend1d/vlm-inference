We can use the formula:\n\na = (v_f - v_i) / t\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, v_f is the final speed, v_i is the initial speed, and t is the time.\n\nv_f = 20.0 m/s\nv_i = 0 m/s (since the car starts from rest)\nt = 15.0 s\n\na = (20.0 - 0) / 15.0\na = 20.0 / 15.0\na = 4/3 m/s\u00b2 (approximately)\n\nNow, we can find the initial speed of the car:\n\nv_i = a \u00d7 t\nv_i = (4/3) \u00d7 (15.0)\nv_i \u2248 20.0 m/s\n\nNow we can find the distance the car travels:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance = 20.0 m/s \u00d7 15.0 s\nDistance \u2248 300 m\n\nSo, the car travels approximately 300 meters during this time.
