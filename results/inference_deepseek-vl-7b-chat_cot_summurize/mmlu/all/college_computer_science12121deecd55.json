This is because a complete graph with an even number of vertices (12 in this case) will always have an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit is a closed walk that visits every edge exactly once. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so every edge is used exactly once in an Eulerian circuit.\n\nOption II (a complete graph with 13 vertices) will not have an Euler circuit. This is because a complete graph with an odd number of vertices (13 in this case) will not have an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit is only possible for graphs with an even number of vertices.\n\nOption III (a tree with 13 vertices) will not have an Euler circuit. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and therefore, it does not have an Euler circuit. An Euler circuit requires at least one cycle, which is not present in a tree.",
