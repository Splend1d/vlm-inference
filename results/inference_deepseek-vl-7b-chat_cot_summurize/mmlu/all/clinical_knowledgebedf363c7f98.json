            "content": "A. Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered\n\nDiplopia, also known as double vision, is a condition where a person sees two images of a single object instead of the usual single image. This occurs when there is a problem with the way the eyes work together as a team. If one eye is covered, the other eye can still function normally, so the person would not experience double vision.\n\nB. The outer image is always the false image\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. In diplopia, the outer image is not always the false image. The outer image is the one that is seen when the eyes are not working together properly, while the inner image is the true image that is seen when the eyes are working together correctly. The relative positions of the outer and inner images can vary depending on the type of diplopia.\n\nC. A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards\n\nThis statement is not true. A fourth nerve palsy is a condition where there is damage to the fourth cranial nerve, which controls the muscles that control the movements of the eyes. This can cause double vision, but the direction in which the double vision occurs is not necessarily related to the direction in which the patient is looking.\n\nD. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\n\nThis statement is not true. A sixth nerve palsy is a condition where there is damage to the sixth cranial nerve, which controls the muscles that control the movements of the eyes. This can cause double vision, but the direction in which the double vision occurs is not necessarily related to the direction in which the patient is looking. A sixth nerve palsy can cause double vision in one eye, but it does not necessarily cause a divergent squint.",
