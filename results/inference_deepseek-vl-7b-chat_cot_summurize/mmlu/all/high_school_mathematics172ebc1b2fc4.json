A ten-year loan with an annual interest rate of $10\\%$ compounded quarterly, with the condition that at the end of 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes. The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of the ten years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance. 2. A ten-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of $12\\%$, with just one lump-sum payment at the end of the ten years. Find the positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes. Round your answer to the nearest dollar.\n\nA. 16401\nB. 16400\nC. 382\nD. 383\n",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Alex has to pay back under both schemes.\n\nFor the first scheme, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial amount), r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, P = $10,000, r = 0.10, n = 4 (compounded quarterly), and t = 5 + 5 = 10 years.\n\nA = $10,000(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*10)\nA = $10,000(1.01)^(40)\nA = $10,000 * 1.05104\nA = $10,510.40\n\nAt the end of 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes, so he pays $10,510.40 / 2 = $5,255.20.\n\nAt the end of 10 years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance, which is $10,510.40 - $5,255.20 = $5,255.20.\n\nSo, under the first scheme, Alex has to pay back a total of $5,255.20 + $5,255.20 = $10,510.40.\n\nFor the second scheme, Alex has to make a single lump-sum payment at the end of 10 years.\n\nThe simple interest formula is:\n\nI = P * r * t\n\nwhere I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, P = $10,000, r = 0.12, and t = 10 years.\n\nI = $10,000 * 0.12 * 10\nI = $1,200\n\nSo, under the second scheme, Alex has to pay back a total of $10,000 + $1,200 = $11,200.\n\nThe positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes is $11,200 - $10,510.40 = $689.60.\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
