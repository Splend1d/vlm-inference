            "content": "An octagon has 8 sides, so it also has 8 interior angles. To find the measure of each interior angle, we can divide the sum of the interior angles by the number of angles. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees. In this case, $n=8$, so the sum of the interior angles is $180(8-2)=180(6)=1080$ degrees. Dividing by 8, we find that each interior angle of the octagon measures $\\frac{1080}{8}=135$ degrees.\n\nTherefore, the measure of an interior angle of the sign is $\\boxed{B}$.\nThe answer is: 135",
