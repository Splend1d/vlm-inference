            "content": "The key difference between US expansion pre- and post-1865 was that before 1865, US expansion was primarily based on territorial acquisitions, such as the annexation of new lands and territories, while after 1865, US expansion was more focused on market-based strategies, such as the expansion of trade and economic influence in Latin America and other regions.\n\nBefore 1865, the US had already expanded significantly, acquiring new territories such as California and the Southwest from Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, and the Oregon Territory from Great Britain in the Treaty of Oregon in 1846. These acquisitions were based on territorial control and the US government's desire to expand its influence and control over new lands.\n\nAfter 1865, however, the US shifted its focus towards market-based expansion, particularly in Latin America. The US sought to expand its economic influence and access to new markets, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. This shift in focus was driven by the desire to increase US exports and investment, as well as to counterbalance the growing influence of European powers in the region.\n\nOverall, the key difference between US expansion pre- and post-1865 was the shift from a focus on territorial acquisitions to a focus on market-based expansion and economic influence.",
