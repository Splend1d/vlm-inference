No, because the government has a right to have its designated representative remain in the courtroom through-out the trial.\nC. Yes, because the agent\u00d5s testimony might be influenced by the testimony of other witnesses.\nD.

No, provided that the government can show that the agent's presence is essential to the presentation of its case.\n\nThe defendant's motion to exclude the FBI agent from the courtroom should not be granted. The government has the right to designate a representative to present its case, and in this case, the agent has been designated as the representative. The defendant's motion to exclude the agent is based on the potential influence of other witnesses' testimony on the agent's testimony. However, the defendant cannot exclude the agent based on this potential influence, as the agent's presence is not inherently prejudicial to the defendant.\n\nThe defendant's motion should be denied, provided that the government can show that the agent's presence is essential to the presentation of its case.
