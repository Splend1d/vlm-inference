How is the amount of money Leslie spent written as a fraction?\n\nThe amount of money Leslie spent can be written as a fraction as 20 + 8/100. To simplify this, we can convert 8/100 to a fraction with a denominator of 100, which is 8/1. So, the amount of money Leslie spent is 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = 20 + 8/1 = ",
