This concept is central to Rawls's A Theory of Justice, where he argues that the principles of justice should be chosen by those who are least advantaged in society, in a hypothetical \"original position\" where they have no advantage over others. This is to ensure that the principles of justice are chosen not for the benefit of any particular group, but for the benefit of society as a whole.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. fair",
