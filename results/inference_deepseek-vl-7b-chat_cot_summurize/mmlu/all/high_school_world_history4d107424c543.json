Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n",

            "content": "The author's assertion is that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment. To support this assertion, we need to find evidence that shows the active involvement of Western European capitalists in exploiting Africa and contributing to its underdevelopment.\n\nOption A talks about the slave trade, which was a system of forced labor, not direct exploitation by Western European capitalists.\n\nOption B discusses the sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants, which is also not directly related to Western European capitalists.\n\nOption D mentions trade links between Europe and Ethiopia, which could potentially be a sign of economic interaction, but it does not provide evidence of exploitation or underdevelopment.\n\nOption C, however, states that the establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company was a direct result of Western European capitalism's expansion. This implies that the Dutch capitalists were actively involved in exploiting Africa and contributing to its underdevelopment.\n\nTherefore, the best answer to support the author's assertion is option C.",
