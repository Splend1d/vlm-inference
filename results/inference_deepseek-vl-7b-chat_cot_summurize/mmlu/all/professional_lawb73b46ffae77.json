Political parties conduct primaries, and the winning candidates in each office may have their names placed on the ballot. However, nominees of political bodies or any independent candidate may only have their names placed on the ballot if they file a nominating petition signed by not less than 7% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the offices that they are seeking. The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, which is also the deadline governing party candidates in party primaries. An independent candidate, who desires to be listed on the ballot for the office of governor, challenges the constitutionality of this election law. The court will most likely declare this statute\n\nA. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech.\nB. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions.\nD. constitutional, because the election code is nonviolative of the equal protection clause.\n",

The independent candidate in this case is challenging the constitutionality of the election law, which is a form of petitioning the government. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process clause also protects the right to petition the government, but the question specifically asks for the court's most likely decision, so the First Amendment is the more relevant answer.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process clause is not directly relevant to the issue of petitioning the government, which is the main focus of the candidate's challenge.\n\nC. The Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions are not directly relevant to the issue of petitioning the government, which is the main focus of the candidate's challenge.\n\nD.
