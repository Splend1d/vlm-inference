So, the disk transfer time for a large file under version 2 is:\n1 msec per 4,000 bytes * 1,000 bytes = 1 msec\n\nThe total time required to read a large file under version 2 is:\n25 msec + 8 msec + 1 msec + 1 msec + 10 msec = 44 msec\n\nThe ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is:\n44 msec / 44 msec = 1:1\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1:1.",
