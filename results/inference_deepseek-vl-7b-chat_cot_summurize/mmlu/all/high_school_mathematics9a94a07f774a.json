            "content": "To find the expected number of times Bob will roll his die, we need to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n\nA non-leap year has 365 days. Bob has 365 chances to roll his die.\n\nLet's consider the different outcomes:\n\n1. Bob rolls a composite number: There are 5 composite numbers (4, 6, 8, 9, 10) out of 365 possible outcomes. So, the probability of Bob rolling a composite number is 5/365.\n\n2. Bob rolls a prime number: There are 5 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11) out of 365 possible outcomes. So, the probability of Bob rolling a prime number is 5/365.\n\n3. Bob rolls a 1: There is 1 outcome (1) out of 365 possible outcomes. So, the probability of Bob rolling a 1 is 1/365.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected number of times Bob will roll his die by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the number of times it occurs and summing them up:\n\nExpected number of rolls = (5/365) * 5 + (5/365) * 5 + (1/365) * 1\nExpected number of rolls = (25/365) + (25/365) + (1/365)\nExpected number of rolls = (41/365)\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 7:\n\nExpected number of rolls = (41/365) * (7/7)\nExpected number of rolls = 287/2555\n\nSo, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die is approximately 287/2555, which is closest to option C.",
