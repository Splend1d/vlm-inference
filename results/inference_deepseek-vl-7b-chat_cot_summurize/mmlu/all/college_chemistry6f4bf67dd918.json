            "content": "A. Blackbody radiation curves\n\nPlanck's quantum theory explained the blackbody radiation curves, which showed that the energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized. This means that light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation come in discrete packets of energy, known as photons. This theory also provided the famous Planck's law, which describes the distribution of energy in blackbody radiation.\n\nB. Emission spectra of diatomic molecules\n\nThe emission spectra of diatomic molecules were also explained by Planck's quantum theory. According to the theory, the energy of a molecule can only be released in discrete amounts corresponding to the energy levels of the electrons in the molecule. When an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits light with a specific wavelength, resulting in the emission spectrum of the molecule.\n\nC. Electron diffraction patterns\n\nWhile Planck's quantum theory did not directly explain electron diffraction patterns, it was later developed into the quantum mechanics theory, which does explain these patterns. According to quantum mechanics, electrons behave as particles and waves simultaneously, and their wave-like nature causes diffraction patterns when they interact with a barrier.\n\nD. Temperature dependence of reaction rates\n\nPlanck's quantum theory does not directly explain the temperature dependence of reaction rates. This phenomenon is generally explained by the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate of a chemical reaction to the activation energy and the concentration of the reactants. The activation energy is related to the temperature, and as the temperature increases, the reaction rate also increases.",
