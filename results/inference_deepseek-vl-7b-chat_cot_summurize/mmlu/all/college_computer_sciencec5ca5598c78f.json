A context-free grammar is a formal language that can be used to describe context-free languages. The language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} can be described using a context-free grammar that has a single production rule: S -> wS | w.\n\nHowever, the language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} is not regular because it does not have the pumping lemma property. The pumping lemma is a property that a language must satisfy in order to be regular. A language is regular if and only if it satisfies the pumping lemma. The language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} does not satisfy the pumping lemma, so it is not regular.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
