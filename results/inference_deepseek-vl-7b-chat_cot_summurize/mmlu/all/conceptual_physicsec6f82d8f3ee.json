But all have the same speed on average.\n\nIn a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases at a given temperature, the average speed of the molecules is the same for all the gases. This is because the temperature determines the average speed of the molecules, and it is independent of the type of gas. Therefore, the molecules of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen will all have the same average speed in the mixture.",
