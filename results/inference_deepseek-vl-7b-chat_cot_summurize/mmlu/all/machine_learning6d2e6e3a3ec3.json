While both the junction tree algorithm and variable elimination can be used to compute the posterior distribution of a random variable given the evidence, they do not always yield the same results. The junction tree algorithm is a recursive algorithm that builds a tree structure, while variable elimination is a more direct method that eliminates variables from the joint distribution. The two methods can produce different results, especially when the structure of the Bayesian network is complex.\n\nStatement 2: If two random variables X and Y are conditionally independent given another random variable Z, then in the corresponding Bayesian network, the nodes for X and Y are d-separated given Z.\n\nThis statement is true. In a Bayesian network, nodes are d-separated if the conditional independence of their respective parents implies that the joint distribution of the nodes is factorized. If X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, it means that the joint distribution of X and Y given Z is a product of their individual conditional distributions, which implies that the nodes for X and Y are d-separated given Z.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.
