While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact percentage of Americans who were in favor of the act, it is known that the majority of the population supported it.\n\nAccording to historical records, the Social Security Act was passed by Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. The act was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, and it was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nIt is likely that the majority of Americans were in favor of the Social Security Act, but it is difficult to provide an exact percentage. However, it is safe to say that the support for the act was widespread and that it was a popular and important piece of legislation at the time.",
