            "content": "Let's denote the probability of rolling an odd number as p and the probability of rolling an even number as q. We are given that q = 2p.\n\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll is p, and the probability of rolling a 6 on the second roll is q. We want to find the probability of both events happening.\n\nThe probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities, so we have:\n\nP(5, 6) = p * q\n\nSince q = 2p, we can substitute q in the equation:\n\nP(5, 6) = p * (2p)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nP(5, 6) = 2p^2\n\nWe are given that the probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number, so we have:\n\nq = 2p\n\nSubstituting q in the equation:\n\n2p^2 = 2p^2\n\nNow, we can solve for p:\n\np^2 = 1\n\np = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of p, we can find the probability of both events happening:\n\nP(5, 6) = 2(1^2) = 2\n\nSo, the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6 is 2/81.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",
