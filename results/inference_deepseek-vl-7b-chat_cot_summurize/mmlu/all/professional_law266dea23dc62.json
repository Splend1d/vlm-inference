            "content": "A federal employees union brought an action in federal court asking for an injunction preventing the U.S. Treasury Department from enforcing mandatory drug testing against its members who carried firearms or interdicted drugs in their official duties. When an employee in one of those categories sought a promotion, the government required him or her to undergo a program of providing urine specimens for analysis. The union claimed that these searches were in violation of the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy and to be free from unreasonable searches. The union lost the case in the lower federal court and in the Court of Appeals, but the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear it. What will the Supreme Court decide?\n\nA. The drug testing policy is unconstitutional because the searches are made without probable cause or suspicion.\nB. The drug testing policy is unconstitutional in that it violates the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy.\nC. It is reasonable to conduct suspicionless testing of employees who are involved in drug interdiction or the handling of firearms.\nD. It is reasonable for a government employer to conduct suspicionless searches under any circumstances.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is B. The drug testing policy is unconstitutional in that it violates the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. In this case, the federal employees union argued that the mandatory drug testing of its members, who were involved in drug interdiction or the handling of firearms, violated their Fourth Amendment rights. The union claimed that the searches were unreasonable because they were conducted without probable cause or suspicion.\n\nThe lower federal court and the Court of Appeals agreed with the union, ruling that the drug testing policy was unconstitutional. However, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, indicating that there may be a split in the lower courts' opinions.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in this case will likely hinge on whether the government can justify the drug testing policy as a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. If the Court decides that the policy is unreasonable, it will uphold the lower court's ruling and find that the drug testing policy is unconstitutional. If the Court decides that the policy is reasonable, it will uphold the lower court's ruling and find that the drug testing policy is constitutional.\n\nIn summary, the Supreme Court will likely decide that the drug testing policy is unconstitutional because it violates the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy.",
