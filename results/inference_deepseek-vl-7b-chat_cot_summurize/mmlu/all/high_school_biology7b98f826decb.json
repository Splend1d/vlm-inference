            "content": "The probability that the child has type O blood is 100%. This is because type O blood is known as the \"universal donor\" in blood transfusions. Type O blood can be transfused to individuals with any blood type because it lacks the antigen (A and B) that causes an immune response. However, type O blood lacks the antibodies that would cause an immune response in the recipient. Therefore, if type O blood is transfused to an individual with a different blood type, the recipient's immune system will not recognize the transfused blood as foreign and will not produce antibodies against it.\n\nIn the case of the two individuals with different blood types (type B and type AB), their child will inherit one gene from each parent. The child will have either type B or type AB blood, as these are the only two blood types that can be passed down by both parents. However, the child will also inherit the gene for type O blood from both parents, regardless of their blood type. Therefore, the child will have type O blood, as the gene for type O blood is dominant over the genes for type B and type AB blood.",
