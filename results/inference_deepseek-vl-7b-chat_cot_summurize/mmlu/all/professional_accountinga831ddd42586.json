No contract was formed because the offer failed to state an expiration date.\n\nExplanation: According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), an offer must contain an expiration date or be deemed to have an implied expiration date of 30 days from its receipt by the offeree. In this case, the offer did not specify an expiration date, so it was deemed to have an implied expiration date of 30 days. Since Sands received the revocation of the offer before the expiration date, a contract was not formed.",
