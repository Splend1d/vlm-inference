In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. All students who attend the Peddie School study Latin.\n2. Some students who study Latin also study calculus.\n3. Jerome is a student at the Peddie School.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that since Jerome is a student at the Peddie School, he must study Latin. This is because all students at the Peddie School study Latin, and Jerome is a student at the Peddie School.\n\nHowever, the premises do not provide any information about whether Jerome studies calculus or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jerome studies calculus (A) or both calculus and Latin (C). We can only conclude that Jerome studies Latin (B).\n\nFinally, the premises do not provide any information about whether Jerome studies either calculus or Latin (D). Since we have already concluded that Jerome studies Latin (B), we can say that Jerome studies either calculus or Latin, but we cannot specify which one.",
