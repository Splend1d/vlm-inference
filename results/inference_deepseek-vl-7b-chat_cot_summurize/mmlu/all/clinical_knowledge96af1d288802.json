            "content": "A hypertonic solution is a medical term referring to a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. This means that the solution has more dissolved substances per volume of fluid compared to the fluids inside and outside of normal human cells. Hypertonic solutions are often used in medical treatments to help rehydrate or to deliver medication to specific areas of the body.\n\nOption B is incorrect because hypertonic solutions do not block off enteral tubes easily. In fact, they are often used to flush out tubes or to deliver medication through them.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because a hypertonic solution is precisely one that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a hypertonic solution does not have a high fiber content. In fact, the term \"hypertonic\" refers to the concentration of solutes, not the presence of any specific type of substance like fiber.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.",
