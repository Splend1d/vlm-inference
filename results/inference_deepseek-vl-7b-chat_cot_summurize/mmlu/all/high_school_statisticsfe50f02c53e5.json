This is because the mean is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values, so if all values are the same, the mean is zero. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean, so if all values are the same, the squared differences are zero, and the variance is zero. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so if the variance is zero, the standard deviation is also zero.\n\nHowever, the range of a data set is the difference between the highest and lowest values. If all values are the same, the highest and lowest values will be the same, so the range will be zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Range.",
