At sentencing the court made additional factual findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. Does counsel have a valid constitutional argument?\n\nA. No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.\n",
