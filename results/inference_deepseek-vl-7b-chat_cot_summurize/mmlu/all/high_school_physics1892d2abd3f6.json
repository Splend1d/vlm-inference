This is because the force is distributed equally between the two people, so the heavier person experiences half the force of the lighter person.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The force felt by the person is -2F. This is not correct because the force is not negative. The force is simply distributed equally between the two people, so the heavier person experiences half the force of the lighter person, not twice the force.\n\nC. The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person. This is not correct because the acceleration is not directly related to the force. The acceleration is determined by the mass of the person and the force applied, not the distribution of the force.\n\nD. The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person. This is not correct because the acceleration is not directly related to the force. The acceleration is determined by the mass of the person and the force applied, not the distribution of the force.",
