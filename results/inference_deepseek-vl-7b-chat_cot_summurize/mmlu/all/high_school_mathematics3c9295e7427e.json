            "content": "Let's denote the number of grams remaining after t days as g(t). We are given that g(0) = 50 and g(9) = 45. We want to find the number of days after the experiment started when g(t) = 20.\n\nWe can use the formula for exponential decay: g(t) = g(0) * e^(-kt), where k is the decay constant and t is the time in days.\n\nFirst, we need to find the decay constant k. We can use the formula: k = ln(g(9)/g(0)) / (9 * 24), where ln is the natural logarithm.\n\nk = ln(45/50) / (9 * 24)\nk \u2248 0.0438 / 216\nk \u2248 0.0020\n\nNow we can find the number of days when g(t) = 20:\n\n20 = 50 * e^(-0.0020t)\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n0.4 = e^(-0.0020t)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(0.4) = -0.0020t\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt \u2248 ln(0.4) / -0.0020\nt \u2248 12.32 / -0.0020\nt \u2248 614.4\n\nSince we are looking for the number of days after the experiment started, we need to round up to the nearest day:\n\nt \u2248 615\n\nSo, there will be only 20 grams remaining approximately 615 days after the experiment started.
