            "content": "To find the rate constant for a first-order reaction, we can use the integrated rate law:\n\nln(2) / t = k\n\nwhere t is the half-life of the reaction.\n\nIn this case, the half-life (t) is 34 minutes. Plugging this value into the equation, we get:\n\nln(2) / 34 = k\n\nNow, we need to find the rate constant (k) in seconds. To do this, we can rewrite the equation in seconds:\n\nln(2) / 34 = k * 60\n\nNow, we can solve for k:\n\nk = ln(2) / (34 * 60)\n\nk \u2248 2.9 \u00d7 10^-1 min^-1\n\nSo, the rate constant for this first-order reaction is approximately 2.9 \u00d7 10^-1 min^-1, which corresponds to option C.",
