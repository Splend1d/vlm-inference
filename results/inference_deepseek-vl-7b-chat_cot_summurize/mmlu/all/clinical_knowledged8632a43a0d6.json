There are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram.\n\n62 kg * 1000 g/kg = 62,000 g\n\nNow, we can find the dose in grams by multiplying the person's weight in grams by the drug dose per kilogram:\n\n62,000 g * 15 mg/kg = 930 mg\n\nFinally, we need to convert the dose from milligrams to grams:\n\n930 mg * 1000 g/mg = 930,000 g\n\nSo, the person's dose is 930,000 grams. The closest answer from the given options is:\n\nA. 930",
