Cows are often fed grass, and it is a common practice in agriculture. There is no indication that the action is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is giving a sick child two Advil for her fever. This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Advil is a common over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer, and it is generally considered safe for children with a fever. Giving a child medication to alleviate their symptoms is not morally wrong.",
