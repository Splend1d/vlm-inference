Since the student had the same standardized score (z-score) on the final exam, we can use the z-score for the midterm score.\n\nz = 1.5\n\nTherefore, the student's score on the final exam must have been 1.5 standard deviations above the mean of the final exam scores.\n\nz = 1.5 * 10\nz = 15\n\nThe student's score on the final exam must have been 15 points above the mean of the final exam scores.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 15 points.",
