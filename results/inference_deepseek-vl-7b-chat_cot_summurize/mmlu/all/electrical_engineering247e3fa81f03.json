            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the Lambert-Beer's law, which states that the intensity of light (candle power) is directly proportional to the square of the distance from the light source. In this case, the illumination at a point 5 meters below the lamp is 6 lux.\n\nLet's denote the candle power of the lamp as C. According to Lambert-Beer's law, we have:\n\nIllumination = (Candle power)\u00b2 / Distance\u00b2\n\n6 = C\u00b2 / 5\u00b2\n\nNow, we can solve for C:\n\nC\u00b2 = 6 * 5\u00b2\nC\u00b2 = 6 * 25\nC\u00b2 = 150\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nC = \u221a150\nC \u2248 12.24\n\nSo, the candle power of the lamp is approximately 12.24. However, the options provided are not in the same order of magnitude. The closest option to 12.24 is 150, which is option C. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 150",
