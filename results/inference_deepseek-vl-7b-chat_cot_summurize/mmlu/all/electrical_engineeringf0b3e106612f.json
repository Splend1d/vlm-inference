The correct answer should be in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, we can use the formula:\n\nRadians = (Degrees * \u03c0) / 180\n\nSo, the solid angle in radians is:\n\nSolid angle \u2248 (200 * \u03c0) / 180\n\nSolid angle \u2248 1.1579\n\nSince the options are not in radians, we cannot directly compare the answer to the options given. However, if we convert the answer to radians, it would be approximately 1.1579 radians.",
