Divide the total number of apples by the number of apples used for each pie.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of apples\nThe bakers have 15 boxes of apples, and each box has 18 apples. So, the total number of apples is:\n15 boxes * 18 apples/box = 270 apples\n\nStep 2: Divide the total number of apples by the number of apples used for each pie\nThe bakers use 7 apples for each pie. So, the total number of apple pies they can make is:\n270 apples / 7 apples/pie = 38 pies\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 38 apple pies.",
