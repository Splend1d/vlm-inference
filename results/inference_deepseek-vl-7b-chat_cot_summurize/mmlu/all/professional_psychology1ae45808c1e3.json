While both MRI and CT are used to diagnose skull fractures, CT is more sensitive in detecting fractures due to its ability to provide cross-sectional images of the skull, which can reveal the presence of fractures that may not be visible on MRI. MRI is better suited for detecting soft tissue injuries and abnormalities, while CT is more effective in identifying bony injuries and fractures.",
