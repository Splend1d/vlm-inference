Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?\n\nA. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\nB. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.\nC. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.\nD. They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.\n",

            "content": "The passage you provided from Edward Gibbon's \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" discusses the decline of Rome and the factors that contributed to it. However, it does not specifically mention any of the traits you listed (cultural assimilation of conquered peoples, state support of foreign religions, widespread public works projects, or merit-based government bureaucracies).\n\nInstead, the passage focuses on the internal factors that led to Rome's decline, such as the immoderate greatness that led to prosperity, the corrupting influence of the military, and the influx of Barbarians. These factors suggest that the classical empires, including Rome, may have shared a tendency to become overburdened by their own success and to struggle with maintaining their power and control.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the most accurate answer to your question would be:\n\nD. They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.\n\nThis is because the passage suggests that Rome's emperors were forced to resort to corrupt means to maintain their power, such as corrupting the discipline of their military and relaxing the rigor of their military forces. This implies that the Roman government was not based on merit, but rather on personal connections and corruption.",
