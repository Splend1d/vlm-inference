Let's denote the propositions as follows:\n\nC: \"It is raining\"\nD: \"It is not raining\"\n\nThe truth table for the given propositions is as follows:\n\n| C | D | C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) | C \u00b7 ~D |\n|---|---|--------------|--------|\n| T | F | T            | T      |\n| F | F | T            | T      |\n| T | T | T            | T      |\n| F | T | T            | T      |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth values:\n\n1. C \u2283 (D \u2228 C): This statement is true when C is true and D is false, or when C is false and D is true. In our table, this is true in the first and third rows.\n\n2. C \u00b7 ~D: This statement is true when C is true and D is false, or when C is false and D is true. In our table, this is true in the first and third rows.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the statements are logically equivalent, contradictory, or consistent:\n\nA. Logically equivalent: The two statements are logically equivalent because they have the same truth conditions. If C is true, both statements are true. If C is false, both statements are false.\n\nB. Contradictory: The two statements are not contradictory because they have the same truth conditions. If C is true, both statements are true. If C is false, both statements are false.\n\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent: The two statements are consistent because they can both be true at the same time. If C is true, both statements are true. If C is false, both statements are false.\n\nD. Inconsistent: The two statements are not inconsistent because they can both be true at the same time. If C is true, both statements are true. If C is false, both statements are false.\n\nIn conclusion, the statements C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D are logically equivalent, not contradictory, and consistent.",
