When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\" The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\nB. The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.\nC. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\nD. Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n",

            "content": "The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for a landlord to refuse to rent to a prospective tenant because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In this case, the woman's advertisement specifically states that she prefers a white male tenant. This preference is based on her own personal preferences and not on any of the protected characteristics listed in the Fair Housing Act. Therefore, the woman's preference does not violate the Fair Housing Act.\n\nHowever, the advertisement itself could potentially be seen as discriminatory, as it explicitly states that the woman prefers a white male tenant. This could be seen as a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex. However, it is important to note that the woman's preference is not based on sex, but rather on race. Therefore, this would not be a violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nIn conclusion, the woman's preference is not a violation of the Fair Housing Act, but the advertisement itself could potentially be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the correct answer is C. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.",
