            "content": "This question refers to the following information.\nAbout the year 1645, while I lived in London \u2026 I had the opportunity of being acquainted with diverse worthy persons, inquisitive into natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning; and particularly of what has been called the \"New Philosophy\" or \"Experimental Philosophy.\" We did by agreements \u2026 meet weekly in London on a certain day, to treat and discourse of such affairs. \u2026 Our business was (precluding matters of theology and state affairs), to discourse and consider of Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related thereunto: as physic, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments; with the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad. We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nThe passage may be used as evidence for the development of\n\nA. an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nB. the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century\nC. new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nD. the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century\n",

            "content": "The passage describes a group of individuals who met weekly in London to discuss and consider various aspects of natural philosophy, including physics, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments. They also discussed the circulation of the blood, the nature of comets and new stars, the spots on the sun, the phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and the weight of air. They barred all discourses of divinity, state affairs, and news other than what concerned their business of Philosophy.\n\nThis passage provides evidence for the development of an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century. The society met regularly, without any interference from the royal courts or the Church, and focused solely on the study of natural philosophy. They also moved their meetings to different locations, such as the Bull Head in Cheapside and Gresham College, which indicates that they were an organized and active group.\n\nTherefore, the passage does not provide evidence for the development of the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century, new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century, or the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century.",
