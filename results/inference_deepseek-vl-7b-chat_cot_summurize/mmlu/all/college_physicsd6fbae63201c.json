            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the fringe shift in a Michelson interferometer:\n\n\u0394z = (\u03bb/2) * (1/n)\n\nwhere \u0394z is the fringe shift, \u03bb is the wavelength of the light, and n is the index of refraction of the medium.\n\nFirst, we need to find the fringe shift when the gas cell is evacuated. We know that the optical path length is 10 cm and the wavelength of the light is 632.2 nm.\n\n\u0394z = (632.2 nm / 2) * (1/n) = 316.1 nm * (1/n)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of fringes counted when the gas cell is evacuated. We are given that 100 fringes are counted.\n\n\u0394z = 316.1 nm * (1/n) * 100 = 316.1 nm * (1/n) * 10^4 = 3161 nm * (1/n)\n\nNow, we can solve for the index of refraction of the original gas:\n\nn = 3161 nm / 316.1 nm = 10\n\nSo, the index of refraction of the original gas is 1.00063.
