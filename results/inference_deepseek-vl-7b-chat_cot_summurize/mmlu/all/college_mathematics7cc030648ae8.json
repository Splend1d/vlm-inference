            "content": "The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a is the element, e is the identity element of the group, and ^ denotes the group operation.\n\nFor the group of permutations of 5 objects, the identity element is the permutation that leaves all objects in their original positions. The group operation is composition of permutations, so the identity permutation is (1)(2)(3)(4)(5).\n\nLet's find the order of each element in the group of permutations of 5 objects:\n\n1. The identity permutation (1)(2)(3)(4)(5) has order 5, as it leaves all objects in their original positions.\n2. The permutation (2)(3)(4)(5) has order 4, as it swaps positions 2 and 3, then positions 3 and 4, then positions 4 and 5, and finally positions 5 and 1.\n3. The permutation (3)(4)(5) has order 3, as it swaps positions 3 and 4, then positions 4 and 5, and finally positions 5 and 1.\n4. The permutation (4)(5) has order 2, as it swaps positions 4 and 5.\n5. The permutation (5) has order 1, as it leaves all objects in their original positions.\n\nThe largest order of an element in the group of permutations of 5 objects is 5, which is the order of the identity permutation. Therefore, the answer is A.",
