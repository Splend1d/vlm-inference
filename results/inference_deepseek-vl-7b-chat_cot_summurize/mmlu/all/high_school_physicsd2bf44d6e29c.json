            "content": "Since air resistance is negligible, the stone's horizontal speed remains constant at 30 m/s. The stone will enter the water with the same horizontal speed, so the total speed will be the initial horizontal speed plus the vertical speed due to gravity.\n\nThe vertical speed can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv_y = -g * t\n\nwhere v_y is the vertical speed, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2), and t is the time.\n\nv_y = -9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 4 s = -39.24 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the total speed:\n\nTotal speed = Initial horizontal speed + Vertical speed\nTotal speed = 30 m/s + (-39.24 m/s) = 30 m/s - 39.24 m/s = -9.24 m/s\n\nHowever, the total speed cannot be negative. This means that the stone has entered the water with a speed of 0 m/s (since it is at rest when it enters the water). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 30 m/s",
