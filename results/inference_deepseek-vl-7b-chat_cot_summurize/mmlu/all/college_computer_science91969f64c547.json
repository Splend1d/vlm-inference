            "content": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. post(u) < post(v)\nThis statement is not necessarily true. In a depth-first search tree, the postorder traversal visits the vertices in reverse order of the preorder traversal. However, the number of nodes visited in the postorder traversal can be greater than or equal to the number of nodes visited in the preorder traversal. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nII. u is an ancestor of v in T.\nThis statement is true. By definition, the lowest common ancestor of two vertices u and v is a vertex that is an ancestor of both u and v. Since u and v are not in T, they are not ancestors of each other. Therefore, the lowest common ancestor of u and v must be a vertex that is an ancestor of both u and v.\n\nIII. If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The lowest common ancestor of two vertices u and v can be a vertex that is not an ancestor of either u or v. Therefore, the lowest common ancestor of u and v can be a vertex that is not equal to u.\n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
