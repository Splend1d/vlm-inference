            "content": "Let's denote the horizontal length of the screen as L, the vertical length as H, and the diagonal as D.\n\nWe are given that the ratio of the length to the height is 5 to 3, so we can write this as:\n\nL/H = 5/3\n\nWe are also given that the diagonal is 48 inches. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the diagonal to the lengths of the screen:\n\nD^2 = L^2 + H^2\n\nWe can substitute the given diagonal value into the equation:\n\n48^2 = L^2 + H^2\n\nNow, we can solve for L^2:\n\nL^2 = 48^2 - H^2\n\nWe are asked to find how much shorter the horizontal length will be if the measure is made along the diagonal of the television screen rather than along the horizontal length. This means we need to find the difference between the diagonal and the horizontal length:\n\nDifference = L - D\n\nSubstitute the values we have:\n\nDifference = L - 48\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for L^2 from the previous step:\n\nDifference = L^2 - 48^2\n\nWe know that L/H = 5/3, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nDifference = (5/3)H^2 - 48^2\n\nNow, we can solve for the difference:\n\nDifference = (5/3)H^2 - 48^2\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 48^2)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 12^2)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 144)\n\nDifference = (5/3)(H^2 - 14",
