            "content": "A landlord leased an apartment to a tenant on a month-to-month basis beginning on the first of the month, with rent payable monthly. Five months into the lease, the tenant failed to pay rent. The landlord then sued the tenant for possession for nonpayment of rent. The tenant successfully defended this suit on the ground that the apartment was uninhabitable and that, accordingly, no rent was properly payable. On May 7, immediately following the court order in the tenant's favor, the landlord served the tenant with a written but not notarized notice to terminate the tenancy and to vacate the apartment on or before June 30. On July 1, the tenant was still in possession, nothing had changed, and the landlord brought an appropriate action for possession. The tenant prevailed. What is the most likely reason for the court's decision?\n\nA. A six-month notice was required to terminate this periodic tenancy.\nB. The landlord did not give the tenant a notarized notice of termination.\nC. The landlord was attempting to terminate the tenancy as a reaction to the tenant's defense in the previous lawsuit.\nD. The landlord's notice to terminate was improper, because it was given to the tenant more than one month before the required termination date.\n",
