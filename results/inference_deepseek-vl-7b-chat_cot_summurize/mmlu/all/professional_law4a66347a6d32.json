This means that they each own an undivided share of the property, and if one of them dies, their share passes to their heirs.\n\nHowever, the professor then executed a \"correction deed\" that conveyed the apartment building to his son and daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship. This means that they both own the entire property together, and if one of them dies, their share passes to the surviving owner.\n\nThe professor also reserved a life estate in himself, which means that he can continue to live in the apartment building for the rest of his life.\n\nSince the son died intestate (without a will), his share of the property passed to his wife, the doctor. Therefore, the daughter and the doctor now own the apartment building as joint tenants with right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate. This means that they both own the property together, and if one of them dies, their share passes to the surviving owner. However, the professor can continue to live in the apartment building for the rest of his life.",
