On average, the tidal cycle (the time it takes for the Moon to go through its phases) is about 12.5 hours. However, the actual time between high tides can be shorter or longer depending on the specific tidal patterns of the location.\n\nIn some places, the tidal cycle is shorter, and high tides occur more frequently. In other places, the tidal cycle is longer, and high tides occur less frequently. Additionally, the time between high tides can be affected by factors such as the Moon's position, the Earth's position, and the local geography.\n\nSo, while the average time between high tides is 12.5 hours, the actual time can vary depending on the location and other factors.",
