In this case, the compound is 51.9% carbon, 4.86% hydrogen, and 43.2% bromine.\n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest whole number ratio of carbon to hydrogen to bromine.\n\nCarbon:Hydrogen:Bromine = 51.9:4.86:43.2\n\nTo find the smallest whole number ratio, we can divide each percentage by the smallest percentage (4.86) and multiply by 100.\n\nCarbon:Hydrogen:Bromine = (51.9/4.86) * 100 = 107.9\n\nNow, we can find the smallest whole number ratio of carbon to hydrogen to bromine.\n\nCarbon:Hydrogen:Bromine = 107:107:107\n\nSince the ratio of carbon to hydrogen is 107:107, the empirical formula of the compound is C107H107.\n\nHowever, this does not match any of the given options. The closest option is C8H9Br, but this is not the correct empirical formula. The correct empirical formula is C107H107.",
