            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of capacitors in series. When capacitors are connected in series, the voltage across each capacitor is the sum of the individual voltages.\n\nLet V_0 be the initial voltage on the first capacitor. When the first capacitor is disconnected from the battery, it will discharge according to the formula:\n\nV = V_0 * e^(-t/R)\n\nwhere V is the final voltage, V_0 is the initial voltage, t is the time, and R is the resistance of the capacitor.\n\nNow, the other two capacitors are connected in series across the first capacitor. The total voltage across the two capacitors is the sum of their individual voltages:\n\nV_total = V_1 + V_2\n\nwhere V_1 is the voltage on the first capacitor and V_2 is the voltage on the second capacitor.\n\nSince the capacitors are identical and initially uncharged, V_1 = V_2 = 0 V.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the final voltage of the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_0 * e^(-t/R)\n\nSince V_1(t) = V_total - V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_1(t) = V_0 * e^(-t/R)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_total - V_2(t) = V_total - 0 = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_0 * e^(-t/R)\n\nV_1(t) = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t) = V_total\n\nSince V_total = V_1(t) + V_2(t), we can substitute V_2(t) = 0 V:\n\nV_total = V_1(t) + 0 = V_1(t)\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor:\n\nV_1(t",
