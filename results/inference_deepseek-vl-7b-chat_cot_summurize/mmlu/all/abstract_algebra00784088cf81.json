If a is an element of G and H is a subgroup of G, then the set aH is also a subgroup of G. The order of aH is the same as the order of Ha, which is the number of elements in the set aH.\n\nStatement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.\nThis statement is false. The sets aH and Hb are not necessarily identical or disjoint. They are disjoint if and only if a and b are not in the same left coset of H in G. However, this is not guaranteed if a and b belong to G.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
