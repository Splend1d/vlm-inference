            "content": "The speed of a sound wave in air is determined by the product of its frequency and the speed of sound in air, denoted as v. The speed of sound in air is approximately 343 meters per second (m/s) at room temperature.\n\nThe formula for the speed of a sound wave is:\n\nv = f * v_sound\n\nwhere v is the speed of the sound wave, f is the frequency of the sound wave, and v_sound is the speed of sound in air.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the sound wave is 4f, we can substitute this into the formula:\n\nv = 4f * v_sound\n\nNow, we can solve for the speed of the sound wave with frequency 4f:\n\nv_4f = 4 * v_sound\n\nv_4f = 4 * 343 m/s\n\nv_4f = 1372 m/s\n\nSo, a sound wave with frequency 4f will travel through the air at a speed of 1372 m/s.\n\nComparing this speed to the options given:\n\nA. v/4 = 1372 m/s / 343 m/s = 4 m/s\nB. v = 343 m/s\nC. 2v = 2 * 343 m/s = 686 m/s\nD. 4v = 4 * 343 m/s = 1372 m/s\n\nThe correct answer is D. 4v, which is the speed of the sound wave with frequency 4f.",
