Tax the citizens of the community.\n\nThe best example of a negative externality in this case is the air pollution from the factory. This is a negative externality because the factory's pollution is causing harm to the community members (the children) who did not create the pollution themselves.\n\nThe appropriate plan for eliminating this negative externality would be to tax the factory for its pollution. This would encourage the factory to reduce its pollution, as the cost of pollution would be passed on to the factory in the form of a tax. This would also provide an incentive for the factory to find ways to reduce its pollution, such as by investing in cleaner technologies or by finding ways to reduce its emissions.",
