            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which is used to determine the expected frequencies of alleles in a population. The equation is:\n\nP(A) = (p^2) + (2pq) + (q^2)\n\nwhere P(A) is the frequency of the dominant allele, p is the frequency of the dominant allele in heterozygous individuals, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, and pq is the frequency of the heterozygous individuals.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the incidence of X-linked recessive disorder in males is 1 in 100. This means that the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1/100. We are not given the frequency of the recessive allele (q), so we cannot directly calculate the expected frequency of affected homozygous females.\n\nHowever, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to find the expected frequency of affected homozygous females. Since the frequency of the dominant allele is 1/100, the frequency of the heterozygous individuals (pq) must be 1/100. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected homozygous females (q^2) is also 1/100.\n\nTo find the expected frequency of affected homozygous females, we can rearrange the Hardy-Weinberg equation:\n\nq^2 = (1/100)^2\n\nq^2 = 1/10000\n\nq = 1/10000\n\nSo, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 10,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1 in 10 000",
