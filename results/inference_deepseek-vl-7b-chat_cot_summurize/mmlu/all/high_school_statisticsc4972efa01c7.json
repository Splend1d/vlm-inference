The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (in this case, the number of loaves baked today), \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score for the number of loaves baked today (3,000 loaves).\n\nz = (3,000 - 2,500) / 225\nz = 500 / 225\nz = 2.1733\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than or equal to 2.1733. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability for a z-score of 2.1733 is approximately 0.0132.\n\nSo, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today is approximately 0.0132, which corresponds to option D.",
