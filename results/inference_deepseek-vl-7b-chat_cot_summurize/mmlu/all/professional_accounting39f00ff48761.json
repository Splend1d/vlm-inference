We can rearrange the formula to solve for net profit:\n\nNet Profit = Net Profit Margin * Total Assets\n\nNet Profit = 0.05 * $300,000\n\nNet Profit = $15,000\n\nNow, we can use the formula for return on total assets:\n\nReturn on Total Assets = Net Profit / Total Assets\n\nWe are given the return on total assets as 8% and the total assets as $300,000. We can rearrange the formula to solve for total assets:\n\nTotal Assets = Return on Total Assets * Net Profit\n\nTotal Assets = 0.08 * $15,000\n\nTotal Assets = $120,000\n\nNow, we can use the formula for sales:\n\nSales = Total Assets * (1 + Net Profit Margin)\n\nWe are given the total assets as $120,000 and the net profit margin as 5%. We can rearrange the formula to solve for sales:\n\nSales = $120,000 * (1 + 0.05)\n\nSales = $120,000 * 1.05\n\nSales = $126,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. $3,750,000.00.",
