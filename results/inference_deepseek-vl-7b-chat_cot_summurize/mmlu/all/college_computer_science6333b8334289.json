Consider the product of three matrices N_1N_2N_3 that have, respectively, w rows and x columns, x rows and y columns, and y rows and z columns. Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)?\n\nA. There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time.\nB. 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y\nC. x > y\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\n",

            "content": "The time complexity of matrix multiplication is given by the formula O(p*q*r) and O(p*r*z) for the first and second cases, respectively. \n\nIn the first case, the time complexity is O(p*q*x*z) and in the second case, it is O(p*r*y*z). \n\nTo find the condition under which the first case is faster, we need to find the condition that makes the time complexity of the first case less than the time complexity of the second case. \n\nComparing the time complexities, we have:\n\np*q*x*z < p*r*y*z\n\nDividing both sides by p*r*y*z, we get:\n\nq*x*z < r*y*z\n\nDividing both sides by r*y*z, we get:\n\nq*x*z/r*y*z < 1\n\nSince q, x, and z are all positive, we can divide both sides by q*x*z:\n\n1 < r*y/z\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\n1/r*y < 1/z\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
