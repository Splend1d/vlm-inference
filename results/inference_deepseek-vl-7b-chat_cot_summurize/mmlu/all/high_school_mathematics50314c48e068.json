            "content": "To find the probability that the result is a composite number, we need to find the probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of the dice is not a prime number.\n\nA prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The only prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, and 53.\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes for each die roll, and since there are 5 dice, there are a total of 6^5 = 7776 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where the product of the numbers on the faces of the dice is a prime number. There are 13 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, and 53), so there are 13 outcomes where the product is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the result is a composite number is 1 - 13/7776 = 7763/7776.\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options.
