Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\nA. De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\nB. Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\nC. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\nD. De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n",

            "content": "The differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts can be best accounted for by the following:\n\nA. De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n\nThis option is plausible because De las Casas's account of the Spanish treatment of the natives is quite negative and seems to be an exaggeration. He describes the Spanish as ravening wolves, tigers, and savage lions, which is a strong and hyperbolic metaphor. This could be an attempt to support his argument against the start of African slavery, as he was a prominent figure in the abolitionist movement.\n\nB. Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n\nWhile it is possible that Columbus was biased in his writings, the passage provided does not give enough evidence to support this claim. Columbus does not seem to be praising himself or his actions, but rather explaining his own actions and intentions.\n\nC. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n\nThis option is not supported by the passage provided. Columbus himself describes his men as barterers who would take whatever the natives gave them, and he himself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles. This does not necessarily mean that his men were nicer to the natives than later expeditions.\n\nD. De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n\nWhile it is possible that De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas, the passage provided does not give enough evidence to support this claim. De las Casas's account of the Spanish treatment of the natives is quite negative, but it does not necessarily mean that he wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n\nTherefore, the best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts is that De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.",
