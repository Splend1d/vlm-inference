The assignments are:\n\nA := B + C\nB := A - B\nC := A * E\nD := A/F\nE := B - C\nF := A + B\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of parallel computing. If we have n identical processors, we can execute the assignments in parallel. This means that each processor will execute one assignment at a time.\n\nLet's analyze the assignments:\n\n1. A := B + C: This assignment can be executed in parallel by each processor.\n2. B := A - B: This assignment can also be executed in parallel by each processor.\n3. C := A * E: This assignment can be executed in parallel by each processor.\n4. D := A/F: This assignment can be executed in parallel by each processor.\n5. E := B - C: This assignment can be executed in parallel by each processor.\n6. F := A + B: This assignment can be executed in parallel by each processor.\n\nSince all the assignments can be executed in parallel by n processors, the minimum number of time units needed to execute the assignments is n. Therefore, the answer is A.",
