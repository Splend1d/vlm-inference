            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the dot product and the angle between two vectors.\n\nThe particle's velocity vector is given by the position vector of the particle at a certain time, which is a function of time. Let's denote the position vector as r(t) and the velocity vector as v(t). The velocity vector is given as 10 m/s, so v(t) = 10 m/s.\n\nThe acceleration vector is given as a(t) = 10 m/s^2.\n\nThe angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is given by the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes.\n\ncos(\u03b8) = (v(t) \u2022 a(t)) / (||v(t)|| ||a(t)||)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the two vectors, v(t) \u2022 a(t) is the dot product of the two vectors, and ||v(t)|| and ||a(t)|| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the velocity and acceleration vectors:\n\nv(t) \u2022 a(t) = 10 m/s * 10 m/s = 100 m^2/s^2\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n||v(t)|| = \u221a(10^2 + 0^2) = \u221a100 = 10 m\n||a(t)|| = \u221a(10^2 + 0^2) = \u221a100 = 10 m\n\nNow, we can find the angle \u03b8:\n\ncos(\u03b8) = (100 m^2/s^2) / (10 m * 10 m) = 100 / 100 = 1\n\nSince cos(\u03b8) = 1, the angle \u03b8 is 0\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
