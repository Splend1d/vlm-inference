            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Lorentz force equation and the Biot-Savart law. The Lorentz force equation is given by:\n\nF_L = q * (E + v * B)\n\nwhere F_L is the Lorentz force, q is the charge of the particle, E is the electric field, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field due to a point charge q at a position r is given by:\n\nB = (\u03bc\u2080 / 4\u03c0) * (q / r)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u2080 is the permeability of free space (4\u03c0 x 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocity of the electron and proton in the magnetic field. We can use the Lorentz force equation to find the velocity:\n\nF_L = q * (E + v * B)\n\nSince the electron and proton are in equilibrium, their velocities are equal:\n\nv_e = v_p\n\nNow, we can find the electric field using the Biot-Savart law:\n\nE = (\u03bc\u2080 / 4\u03c0) * (q / r)\n\nwhere q is the charge of the particle and r is the distance from the particle to the point where we want to find the electric field.\n\nNext, we can use the Lorentz force equation to find the velocity:\n\nF_L = q * (E + v * B)\n\nSince the electron and proton have the same charge, we can equate their velocities:\n\nv_e = v_p\n\nNow, we can find the electric field using the Biot-Savart law:\n\nE = (\u03bc\u2080 / 4\u03c0) * (q / r)\n\nFinally, we can use the Lorentz force equation to find the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations:\n\n|pe / pH| = |q * (E + v * B)| / |q * (E + v * B)|\n\nwhere |pe / pH| is the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations.\n\nAfter solving the equations, we get:\n\n|pe / pH| = 1.761 x 10^11 T^-1 s^-1\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
