The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph?\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\nD. World War II\n",

            "content": "The question is asking which of the given historical events most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph of Mahatma Gandhi's message. The paragraph talks about the importance of remaining non-violent and boycotting foreign cloth, and working towards Swadeshi (self-reliance) and Hindu-Muslim unity.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies: This option is not directly related to the success of the boycott mentioned in the message. The Soviet Union's actions were more focused on their own colonies and did not have a significant impact on India's struggle for independence.\n\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929: The Great Depression was a global economic downturn that started in 1929. While it did have an impact on many countries, it is not directly related to the success of the boycott mentioned in the message. The boycott was more about promoting self-reliance and unity among Indians, not economic conditions.\n\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa: This option is also not directly related to the success of the boycott mentioned in the message. The decolonization process in Africa was happening independently of India's struggle for independence.\n\nD. World War II: World War II was a global conflict that took place from 1939 to 1945. It had a significant impact on many countries, including India. The war led to a shift in global power dynamics, with the British Empire losing its dominance. This shift in power dynamics could have assisted the success of the boycott mentioned in the message, as it may have made it easier for India to gain independence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is D. World War II. The war led to a shift in global power dynamics, which could have assisted the success of the boycott mentioned in the message.",
