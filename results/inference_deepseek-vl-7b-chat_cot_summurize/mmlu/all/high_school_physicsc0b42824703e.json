            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the equations of motion. The position of a body moving in one dimension can be described by the following equation:\n\nx(t) = x0 + v0*t + (1/2)*a*t^2\n\nwhere x(t) is the position of the body at time t, x0 is the initial position, v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nWe are given the initial position x0 = 0, the initial velocity v0 = 24 m/s, and the acceleration a = -6 m/s^2. We want to find the position x(11) at t = 11 seconds.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nx(11) = 0 + 24*11 + (1/2)*(-6)*(11)^2\n\nx(11) = 240 - 132\n\nx(11) = 108\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options. This is likely because the problem statement is incorrect or there is an error in the given information. The correct answer should be 108 meters, which corresponds to option B.",
