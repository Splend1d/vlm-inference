Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\nB. Self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\nC. Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\nD.

Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\n\nThis is because cognitive dissonance theory suggests that people will try to reduce the dissonance (the discrepancy between their beliefs and their behavior) by changing their beliefs to match their behavior. In this case, participants who were paid less to say the experiment was interesting may feel more dissonance, and therefore report greater liking for the experiment to reduce the dissonance.\n\nSelf-perception theory suggests that people's self-image (how they see themselves) can be influenced by their behavior. In this case, participants who were paid less may feel that they are more interested in the experiment than they actually are, and therefore report greater liking for the experiment to maintain their self-image.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either contradict the predictions of cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory, or they suggest that participants in the $20.00 condition will report greater liking for the experiment, which is not consistent with the predictions of these theories.",
