            "content": "The source provided is an inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E. It describes the actions of Hormizd and Bahram, who were both kings of Persia, and how they treated Kerdir, a high-ranking priest of Ahura Mazda.\n\nThe text indicates that Hormizd and Bahram held Kerdir in high honor and dignity, conferred on him higher ranks and titles, and gave him authority and power in matters of divine services. They also established many divine services, Warham fires, and magi became happy and prosperous. This suggests that the rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.\n\nThe text does not mention rulers being limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures, rulers deriving legitimacy through victories over foreign peoples, or rulers deriving legitimacy through the consent of those they governed. Therefore, the source best supports the inference that rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.",
