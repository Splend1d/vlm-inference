This polynomial is irreducible over Q, so it cannot be factored into smaller polynomials with coefficients in Q.\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial x^2 - 2x - 3 + (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))x. We can rewrite this polynomial as (x - sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))x + (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)).\n\nNotice that (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2x - 3 + (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))x + (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)). Therefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 1.\n\nSo, the answer is A.",
