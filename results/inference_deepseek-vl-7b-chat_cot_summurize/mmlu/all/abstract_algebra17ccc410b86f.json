An ideal in a ring is a subset that satisfies the properties of multiplication and additive inverses. Since these properties are preserved under the subset operation, every ideal is a subring of the ring.\n\nStatement 2: Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring. This statement is false. While it is true that every subring of a ring is a subset of the ring, not every subset of a ring is a subring. For example, the empty set and the set containing only the identity element are not subrings of a ring. Therefore, not every subring is an ideal.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. False, True.",
