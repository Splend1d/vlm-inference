            "content": "A farmer who raises hens for egg production wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56 grams. He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\n\nA. Because tis more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nD. Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n",

He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nThe correct conclusion and reason are A and A. The t-test statistic of -1.973 is more extreme than the critical value of -1.96 for a two-tailed test with 17 degrees of freedom (df) at a 5% significance level. Since the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value for 18 degrees of freedom, the farmer should not reject the null hypothesis in this case. However, since the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value for 17 degrees of freedom, the farmer should reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
