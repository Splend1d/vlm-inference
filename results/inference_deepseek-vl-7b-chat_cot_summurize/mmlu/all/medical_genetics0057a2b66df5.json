            "content": "To find the frequency of heterozygotes, we can use the following formula:\n\nheterozygote frequency = (2 * allele1 frequency * allele2 frequency) / (allele1 frequency + allele2 frequency)\n\nIn this case, the allele1 frequency is 0.6 and the allele2 frequency is 0.4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nheterozygote frequency = (2 * 0.6 * 0.4) / (0.6 + 0.4)\nheterozygote frequency = (0.24 * 0.4) / 1.0\nheterozygote frequency = 0.096 / 1.0\nheterozygote frequency = 0.096\n\nSo, the frequency of heterozygotes is 0.096, which is closest to option D. However, since the options are not in order of increasing frequency, we cannot definitively choose D. If we round the value to the nearest whole number, we get 0.1, which corresponds to option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0.1",
