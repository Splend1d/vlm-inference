The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it means that the price level at which firms are willing to supply the same quantity of goods and services has decreased. This is because the factors of production (such as labor and capital) have become relatively cheaper, allowing firms to produce more with the same price level. As a result, the equilibrium price level increases, and the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.",
