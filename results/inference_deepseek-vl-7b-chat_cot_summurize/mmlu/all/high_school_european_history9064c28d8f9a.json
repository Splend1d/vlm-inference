He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nThe document above supports which of the following demands of the Enlightenment philosophes?\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\nB. Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\nC. Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\nD. Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n",

            "content": "The document above supports the demand of the Enlightenment philosophes for religious toleration. Thomas Paine, in his work \"The Age of Reason,\" argues for the right of every individual to their own opinion, regardless of whether it aligns with his own beliefs. He believes that denying this right to others makes one a slave to their current beliefs, as they preclude themselves from changing their mind. He also emphasizes the importance of reason in combating errors of all kinds.\n\nPaine's statement that he believes in one God and no more, and that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and making others happy, aligns with the Enlightenment philosophes' demand for religious toleration. He does not advocate for a specific religion to be adopted by all, but rather supports the right of individuals to believe as they choose.\n\nTherefore, the document supports the demand of the Enlightenment philosophes for religious toleration (Option D).\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
