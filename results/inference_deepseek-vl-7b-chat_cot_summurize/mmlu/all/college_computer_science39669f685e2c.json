Counting distinct values: Given a set of n keys, determine the number of distinct key values.\n\nHash tables are not efficient for counting distinct values in an average-case scenario. This is because the number of distinct key values can be significantly larger than the number of keys, leading to a high probability of collisions. In the worst-case scenario, all keys could be distinct, but in the average case, there will be many collisions, making the time complexity of counting distinct values O(n).",
