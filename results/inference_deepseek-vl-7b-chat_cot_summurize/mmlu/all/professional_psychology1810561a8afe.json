This is because related subjects often share common concepts, ideas, and principles, which can help reinforce and solidify the information in your memory. When you study a related subject, you are essentially reinforcing the connections between the new information and the information you already have, making it easier to recall and understand.\n\nSleeping, exercising, and studying an unrelated subject may also have some benefits, but they are not as effective as studying a related subject in terms of retaining the learned material. Sleeping helps consolidate memories, but it is not a direct method of studying or reinforcing the material. Exercising can improve blood flow to the brain, which may enhance memory, but it is not a direct method of studying or reinforcing the material. Studying an unrelated subject can help you develop a broader understanding of the material, but it may not be as effective as studying a related subject in terms of retaining the information.",
