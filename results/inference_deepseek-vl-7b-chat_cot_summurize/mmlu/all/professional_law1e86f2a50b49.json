Overrule all the objections because the witness is adverse to the plaintiff and therefore may be interrogated by leading questions and subjected to impeachment.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe trial court's role is to ensure that the trial proceeds fairly and that both parties have an opportunity to present their case. In this case, the plaintiff is questioning the managing agent of the defendant corporation, who is a witness for the defendant. The plaintiff is not questioning their own witness, so the objections made by defense counsel are not valid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the trial court should not require the plaintiff to only question the witness during the defendant's case-in-chief. This would not be fair to the plaintiff.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a party is allowed to ask leading questions of their own witness at trial. This is not a violation of any rule or principle of fairness.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a party is allowed to impeach their own witness at trial. This is not a violation of any rule or principle of fairness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Overrule all the objections because the witness is adverse to the plaintiff and therefore may be interrogated by leading questions and subjected to impeachment.",
