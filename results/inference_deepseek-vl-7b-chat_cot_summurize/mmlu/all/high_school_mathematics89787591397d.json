We can start by finding the remainder when 25 is divided by 23:\n\n25 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 1059:\n\n(25^1059) \u2261 (1^1059) (mod 23)\n\nSince 1^1059 is 1, we have:\n\n25^1059 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when 1 is divided by 23:\n\n1 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nSo, the remainder when 25^1059 is divided by 23 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
