            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times in 24 hours that the two computers back up data at the same time.\n\nLet's first find the number of times each computer backs up data in 24 hours.\n\nThe first computer backs up data at the turn of the minute every five minutes. In 24 hours, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes. So, the first computer backs up data 1440 / 5 = 288 times in 24 hours.\n\nThe second computer backs up data at the turn of the minute every two minutes. In 24 hours, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes. So, the second computer backs up data 1440 / 2 = 720 times in 24 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of times the two computers back up data at the same time. We can do this by finding the number of times the first computer backs up data in the same time interval as the second computer.\n\nThe first computer backs up data every 5 minutes, and the second computer backs up data every 2 minutes. So, the first computer backs up data every 5 minutes, and the second computer backs up data every 2 minutes.\n\nIn 24 hours, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes. So, the first computer backs up data 288 times in 24 hours. Therefore, the first computer backs up data every 5 minutes, and the second computer backs up data every 2 minutes.\n\nThe number of times the two computers back up data at the same time is the number of times the first computer backs up data in the same time interval as the second computer.\n\nSo, the number of times the two computers back up data at the same time is 288 / 5 = 57.6.\n\nHowever, since the number of times the two computers back up data at the same time must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the number of times in 24 hours that the two computers back up data at the same time is 57.\n\nHowever, the options given are 144, 12, 6, and 36. None of these options is equal to 57. Therefore, there is no option that represents the correct answer.\n\nThere may be an error in the problem statement or the options provided.",
