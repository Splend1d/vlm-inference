            "content": "A pet breeder is in the business of breeding calves at his cattle ranch where he has a stable of prolific cows who are very fertile. The newborn calves need constant attention and care. One day one of the employees inadvertently leaves the fence door open and a newly-born calf breaks free and goes to his neighbor's land. The breeder went to the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf for its safety and to make sure it was unharmed. However, he was arrested on a trespass charge after entering the land. The breeder appealed. Will the court dismiss the charge?\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\nB. Yes, because the tender pet doctrine allows temporary entry to retrieve baby animals.\nC. No, because the neighbor had a right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land.\nD. No, because his status as a breeder made him unqualified for a limited license.\n",

Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\n\nThe breeder had a legitimate reason to enter the neighbor's land - to retrieve the calf and ensure its safety. The other options do not apply in this situation. The tender pet doctrine does not apply because the calf is not a pet, but rather a livestock animal. The neighbor's right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land does not apply because the breeder had the right to retrieve the calf for its safety. Finally, the breeder's status as a breeder does not disqualify him from having a limited license to enter the land for the purpose of retrieving the calf.",
