The equipment consists of four major components, of which two components comprise 80% of the total cost and each has a 20-year useful life. The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each; one of them has a useful life of four years, and the other has a useful life of five years. The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Under IFRS, what is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1?\n\nA. $4,000,000\nB. $5,000,000\nC. $8,000,000\nD. $8,500,000\n",

            "content": "To calculate the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the equipment.\n2. Calculate the depreciation expense for the two major components with a 20-year useful life.\n3. Calculate the depreciation expense for the two remaining components.\n4. Add the depreciation expenses from steps 2 and 3 to get the total depreciation expense.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of the equipment.\nTotal cost = $100 million\n\nStep 2: Calculate the depreciation expense for the two major components with a 20-year useful life.\nEach major component has a 20-year useful life, so we need to calculate the depreciation expense for each component over 20 years.\nDepreciation expense = (Total cost of major component) / (20 years)\nDepreciation expense = ($100 million) / (20 years)\nDepreciation expense = $5 million per year\n\nSince there are two major components, the total depreciation expense for the major components is:\nTotal depreciation expense for major components = 2 * $5 million = $10 million per year\n\nStep 3: Calculate the depreciation expense for the two remaining components.\nEach remaining component has a useful life of 4 years and 5 years, respectively.\nDepreciation expense for the first remaining component = (Cost of first remaining component) / (4 years)\nDepreciation expense for the first remaining component = $10 million / (4 years)\nDepreciation expense for the first remaining component = $2.5 million per year\n\nDepreciation expense for the second remaining component = (Cost of second remaining component) / (5 years)\nDepreciation expense for the second remaining component = $10 million / (5 years)\nDepreciation expense for the second remaining component = $2 million per year\n\nTotal depreciation expense for the remaining components = 2 * ($2.5 million + $2 million) = $10 million per year\n\nStep 4: Add the depreciation expenses from steps 2 and 3 to get the total depreciation expense.\nTotal depreciation expense = Total depreciation expense for major components + Total depreciation expense for remaining components\nTotal depreciation expense = $10 million + $10 million = $20 million per year\n\nSince the company uses the straight-line method of depreciation, the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, is $20 million.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not match the calculated value.
