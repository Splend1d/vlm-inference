The unconditioned stimulus (UCS) is a stimulus that naturally elicits a response, while the conditioned stimulus (CS) is a previously neutral stimulus that has been paired with the unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned response (CR). The conditioned response is a learned response that occurs in the presence of the conditioned stimulus, and it eventually replaces the unconditioned response.",
