If he rolls a 3 or larger he grabs a quick lighter breakfast. When he cooks himself a big breakfast, there is a 15% chance he will be late for school. If he has a lighter breakfast, there is a 6% chance he will be late for school. What is the probability Semir will be on time for school any given day?\n\nA. 0.09\nB. 0.21\nC. 0.8\nD. 0.91\n",

            "content": "To find the probability that Semir will be on time for school, we need to find the probability that he will not be late for school. The probability of not being late for school is equal to 1 minus the probability of being late for school.\n\nFor a big breakfast, the probability of being late is 0.15. For a lighter breakfast, the probability of being late is 0.06.\n\nSo, the probability of not being late for school when having a big breakfast is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.\nThe probability of not being late for school when having a lighter breakfast is 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of Semir having either a big breakfast or a lighter breakfast. This is the probability of not being late for school plus the probability of being late for school.\n\nThe probability of having a big breakfast is 0.15 (15% chance) and the probability of having a lighter breakfast is 0.85 (85% chance).\n\nSo, the probability of Semir having either a big breakfast or a lighter breakfast is 0.85 + 0.85 = 1.7.\n\nFinally, the probability of Semir being on time for school any given day is 1 minus the probability of him having either a big breakfast or a lighter breakfast.\n\nTherefore, the probability Semir will be on time for school any given day is 1 - 1.7 = 0.3.\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options.
