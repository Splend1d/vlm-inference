            "content": "On June 1, an owner of a business that built mobile homes was visited by a representative of a company that manufactured propane tanks. Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder. The representative told the owner that the company could supply propane tanks at $50 per tank, a substantial savings over what the owner currently paid for propane tanks. The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30. I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount. I will have $45,000 cash ready to give to your representative at the time of delivery. \"On June 30, the company delivered 1,000 propane tanks to the owner. The representative accompanied the delivery and presented the owner with a bill for $50,000. The owner refused to pay any more than$45,000. Which of the following accurately states the legal rights of the parties?\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\nB. The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n",

            "content": "The legal rights of the parties in this situation can be determined by examining the contract and the actions of both parties. The contract between the owner and the company was not explicitly stated in the memo, but it can be inferred from the context. The owner agreed to purchase 1,000 propane tanks at $50 per tank, and the company agreed to supply them. The owner also mentioned a 10 percent discount for cash payment, which implies that the price would be reduced by 10 percent.\n\nThe owner's memo stated that he would have $45,000 cash ready for the delivery, which suggests that he intended to pay the discounted price of $45,000. The company delivered the propane tanks on June 30, and the representative presented the owner with a bill for $50,000. The owner refused to pay any more than $45,000, which is the discounted price he had agreed to pay.\n\nThe company did not object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo. Therefore, the contract price was not $50,000, as the company did not object to the discount. The contract price was not explicitly stated in the memo, but it can be inferred from the context that the owner intended to pay the discounted price of $45,000.\n\nThe contract price was not $45,000 either, as the owner had agreed to pay the discounted price of $45,000. The contract price was not $50,000, as the company did not object to the discount and the owner had agreed to pay the discounted price of $45,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n\nThis answer is incorrect because the company did not object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo, and the owner had agreed to pay the discounted price of $45,000.",
