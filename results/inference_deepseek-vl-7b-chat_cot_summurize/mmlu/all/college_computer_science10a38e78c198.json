            "content": "The problem is asking for the maximum possible degree of the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial p(x) for the given function f(x) at the n + 1 distinct real numbers x0, ..., xn.\n\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x in the polynomial. In this case, the polynomial p(x) is an interpolating polynomial, which means it passes through all the given points (x0, f(x0)), (x1, f(x1)), ..., (xn, f(xn)).\n\nSince the polynomial p(x) must pass through all the given points, it must have at least the same degree as the highest degree of any of the given points. In other words, the degree of p(x) must be at least the maximum of the degrees of the given points.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible degree of p(x) is the maximum of the degrees of the given points, which is n.\n\nSo, the answer is A. n.",
