The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?\n\nA. The man was not aware of the ordinance.\nB. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.\nC. The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.\nD. The driver is not a resident of the city.\n",

This fact would establish that the driver was aware of the ordinance and should have known that washing a car on the street was prohibited. If the driver knew about the ordinance and still chose to drive on the street, it would be difficult for the driver to claim that the man was negligent per se. The other options do not provide as much support for the man's defense. Option A would not help the man, as ignorance of the ordinance would not absolve him of responsibility. Option B would not help the man either, as the reason for the ordinance would not affect the man's responsibility for the accident. Option D would not help the man, as the driver's residency status would not affect the man's responsibility for the accident.",
