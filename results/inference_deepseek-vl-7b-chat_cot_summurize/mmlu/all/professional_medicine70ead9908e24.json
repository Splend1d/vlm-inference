Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase\nB. Ca2+ channels\nC. Janus kinase\nD. Serine kinase\n",

This enzyme is involved in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance in the body, and its activation can help increase urine osmolality, which in turn can help alleviate symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.",
