Calculate the gain on the new house by subtracting the cost basis from the purchase price.\n3. Compare the two gains to determine the overall gain.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the capital gain\nCapital gain = Net proceeds - Cost basis\nCapital gain = $500,000 - $200,000\nCapital gain = $300,000\n\nStep 2: Calculate the gain on the new house\nPurchase price of the new house = $600,000\nCost basis of the new house = $0 (since it was purchased within six months of the sale)\nGain on the new house = Purchase price - Cost basis\nGain on the new house = $600,000 - $0\nGain on the new house = $600,000\n\nStep 3: Compare the two gains\nOverall gain = Capital gain + Gain on the new house\nOverall gain = $300,000 + $600,000\nOverall gain = $900,000\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. $300,000.",
