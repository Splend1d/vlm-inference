The state has recently enacted a statute that prohibits the showing of any obscene film in an area open to the public. The owner of the motel is prosecuted for violating the statute by showing pornographic movies in the motel rooms. On appeal, the owner's conviction will probably be\n\nA. sustained, because a state can use its police power to prohibit the showing of pornography in public areas.\nB. sustained, because a state may use local standards in determining whether a movie has redeeming literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit.\nC. overturned, because his prosecution violates the right of consenting adultsto view such films in private.\nD. overturned, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the suppression of sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly obscene contents.\n",

The Fourteenth Amendment also protects individuals from being treated differently based on their speech or expression. In this case, the owner of the motel is being prosecuted for showing adult movies, which are considered sexually oriented materials. The state's statute prohibits the showing of any obscene film in an area open to the public. However, the owner is only showing these movies in private rooms, where consenting adults are occupying them. Therefore, the prosecution is likely to be overturned because the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the right of consenting adults to view such films in private.",
