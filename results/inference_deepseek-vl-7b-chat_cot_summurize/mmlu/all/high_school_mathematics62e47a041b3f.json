Let's denote the distance to the east as a, the distance north as b, the distance west as c, and the distance south as d.\n\nThe person walked 3 miles to the east, so a = 3.\nThe person walked 10 miles north, so b = 10.\nThe person walked 6 miles west, so c = -6 (since west is negative).\nThe person walked 16 miles south, so d = 16.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \u2248 (3)^2 + (10)^2 + (-6)^2 + (16)^2\n\n3^2 + 10^2 + (-6)^2 + 16^2 \u2248 9 + 100 + 36 + 256\n\n9 + 100 + 36 + 256 \u2248 381\n\nNow, we can approximate the distance from the starting point:\n\n\u221a(381) \u2248 19.2\n\nSo, the person is approximately 19.2 miles away from his starting point. However, the options given are not close to this value. The closest option is B. 6.7, which is approximately 12.8 miles away from the starting point.",
