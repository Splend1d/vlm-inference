So, when people commit the fundamental attribution error, they tend to ignore or de-emphasize situational factors (option B) and social factors (option C). They also tend to ignore or de-emphasize cognitive factors (option D) that may influence behavior. However, they may not necessarily ignore dispositional factors (option A) entirely, as they may still attribute behavior to personality traits to some extent.",
