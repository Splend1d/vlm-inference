The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration. Genetic studies show a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. If the two-gene deletion is in trans (one deletion on the maternal gene and one deletion on the paternal gene), which of the following percentages of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion?\n\nA. 0%\nB. 25%\nC. 50%\nD. 75%\n",

            "content": "The question is asking for the percentage of offspring that will have a two-gene deletion if the two-gene deletion is in trans, meaning one deletion is on the maternal gene and one deletion is on the paternal gene.\n\nIn this case, the woman has a single gene deletion, which means she has one mutation. The man has a two-gene deletion, which means he has two mutations. If the two-gene deletion is in trans, it means that the two mutations are not inherited from the same parent.\n\nIn this scenario, the offspring will inherit one mutation from each parent. Since the woman has a single gene deletion, the offspring will have one mutation from her. The man has two mutations, but since the two-gene deletion is in trans, the offspring will only inherit one of the mutations from him.\n\nTherefore, the offspring will have one mutation from each parent, which means they will have a two-gene deletion.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 50%.",
