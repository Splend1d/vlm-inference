In the case of the ring Z_3 x 3Z, the identity element is (0, 0) and the zero element is (0, 0).\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. 0: If the characteristic is 0, then 0 times the identity element should be the zero element. However, 0 times (0, 0) is (0, 0), which is not the zero element.\n\nB. 3: If the characteristic is 3, then 3 times the identity element should be the zero element. In this case, 3 times (0, 0) is (0, 0), which is the zero element. Therefore, the characteristic of Z_3 x 3Z is 3.\n\nC. 12: This is not a valid option.\n\nD. 30: This is not a valid option.\n\nSo, the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x 3Z is 3. The correct answer is B.",
