Marginal utility, on the other hand, refers to the additional satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming one more unit of a good.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Plastic: Plastic is a common household item that is used for various purposes, such as packaging, storage, and manufacturing. It is unlikely to provide a large total utility because it is a basic necessity and most people already have access to it. However, the marginal utility of plastic is likely to be small, as the additional satisfaction from using one more unit of plastic is minimal.\n\nB. Automobiles: Automobiles provide a large total utility because they are a means of transportation and are essential for many people's daily lives. The marginal utility of automobiles is likely to be large, as the additional satisfaction from using one more unit of automobile is significant, especially in areas with poor public transportation.\n\nC. Computers: Computers provide a large total utility because they are used for various purposes, such as communication, entertainment, and work. The marginal utility of computers is likely to be large, as the additional satisfaction from using one more unit of computer is significant, especially in the context of technological advancement.\n\nD. Air: Air is a basic necessity for human life, and its total utility is likely to be large because it is essential for survival. The marginal utility of air is likely to be small, as the additional satisfaction from breathing one more unit of air is minimal.\n\nBased on this analysis, the goods that are likely to provide both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility are automobiles and air. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we can choose either of these two options.",
