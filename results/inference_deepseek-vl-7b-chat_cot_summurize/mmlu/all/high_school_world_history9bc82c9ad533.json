The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage.

Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal.

One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following statements about ancient cities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph?\n\nA.
