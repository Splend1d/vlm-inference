This means that the gravitational pull of the black hole would be the same as the Sun's gravitational pull. Therefore, the orbits of the planets would remain unchanged.\n\nA. The planets would move directly toward the Sun: This is incorrect because the gravitational pull of the black hole would be the same as the Sun's, so the planets would not move toward the black hole.\n\nB.
