They are both part of the electromagnetic induction family of devices, which means they both use electromagnetic fields to produce mechanical energy. Motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, while generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. However, they are similar in that they both use the same basic principles of electromagnetic induction.",
