We know that Mike finished the race at 4:02 p.m. and Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike.\n\nTo find the time that Joe finished the race, we need to subtract 4 minutes from the time that Mike finished the race.\n\n4:02 p.m. - 4 minutes = 4:02 p.m. - 0:04 = 3:58 p.m.\n\nTherefore, Joe finished the race at 3:58 p.m.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 3:58 p.m.",
