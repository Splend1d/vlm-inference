In this case, the basis is $6,000 and the FMV is $20,000. \n\nGain = FMV - Basis\nGain = $20,000 - $6,000\nGain = $14,000\n\nHowever, there is a $12,000 liability associated with the equipment. This means that the shareholder must reduce the gain by the liability. \n\nRecognized gain = $14,000 - $12,000\nRecognized gain = $2,000\n\nSo, the shareholder must recognize a gain of $2,000.
