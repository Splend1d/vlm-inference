Calculate the total amount due:\nThe total amount due is the cost of the sofas, which is $7,000.\n\n2. Apply the terms of the invoice:\nThe terms of the invoice are 2/10, which means 2% is due within 10 days, and n/30, which means the remaining 98% is due within 30 days.\n\nSince the invoice was paid on August 13, which is 30 days after the invoice date, the store only needs to pay the remaining 98% of the total amount due.\n\n2.1 Calculate the 2% due within 10 days:\n2% of $7,000 is (2/100) * $7,000 = $140.\n\n2.2 Calculate the remaining 98% due:\n98% of $7,000 is (98/100) * $7,000 = $6,860.\n\n3. Add the 2% due and the remaining 98% due:\n$140 (2%) + $6,860 (98%) = $6,900.\n\nThe store paid $6,900.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $6,860",
