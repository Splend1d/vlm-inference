            "content": "The WISC (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children) is a widely used intelligence test that assesses various cognitive abilities in children. The test scores are typically reported in percentile ranks, which indicate the proportion of children who scored below the examinee.\n\nTo estimate the percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130 on the WISC, we need to know the total number of examinees and the number of examinees in the specified range. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the question.\n\nHowever, we can make some general observations based on the WISC scoring system. The WISC has a total possible score of 135, with 135 being the maximum score and 0 being the minimum score. The test is divided into four subtests:\n\n1. Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI)\n2. Performance IQ (PIQ)\n3. Working Memory (WMI)\n4. Processing Speed (PSI)\n\nThe average score on the WISC is around 100, and the average score on each subtest is approximately:\n\n1. VCI: 100\n2. PIQ: 100\n3. WMI: 100\n4. PSI: 100\n\nGiven that the average score is 100, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of examinees will score below the average. However, without specific data on the distribution of scores, we cannot accurately estimate the percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130 on the WISC.\n\nIf you have access to the raw data or a more detailed description of the distribution of scores, you could use statistical methods to estimate the percentage. Otherwise, the best answer would be to provide the specific data or context that would allow for a more accurate estimation.",
