He immediately sent a purchase order which stated \"our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF.\"\u009d Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated \"Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes.\" If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:\n\nA. A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.\nB. A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.\nC. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\nD. No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n",

            "content": "The court would likely rule that the contract relationship is at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included. \n\nThis is because the order confirmation from Costco stated that the envelope order acceptance is conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes. This means that the total cost of the envelopes, including the $1,000 CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) and the $50 per thousand envelopes loading charge, would be $1,500. \n\nThe purchase order from Rainmaking did not include the loading charges, so it would not be considered a valid contract if the court were to rule based on the offer terms CIF. Additionally, the order confirmation from Costco was not a counteroffer, but rather a condition of the original offer, so it would not be considered a counteroffer that was not accepted. Finally, the mirror image rule does not apply in this case because the purchase order and the order confirmation are not identical, but rather represent different conditions of the original offer.",
