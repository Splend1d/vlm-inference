In this case, the UCS is the nausea, and the CS is the food or drink. The pairing of nausea with food or drink creates a learned aversion, meaning that the mere presence of food or drink will cause a feeling of nausea, which is the conditioned response. This pairing is considered the most powerful and learned quickly because it is a strong emotional response that can be quickly reinforced through conditioning.",
