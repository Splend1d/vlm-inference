            "content": "In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, the total initial kinetic energy of the two particles is given by:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * (2m * v^2 + m * v^2)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity of the particles before the collision. Since the particle of mass m is at rest, its velocity is 0. Therefore, the total initial kinetic energy becomes:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * (2m * 0 + m * 0)\n\nSince the particle of mass 2m is at rest, its velocity is 0. Therefore, the total initial kinetic energy becomes:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * (2 * 0 + 1 * 0)\n\nKE_initial = 0\n\nSince the total initial kinetic energy is 0, the final kinetic energy of the two particles after the collision is also 0. Therefore, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is:\n\nFraction lost = (Initial KE - Final KE) / Initial KE\n\nFraction lost = (0 - 0) / 0\n\nFraction lost = 0 / 0\n\nSince the fraction is undefined, it means that the initial kinetic energy is not lost in the collision. Therefore, the answer is A. 0.",
