From past experience, the agency knows that 20% of all the workers it places will no longer be at the position in which they were placed after one year; however, only 5% of those remaining after the first year leave during the next year. At the start of a year an employer hires 100 workers using this agency, then at the start of the next year the employer hires 100 more. How many of these 200 workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year?\n\nA. 140\nB. 144\nC. 152\nD. 156\n",
