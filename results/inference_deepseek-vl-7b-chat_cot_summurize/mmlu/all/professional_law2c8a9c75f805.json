As he was about to leave for eight weeks of basic training, his father said, \"I will buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise me not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at basic training. \" The son replied, \"You can order the new car right away. I promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol, as you requested. \"At the end of basic training, the son was given a leave and returned home. His father asked, \"Did you abide by your promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol?\" The son replied, \"Yes, Father. \" The father then told the son that he had already ordered the new car and that it would be available for delivery within one month. One week later, the son received the tragic news that his father had died suddenly. At the funeral, the executor of the father's estate told the son that he did not feel compelled to give the son the newly arrived car. In a suit against the executor of the father's estate to recover the new car, the son will\n\nA. succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.\nB. succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.\nC. not succeed, because the father's promise was only a conditional gift.\nD. not succeed, because the father's promise was void.\n",

Since the son fulfilled his part of the agreement, the father's promise should be considered binding and the son should be entitled to the new car. The fact that the father's promise was conditional does not negate the consideration provided by the son.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the son's promise was not conditional. It was a promise to refrain from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol, regardless of whether the father's promise to buy him a new car was fulfilled.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the father's promise was not void. A promise can be void if it is made under duress or is against public policy, but in this case, there is no indication that either of those conditions was met.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the son's promise to refrain from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol was not sufficient consideration. The father's promise to buy the son a new car was the consideration, not the son's promise.",
