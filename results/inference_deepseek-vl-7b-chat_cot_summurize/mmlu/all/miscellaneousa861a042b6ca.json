Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in price.\n\nA. Water: Water is a necessity for life, and its demand is relatively inelastic. People need water regardless of the price, so changes in price have a limited impact on the quantity demanded.\n\nB. Bread: Bread is a staple food, and its demand is also relatively inelastic. People need bread to survive, so changes in price have a limited impact on the quantity demanded.\n\nC. Salt: Salt is another necessity for life, and its demand is also relatively inelastic. People need salt to maintain their bodily functions, so changes in price have a limited impact on the quantity demanded.\n\nD. Pork: Pork is a luxury item, and its demand is highly elastic. When the price of pork increases, people are more likely to switch to other meats or substitute products, such as chicken or fish, which have a lower price. This results in a significant decrease in the quantity demanded.\n\nBased on this analysis, the demand for pork is likely to be the most elastic.",
