She was studying in the law library and decided to take a short refreshment break. When she returned to her study desk ten minutes later, her Primer Series was gone. She ran into the student lounge and announced, \"I will pay $20 to anyone who identifies the dirty bum who took my Primer Series MBE Review books.\"\u009d Donna Doubtful saw Terry Thief pick up Sarah's Primer Series books, but did not believe Sarah would actually pay her the $20, if she made the identification. Thus, Donna went up to Sarah and said, \"I know the identity of the thief and promise to tell you, but I want the $20 in advance.\"\u009d The effect of Donna's statement is to\n\nA. Create a unilateral contract.\nB. Create a bilateral contract.\nC. Create no contract.\nD. Create a contract which is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time.\n",

            "content": "A unilateral contract is a contract that is made when one party promises to pay or reward the other party for a specific action. In this case, Donna promises to tell Sarah the identity of the thief in exchange for $20. This creates a unilateral contract because only one party, Donna, is making a promise.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nB. A bilateral contract involves mutual promises between two parties. In this case, only Donna is making a promise, not both parties.\n\nC. A contract that is not created is not applicable here because a contract has been formed between Donna and Sarah.\n\nD. A contract that is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time is not applicable here because there is no mention of a time limit for Donna to make the disclosure.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Create a unilateral contract.",
