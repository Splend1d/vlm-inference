            "content": "A traffic accident occurred at a road intersection. A motorcycle, a car, and a truck were involved. The motorcyclist was injured and brought suit against the driver of the car and the driver of the truck. The jury returned a verdict finding that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three of the parties. The jury assigned 55 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the motorcyclist, 25 percent to the driver of the car, and 20 percent to the driver of the truck. The jury found that the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries was$100,000. The motorcyclist enforces the judgment against the driver of the car and collects $45,000 from the driver of the car. If the driver of the car then brings an action against the driver of the truck for contribution, the driver of the car should\n\nA. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the driver of the truck.\nB. recover $27,000.\nC. recover $20,000.\nD. recover $15,000.\n",

            "content": "The driver of the car should recover $20,000.\n\nThis is because the jury assigned 25 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the driver of the car, and the motorcyclist collected $45,000 from the driver of the car. Therefore, the driver of the car should recover the remaining 75 percent of the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries, which is $100,000 - $45,000 = $55,000. Since the driver of the car is 25 percent at fault, the driver of the car should recover 25 percent of the remaining amount, which is 25 percent of $55,000 = $13,750. However, the driver of the car should also recover the amount that the driver of the truck is responsible for, which is 20 percent of the remaining amount, or 20 percent of $13,750 = $2,750. Therefore, the driver of the car should recover a total of $13,750 + $2,750 = $16,500 from the driver of the truck. However, the driver of the car has already collected $45,000 from the driver of the truck, so the driver of the car should recover the remaining amount from the driver of the truck, which is $16,500 - $45,000 = $29,500. Therefore, the driver of the car should recover $29,500 from the driver of the truck.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
