The formula is:\n\nNew score = Standardized score * (Old score / 100)\n\nIn this case, the standardized score is 2.40, and the old score is 100 (since the time is in seconds).\n\nNew score = 2.40 * (100 / 100)\nNew score = 2.40\n\nSo, the student's standardized score will be 2.40 when the times are all changed to minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. z = 2.40.",
