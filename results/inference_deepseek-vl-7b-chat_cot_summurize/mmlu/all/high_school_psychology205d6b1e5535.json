While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?\n\nA. Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nB. Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nC. Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.\nD. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.\n",

Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\n\nThis answer is correct because it explains that rods, which are responsible for color vision, need more light to be activated. On the other hand, cones, which are responsible for black, white, and gray vision, can function in dim light. This is why Lizette can no longer distinguish the colors of objects when walking home in the increasing darkness.",
