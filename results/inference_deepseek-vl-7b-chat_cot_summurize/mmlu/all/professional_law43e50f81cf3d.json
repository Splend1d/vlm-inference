The contract stated:\"The painting is to be done during the month of June, and payment is to be made within one week after the painting is completed. The rights under this contact are not to be assigned. \"The painter started the painting on June 1. On June 10, the painter assigned to his nephew the right to receive payment on the painter's contract with the homeowner. Which of the following statements is most accurate with regard to the painter's assignment to his nephew?\n\nA. The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.\nB. Since personal service contracts of this nature are nonassignable, the homeowner would be under no duty to pay the nephew.\nC. The assignment would constitute a novation, relieving the homeowner of liability.\nD. The assignment would be irrevocable if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is B. Since personal service contracts of this nature are nonassignable, the homeowner would be under no duty to pay the nephew.\n\nExplanation:\nA contract is nonassignable if the contract itself states that the rights under the contract cannot be transferred to another party. In this case, the contract between the homeowner and the painter clearly states that the rights under the contract are not to be assigned. Therefore, the painter cannot transfer his rights to his nephew, and the homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the homeowner would still be obligated to pay the painter, not the nephew.\nOption C is incorrect because a novation would involve a new contract replacing the original contract, and the painter's assignment would not constitute a novation.\nOption D is incorrect because the assignment would not be irrevocable just because it was reduced to writing and signed by the painter. The contract's nonassignability clause would still apply.",
