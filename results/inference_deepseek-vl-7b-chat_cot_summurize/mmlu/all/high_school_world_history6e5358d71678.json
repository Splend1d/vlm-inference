Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\nInstructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512\nThe tone of the first letter best reflects which of the following developments in early modern Africa?\n\nA. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods\nB. Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest\nC. The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline\nD. The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa\n",

            "content": "The tone of the first letter reflects a situation where the Kingdom of Kongo is facing a significant problem due to the trade with Portugal. The Portuguese traders are bringing goods from their Kingdoms, and the Kongo people are very interested in these goods. However, this interest leads to the kidnapping of Kongo people, including freed and exempt men, and even noblemen and relatives, to be sold to the white men in their kingdoms. This indicates a situation where the Kongo people are being exploited by the Portuguese traders, and the trade is causing more harm than good.\n\nThe second letter, from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, shows that the Portuguese are not interested in the well-being of the Kongo people. They only care about making a profit from the trade, and they are willing to exploit the Kongo people to do so. This shows that the Portuguese are not interested in establishing a good relationship with the Kongo people, but rather in using them for their own gain.\n\nTherefore, the tone of the first letter best reflects the development of a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods (Option A). The letter shows that the Kongo people are being exploited by the Portuguese traders, and that the trade is causing more harm than good. The letter does not reflect any of the other options provided.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
