Since there are 6 millicoulombs of charge on each plate, the total charge on the capacitor is 12 millicoulombs (6 mC \u00d7 2). The voltage (V) can be found using the formula:\n\nV = Q / C\n\nwhere Q is the charge and C is the capacitance.\n\nV = 12 mC / 30 mF\nV = 0.4 V\n\nNow we can find the energy stored in the capacitor:\n\nEnergy = Voltage \u00d7 Capacitance\nEnergy = 0.4 V \u00d7 30 mF\nEnergy = 12.0 \u00d7 10^-6 J\n\nThe energy stored in the capacitor is most nearly 12.0 \u00d7 10^-6 J, which is option D.",
