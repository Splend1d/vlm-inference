He was a highly respected philosopher and educator during that time, and his teachings emphasized the importance of compassion and helping others in need. While the Buddha and Laozi were also influential figures, they were more associated with spiritual and philosophical matters, respectively, rather than direct relief from natural disasters. The Queen Mother of the West was a mythological figure and not a real person during the Han Dynasty.",
