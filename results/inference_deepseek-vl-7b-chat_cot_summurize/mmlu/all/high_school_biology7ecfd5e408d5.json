However, the environments are very similar except that some ponds contain predatory fish, while others do not. In high predation ponds, selection has favored the evolution of a body shape that enables rapid bursts of speed. In low predation ponds, another body type is favored\u2014one that is well-suited to swim for long periods of time.\n\nA. Reproductive isolation caused geographic isolation.\nB.
