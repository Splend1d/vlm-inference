            "content": "To calculate Prime's current-year taxable income, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Add the reported book income before federal income taxes to the corporate bond interest income: $300,000 + $170,000 = $470,000\n2. Subtract the term life insurance premiums from the total income: $470,000 - $20,000 = $450,000\n\nSo, Prime's current-year taxable income as reconciled on Prime's Schedule M-1 Reconciliation of Income (Loss) per Books With Income per Return of Form 1120 U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return is $450,000.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match this calculation.
