            "content": "A transmembrane protein is a protein that spans the cell membrane, allowing it to interact with both the interior and exterior of the cell. These proteins are typically composed of hydrophobic amino acids, which means they repel water and prefer to interact with other hydrophobic molecules.\n\nGlycine, Tyrosine, and Isoleucine are all polar amino acids, meaning they have a positive or negative charge depending on the specific atom they are attached to. These amino acids are more likely to be found in the protein's interior, where they can interact with other polar amino acids and form hydrogen bonds.\n\nArginine, on the other hand, is a nonpolar amino acid. It has no charge and is hydrophobic, which means it repels water and prefers to interact with other nonpolar molecules. Since transmembrane proteins are typically composed of hydrophobic amino acids, it is more likely that arginine would be found in the transmembrane domain of a transmembrane protein.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Arginine.",
