This is because the operation of the homomorphic image is determined by the structure of the original cyclic group, which is a cyclic group itself.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\nThis statement is also true. The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is also an Abelian group. This is because the operation of the homomorphic image is determined by the structure of the original Abelian group, which is Abelian itself.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.
