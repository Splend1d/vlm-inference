Since the rock weighs 5 N out of water and 3 N when submerged in water, the volume of the rock must change when it is submerged. \n\nWhen the rock is submerged, the water it displaces forms a column of water that is lighter than the rock itself. The weight of this column of water is equal to the weight of the rock. Therefore, the buoyant force on the rock is equal to the weight of the water it displaces, which is 5 N.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5 N",
