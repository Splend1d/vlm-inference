This is because the verse is written by Senegalese poet L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor, who is using Western literary form (poetry) to express his thoughts and feelings about New York. This shows that he is adapting this form to express his own cultural and personal experiences, which is a key characteristic of this cultural development.\n\nThe other options do not fit as well because:\nA. The triumph of avant-garde literary styles over traditional realism does not fit because the verse is not an avant-garde literary style, but rather a traditional form of poetry.\nC. The political use of art and literature for propagandistic purposes does not fit because the verse does not seem to be used for any specific political agenda.\nD. The response of interwar literary figures to the horrors of World War I does not fit because the verse does not seem to be a response to any specific event or issue related to World War I.",
