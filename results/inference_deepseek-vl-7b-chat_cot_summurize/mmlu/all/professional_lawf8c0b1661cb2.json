A lawyer for the movie studio negotiated an agreement with the screenwriter whereby the movie studio would pay the screenwriter $5,000 for the rights to the screenplay, and 10 percent of the gross receipts earned by the distribution of the movie, should the studio decide to film the screenplay. Both sides signed the agreement. Two weeks later, the screenwriter was at a birthday party for a close friend when she discovered she had forgotten to purchase a gift for her friend. She quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it:\"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay. \"The screenwriter then signed the paper, placed it in an envelope, and handed it to the friend. The promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend may best be interpreted as a (an)\n\nA. equitable lien.\nB. conditional assignment.\nC. irrevocable assignment.\nD. gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n",

            "content": "The screenwriter's promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend can best be interpreted as a (an) equitable lien. An equitable lien is a legal claim that arises when one person (the lienor) has a right to receive payment from another person (the debtor) for a debt or obligation. In this case, the screenwriter has a right to receive payment from the movie studio for the distribution of the movie based on the agreement they signed. By promising to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend, the screenwriter is creating an equitable lien over those proceeds. This means that if the screenwriter receives payment from the movie studio, the friend would also be entitled to receive a portion of that payment under the terms of the promise.",
