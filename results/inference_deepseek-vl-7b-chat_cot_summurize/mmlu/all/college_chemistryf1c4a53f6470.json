This is because the molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and two chlorine atoms. The sulfur atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms through double bonds, which are arranged in a linear fashion, while the chlorine atoms are bonded to the sulfur atom through single bonds. The overall shape of the molecule is linear, with the sulfur atom at the center and the oxygen and chlorine atoms on opposite ends. This linear arrangement of atoms results in a trigonal planar molecular geometry.",
