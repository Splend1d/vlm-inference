            "content": "To find the acceleration of the object, we need to find the derivative of the position equation with respect to time (t). This will give us the velocity equation. Then, we can find the derivative of the velocity equation with respect to time to get the acceleration equation.\n\nThe position equation is: x = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of x with respect to t, which represents the velocity equation:\n\nv = dx/dt = d(2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nv = 6.0t^2 + 4.0\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the velocity equation with respect to t, which represents the acceleration equation:\n\na = dv/dt = d(6.0t^2 + 4.0)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\na = 12.0t\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration at t = 1.50 s by plugging in the value of t into the acceleration equation:\n\na = 12.0(1.50)\n\na = 18 m/s^2\n\nSo, the acceleration of the object at t = 1.50 s is 18 m/s^2.
