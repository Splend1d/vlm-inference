Since there are 6 edges, each edge can connect 2 nodes, and each node can be part of at most 2 connected components. Therefore, the maximum number of connected components is 10 * (1/2) = 5.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum number of connected components (m). Since there are 6 edges, each edge can connect 2 nodes, and each node can be part of at most 2 connected components. Therefore, the minimum number of connected components is 10 * (1/2) = 5.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility of a graph with no selfloops and at most one edge between any pair of nodes. In this case, the minimum number of connected components is 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. M = 6, m = 4.",
