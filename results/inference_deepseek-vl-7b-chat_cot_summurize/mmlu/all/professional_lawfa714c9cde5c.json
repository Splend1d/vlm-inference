They retained a reverter back to themselves, however, as follows: \"RESERVATION in favor of the Grantors, their heirs and assigns, an automatic reverter, should the property conveyed herein ever be mortgaged or encumbered within the life time of either Grantor.\" After husband died, the niece mortgaged the property. Can the surviving wife enforce the automatic reverter putting title back in herself?\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\nC. Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari mutual.\nD. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n",
