The 'C' in strA is lower than the 'c' in strB, so strA is less than strB.\n\n- strB.compareTo(strC) < 0: This is true because strB is \"Carrot\" and strC is \"car\". The 'r' in strB is lower than the 'r' in strC, so strB is less than strC.\n\n- strB.compareTo(strA) < 0: This is true because strB is \"Carrot\" and strA is \"CARROT\". The 'C' in strA is lower than the 'c' in strB, so strB is less than strA.\n\nSo, all three conditions are true, and the answer is A.",
