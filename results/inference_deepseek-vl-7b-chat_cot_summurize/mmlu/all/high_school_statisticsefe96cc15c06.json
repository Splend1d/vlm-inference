            "content": "To find the highest amount of rainfall this city could have this month for it to be among the 10% driest months, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile of the normal distribution.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the 10th percentile of the normal distribution. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this value. The 10th percentile is approximately 0.90.\n\nNext, we can plug in the given values into the z-score formula:\n\nz = (0.90 - 6) / 1.6\nz = (-5.1) / 1.6\nz \u2248 -3.25\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding value in the normal distribution table or calculator. The z-score of -3.25 corresponds to an X value of approximately 3.95 inches.\n\nTherefore, the highest amount of rainfall this city could have this month for it to be among the 10% driest months is approximately 3.95 inches.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3.95",
