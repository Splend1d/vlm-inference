The Q-factor is given by the formula:\n\nQ = BW / 4\u03c0f0\n\nwhere f0 is the resonant frequency of the cavity. However, you have only provided the resonator bandwidth (BW = 1.58 MHz) and one of the options (A. Q = 1012). We cannot determine the resonant frequency (f0) from the given information.\n\nIf you can provide the resonant frequency (f0) or any other relevant information, I can help you calculate the Q-factor.",
