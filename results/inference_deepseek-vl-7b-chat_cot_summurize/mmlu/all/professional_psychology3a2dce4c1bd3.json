However, I can provide some information on the topic.\n\nSchizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While there is a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, the exact risk factors and mechanisms are not fully understood.\n\nSome studies have suggested that the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher in the siblings of someone with the disorder, with estimates ranging from 2-10% depending on the study. However, it is important to note that this risk is not absolute and that many people with a family history of schizophrenia do not develop the disorder.\n\nIn summary, while there is a higher risk of developing schizophrenia in the siblings of someone with the disorder, the exact probability cannot be determined without more information.",
