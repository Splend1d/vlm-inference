Calculate the total revenue for selling 400000 units at $200 each:\nTotal revenue = 400000 units * $200 per unit = $8,000,000\n\n2. Calculate the total revenue for selling 5000 units at different prices:\n- Selling price = $200 per unit\n- Shipping cost = $10 per unit\n- Licensing fee = $50000 per year\n\nFor 5000 units:\nTotal revenue = 5000 units * $200 per unit = $1,000,000\n\n3. Calculate the total revenue for selling 5000 units at different prices, with no shipping costs:\nTotal revenue = 5000 units * $200 per unit = $1,000,000\n\n4. Calculate the total revenue for selling 5000 units at different prices, with no licensing fee:\nTotal revenue = 5000 units * $200 per unit = $1,000,000\n\n5. Compare the total revenues for different prices:\n- Total revenue for 400000 units = $8,000,000\n- Total revenue for 5000 units with shipping costs = $1,000,000\n- Total revenue for 5000 units with no shipping costs = $1,000,000\n\nThe lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno is the price that results in the lowest total revenue. In this case, the lowest price is $190 per unit (option C).",
