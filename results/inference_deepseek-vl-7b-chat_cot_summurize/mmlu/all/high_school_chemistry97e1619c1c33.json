Na2SO3 + FeCl2\nNa2SO3 is a strong base, and FeCl2 is a weak acid. In this reaction, Na2SO3 will completely dissociate into Na+ and SO3^2-. FeCl2 will also dissociate into Fe^2+ and 2Cl-. The net ionic equation will be:\nNa+ + SO3^2- + 2Fe^2+ + 4Cl- -> Na2SO3 + 2FeCl3\n\nB. CaCl2 + MnSO4\nCaCl2 is a strong base, and MnSO4 is a weak acid. In this reaction, CaCl2 will completely dissociate into Ca^2+ and 2Cl-. MnSO4 will also dissociate into Mn^2+ and SO4^2-. The net ionic equation will be:\nCa^2+ + 2Cl- + Mn^2+ + 2SO4^2- -> CaSO4 + MnCl2\n\nC. NH4I + Pb(NO3)2\nNH4I is a strong base, and Pb(NO3)2 is a weak acid. In this reaction, NH4I will completely dissociate into NH4+ and I-. Pb(NO3)2 will also dissociate into Pb^2+ and 2NO3^\u2212. The net ionic equation will be:\nNH4+ + I- + Pb^2+ + 2NO3^\u2212 -> NH4NO3 + PbI2\n\nD. KOH + HClO4\nKOH is a strong base, and HClO4 is a strong acid. In this reaction, KOH will completely dissociate into K+ and OH-. HClO4 will also completely dissociate into ClO4^\u2212 and H+. The net ionic equation will be:\nK+ + OH- + ClO4^\u2212 + H+ -> KClO4 + H2O\n\nNone of the pairs will have a net ionic equation where all the ions cancel.",
