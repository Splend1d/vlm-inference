The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

            "content": "The question is asking us to compare the practices in the excerpt from Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala's \"The First New Chronicle and Good Government\" with the English treatment of the natives in the New World. The excerpt describes the harsh treatment of the poor Indians in the quicksilver mines of Huancavelica, where they are punished, tortured, and die. It also mentions the lack of payment for their labor, the use of Indian women as concubines, and the withholding of food and drink from them.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Viewed the natives as true equals as they settled the Americas - This option is not mentioned in the excerpt. The excerpt does not provide any information about how the English viewed the natives.\n\nB. Were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership - This option is not mentioned in the excerpt. The excerpt does not provide any information about the English being confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership.\n\nC. Used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton - This option is not mentioned in the excerpt. The excerpt does not provide any information about the English using the natives for harvesting cash crops.\n\nD. Used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton - This option is not mentioned in the excerpt. The excerpt does not provide any information about the English using the natives for harvesting cash crops.\n\nSo, none of the options match the information provided in the excerpt. However, if we have to choose one, option A might be the closest, as it suggests that the English viewed the natives as true equals, which is not mentioned in the excerpt. But it's important to note that this is not a direct comparison, as the excerpt does not provide any information about how the English viewed the natives.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A}}$.",
