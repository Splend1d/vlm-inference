The primary (input) coil of a step-up transformer is connected to the lower voltage source, while the secondary (output) coil is connected to the higher voltage load. The magnetic flux produced in the primary coil is proportional to the applied voltage, and this flux induces a voltage in the secondary coil. As a result, the secondary coil receives a higher voltage than the primary coil, effectively stepping up the voltage. The energy in the circuit remains the same, as the energy is conserved in the transformer.",
