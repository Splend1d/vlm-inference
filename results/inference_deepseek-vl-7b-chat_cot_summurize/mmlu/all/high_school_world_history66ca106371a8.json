            "content": "The poet, Dennis Brutus, is referring to the world's silent or subtle support for apartheid in South Africa. He is not saying that the world is too afraid to oppose apartheid, nor is he saying that the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. He is also not saying that the world condemns South Africa's discrimination or that the world economy promotes it. Instead, he is suggesting that the world is complicit in apartheid because it does not openly oppose it. This is a subtle form of support, as it does not take direct action against apartheid, but it does not speak out against it either. Therefore, the poet means that \"what the world whispers\" refers to the world's silent or subtle support for apartheid.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.",
