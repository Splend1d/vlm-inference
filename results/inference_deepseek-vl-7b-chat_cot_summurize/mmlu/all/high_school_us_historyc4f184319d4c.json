Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.\u2026 It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n\u2014Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775\nIn this passage, Henry expresses an abiding American concern about which of the following?\n\nA. No entangling alliances with foreign countries\nB. The dangers of standing armies\nC. Self-government\nD. The separation of church and state\n",

He is emphasizing the importance of self-government and the dangers of standing armies, which were used by the British to maintain control over the colonies. He also mentions the potential for entangling alliances with foreign countries and the separation of church and state, but these are not the main focus of his speech. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The dangers of standing armies.",
