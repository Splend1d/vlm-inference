This is because the lesion transilluminates well, suggesting that it is likely a fluid-filled cyst or a non-neoplastic condition. Needle aspiration allows for the removal of the fluid, which can then be analyzed for further diagnosis.\n\nA sclerosing agent injection (option A) is not appropriate in this case, as it would be used to treat a neoplastic condition, and there is no indication that the swelling is malignant. A needle biopsy (option C) may be considered if the needle aspiration is inconclusive, but it carries a risk of infection and bleeding, and may not provide definitive results. Surgical repair (option D) is not necessary in this case, as the swelling is not associated with any symptoms or complications.",
