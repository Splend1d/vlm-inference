            "content": "The rate law for a reaction can be determined by analyzing the shape of the reaction rate versus time graph. In this case, the chemist has constructed four graphs: [A] versus time, ln[A] versus time, 1/[A] versus time, and [A] versus time.\n\nThe first two graphs, [A] versus time and ln[A] versus time, both show a curved line. This indicates that the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of A, and the rate of the reaction increases as the concentration of A increases.\n\nThe third graph, 1/[A] versus time, shows a straight line. This indicates that the reaction rate is independent of the concentration of A, and the rate of the reaction remains constant regardless of the concentration of A.\n\nGiven these observations, the rate law for the reaction A \u2192 2B can be determined. Since the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of A, and the rate of the reaction increases as the concentration of A increases, the rate law is:\n\nRate = k[A]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Rate = k[A].",
