This can be calculated using the formula for the probability of the complement of an event.\n\nThe probability of a patient not developing side effects is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nSince the events are independent, the probability that all four patients will not develop side effects is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\nP(none of the patients develop side effects) = 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096\n\nSo, the probability that none of the patients will develop side effects is 0.4096, which corresponds to option B.",
