            "content": "The excerpt from Pennsylvania law, 1826, reflects the fact that the framers of the Constitution allowed for a state to be exempt from federal laws that went against that state's constitution. This is because the law in question is a state law that allows for the punishment of those who attempt to take, carry away, or seduce slaves from Pennsylvania to other places. This would be in violation of the federal law, which was the Constitution itself, as it did not allow for slavery. Therefore, the state of Pennsylvania could exempt itself from this federal law by passing its own law that allowed for the punishment of those who violated it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. allowed for a state to be exempt from federal laws that went against that state's constitution.",
