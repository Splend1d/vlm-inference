We can do this using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the percentile for, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the z-score for the 80th percentile:\n\nz = (X - 167) / 76\n\nNow, we'll use a z-table or calculator to find the corresponding value of X. The z-score for the 80th percentile is approximately 1.28.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the value of X corresponding to a z-score of 1.28 is approximately 153.\n\nSo, the middle 80% of durations is approximately between 153 minutes and 167 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest interval is:\n\nB. 53 minutes to 281 minutes",
