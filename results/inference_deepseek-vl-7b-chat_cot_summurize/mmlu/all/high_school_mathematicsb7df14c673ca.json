We are given that R = 0.3 and S = 0.7 (since there is a 40% probability of no rain, there is a 60% probability of sun).\n\nWe want to find the probability of both rain and sun, which is the intersection of the two events. We can use the formula for the probability of the intersection of two events:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B) - P(A) * P(B') - P(B) * P(A') + P(A') * P(B')\n\nwhere A is the event of rain, B is the event of sun, A' is the event of no rain, and B' is the event of no sun.\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 0.3 * 0.7 - 0.3 * 0.6 - 0.7 * 0.3 + 0.7 * 0.6\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 0.21 - 0.18 - 0.21 + 0.42\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 0.24\n\nSo, the probability of both rain and sun is 0.24, which corresponds to option B.",
