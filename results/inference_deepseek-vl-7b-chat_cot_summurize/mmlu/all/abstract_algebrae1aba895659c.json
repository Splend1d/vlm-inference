            "content": "Statement 1: Q is an extension field of Z_2. This statement is true. The field Q, which represents the set of rational numbers, is indeed an extension field of Z_2, the set of integers modulo 2. This is because every element in Q can be represented as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers, and b is not divisible by 2. Therefore, Q is an extension field of Z_2.\n\nStatement 2: Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is also true. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, every non-constant polynomial with coefficients in a field has at least one root in the field. This root can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers, and b is not divisible by the degree of the polynomial (in this case, 2). Therefore, this root is in some extension field of the field of coefficients.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A.",
