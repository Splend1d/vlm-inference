U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) is a security standard that uses a USB dongle to provide an additional layer of security for online accounts. When a user logs in, the U2F dongle generates a one-time code that is used as the second factor of authentication. Even if the computer is turned off, the U2F dongle can still generate codes, which are then used to authenticate the user. This means that malware on the user's computer cannot steal the second factor to impersonate the user.\n\nStatement 2: A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.\n\nThis statement is also true. When a user logs in using a U2F dongle, the server can verify that the login request is coming from the correct computer by checking the public key associated with the U2F dongle. This public key is unique to each U2F dongle and is stored on the server. When the user logs in, the server can verify that the public key matches the one stored on the server, ensuring that the login request is coming from the correct computer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
