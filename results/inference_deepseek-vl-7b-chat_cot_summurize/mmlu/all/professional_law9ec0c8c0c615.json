            "content": "Denise Developer found a near-perfect piece of property zoned commercial in the downtown area of Pleasantville. She hired an architect to design a high tech office building with an objective of attracting upscale tech-industry tenants. She approached Microhard and secured a lease agreement for over half of the available square footage. The lease was not recorded, but the agreement allowed Denise to attract other wealthy tenants. She also disclosed the Microhard lease on her application for a $1,500,000 construction loan from Maximum Mortgage Company. Denise executed a mortgage and related promissory note in favor of Maximum. Maximum recorded the mortgage immediately. The office building was completed and Denise had more tenant demand than available space, so the building opened full. One year later, Denise ran into financial trouble and defaulted on the mortgage. Maximum took possession and immediately notified all the tenants that their leases were cancelled, that they were evicted, and that they must vacate immediately unless they were willing to sign a new lease at double the previous rent. The recording statute in the jurisdiction specified \"every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first.\" The tenants retained you to compel Maximum to honor the leases at the lower rents. Which of the following statements of advice is the most accurate?\n\nA. All the tenants will prevail (unless otherwise in default on their leases), because Maximum loaned money to Denise with actual knowledge that she intended to enter into binding leases with the tenants.\nB. Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease.\nC. Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease.\nD. All the tenants should renegotiate their leases with Maximum.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. All the tenants will prevail (unless otherwise in default on their leases), because Maximum loaned money to Denise with actual knowledge that she intended to enter into binding leases with the tenants.\n\nThe reason for this is that Maximum Mortgage Company had actual knowledge of the leases with the tenants when they recorded the mortgage. According to the recording statute, \"every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first.\" Since Maximum recorded the mortgage first, their action of cancelling the leases and evicting the tenants is void as against any subsequent party, which includes the tenants.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease. This is incorrect because constructive notice does not apply in this case. Constructive notice means that a party knows of a fact that should have been known to them, but it does not mean they had actual knowledge of the lease.\n\nC. Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease. This is incorrect because actual notice does not apply in this case. Actual notice means that a party knows of a fact that is true, but it does not mean they had actual knowledge of the lease.\n\nD. All the tenants should renegotiate their leases with Maximum. This is incorrect because the tenants are not in default on their leases, and they have a valid lease with Maximum. They should not have to renegotiate their leases unless they choose to do so.",
