            "content": "When a sound wave travels from a less dense medium to a denser medium, the speed of the wave (velocity) decreases. This is because the denser medium provides more resistance to the movement of the wave particles, causing them to move more slowly.\n\nThe intensity of the sound wave remains the same, as it is determined by the energy of the wave and not by the density of the medium through which it is traveling.\n\nThe frequency of the sound wave may change when it enters a denser medium. If the density of the medium increases, the speed of the wave particles decreases, which can cause the frequency to decrease. Conversely, if the density of the medium decreases, the frequency may increase.\n\nThe wavelength of the sound wave may change when it enters a denser medium. If the density of the medium increases, the speed of the wave particles decreases, which can cause the wavelength to increase. Conversely, if the density of the medium decreases, the wavelength may decrease.\n\nTherefore, the only change that does not occur when a sound wave enters a denser medium is the change in velocity.",
