            "content": "Statement 1: If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V ) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective.\n\nThis statement is true. A linear transformation is injective (also known as one-to-one) if it maps each element of the domain to a unique element of the codomain. Since the codomain has a higher dimension than the domain, there must be a unique element in the codomain for each element in the domain. Therefore, the transformation is injective.\n\nStatement 2: Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nThis statement is false. A bijection (also known as a bijective or one-to-one and onto) is a function that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). In the context of linear transformations, if T is injective, it means that it is one-to-one, but it does not necessarily mean that it is onto (surjective). For a linear transformation to be a bijection, it must also be surjective.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, True.",
