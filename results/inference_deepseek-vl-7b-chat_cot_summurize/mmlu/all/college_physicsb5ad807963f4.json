            "content": "The period of a pendulum is inversely proportional to the square of its length. This is a result of the conservation of angular momentum. The conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant, provided that no external torques are acting on the system.\n\nFor a simple pendulum, the angular momentum is given by the product of the mass (m) and the distance from the pivot point (r) to the center of mass (L). Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nL = sqrt(m * g * L^2)\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nNow, let's consider the two pendulums. The period of pendulum A is T_A, and the period of pendulum B is T_B. We are given that T_B = 2T_A.\n\nUsing the conservation of angular momentum, we can write:\n\nL_A * T_A = L_B * T_B\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nL_A * T_A = 2 * L_A * T_A\n\nDividing both sides by L_A * T_A, we get:\n\n1 = 2\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that the given information is not consistent with the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, none of the options provided are true.",
