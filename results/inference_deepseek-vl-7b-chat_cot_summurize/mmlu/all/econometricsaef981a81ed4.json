This is not the same as the power of the test, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. \n\nThe size of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, it is 1 - alpha, which is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor a 2-sided test, the total distribution is split into four equal parts. Each tail rejection region will have 2.5% of the total distribution, not 5%. So, statement (iii) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. (i) and (iv) only.",
