Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are designed to find a set of hyperplanes that best separate the data, but they do not guarantee that they will find the globally optimal hyperplane. The global optimal hyperplane may not exist, or it may be non-unique.\n\nStatement 2: After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space. This statement is true. The kernel trick is a powerful technique in SVMs and other machine learning algorithms that allows them to work with non-linearly separable data. By mapping the data into a higher-dimensional space, the Perceptron (or other algorithms) can potentially find a hyperplane that separates the classes more effectively.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.
