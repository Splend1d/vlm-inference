For n >= 3, the group S_n is non-Abelian. This is because the group operation is not commutative, meaning that the order in which the permutations are applied matters.\n\nStatement 2: If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n).\n\nThis statement is false. The absolute value of the product of two permutations, |ab|, is not necessarily equal to the least common multiple (lcm) of the lengths of the permutations, m and n. The absolute value of a permutation is the length of the permutation, and the lcm of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. The absolute value of a permutation and the lcm of its length and another number are not necessarily equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
