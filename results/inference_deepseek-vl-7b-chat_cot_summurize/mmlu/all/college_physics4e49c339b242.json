The paradox arises because the mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, but the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A.\n\nThe net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Therefore, if the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A, and the mass of object B is twice that of object A, then the net force acting on object B should be four times that of object A.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the net force acting on object B is F_B, and the net force acting on object A is F_A. Therefore, F_B = 2F_A.",
