If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nAccording to the passage, what was the Chinese reaction to the British goods?\n\nA. Awe at their technological superiority\nB. Fascination with their strangeness\nC. Offense at a perceived bribe\nD. Interpreting them as an act of submission\n",

Instead, the Chinese emperor stated that he set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and had no use for the British country's manufactures. This indicates that the Chinese did not find the British goods appealing or useful, and therefore, their reaction was not influenced by any of the given options.",
