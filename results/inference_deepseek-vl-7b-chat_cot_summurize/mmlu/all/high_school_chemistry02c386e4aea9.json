            "content": "To find the molecular mass of a gas, we need to know the molar mass of the gas. The molar mass is the mass of one mole of the gas. We can use the ideal gas law, which is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the pressure (P) and temperature (T) as 722 torr and 26.0 \u00b0C, respectively. We need to convert the temperature to Kelvin using the following formula:\n\nT (K) = (T (\u00b0C) + 273.15)\n\nT (K) = (26.0 + 273.15) = 299.15 K\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the volume (V) of the gas:\n\n722 torr = n * R * T\n\nV = (722 torr) / (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K) * (299.15 K)\n\nV = 0.849 L\n\nNow that we have the volume, we can find the number of moles (n) using the density (\u03c1) and volume (V):\n\nn = \u03c1 * V\n\nn = 2.05 g/L * 0.849 L\n\nn = 1.74 g/mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can find the molecular mass (M) using the formula:\n\nM = n * M_mol\n\nM = 1.74 g/mol * 46.7 g/mol\n\nM = 80.06 g/mol\n\nThe molecular mass of the gas is approximately 80.06 g/mol, which is closest to option B.",
