            "content": "The prevalence of a disease is defined as the number of cases of the disease in a population divided by the total population. In this case, we are given the number of cases and deaths from the disease, as well as the total number of deaths from all causes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of deaths from the disease in the population:\n\nNumber of deaths from the disease = Number of cases - Number of deaths from all causes\nNumber of deaths from the disease = 250,000 - 2,500 = 247,500\n\nNow, we can calculate the prevalence of the disease:\n\nPrevalence of the disease = (Number of deaths from the disease / Total population) * 100\nPrevalence of the disease = (247,500 / 250,000) * 100\nPrevalence of the disease = 0.99 * 100\nPrevalence of the disease = 99\n\nSo, the prevalence of the disease is 99 per 100,000 people. This is closest to option C, which is 1,000/250,000. However, since the question asks for a whole number, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number, which is 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
