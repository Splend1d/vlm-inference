            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible sequences of dots and dashes for each number of symbols (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n\nFor 1 symbol:\n- There can be 0 or 1 dot or dash.\n- So, there are 2 possibilities: 0 dots and 1 dot, or 1 dot and 0 dots.\n\nFor 2 symbols:\n- There can be 0, 1, or 2 dots or dashes.\n- So, there are 3 possibilities: 0 dots and 2 dashes, 1 dot and 1 dash, or 2 dots and 0 dashes.\n\nFor 3 symbols:\n- There can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 dots or dashes.\n- So, there are 4 possibilities: 0 dots and 3 dashes, 1 dot and 2 dashes, 2 dots and 1 dash, or 3 dots and 0 dashes.\n\nFor 4 symbols:\n- There can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 dots or dashes.\n- So, there are 5 possibilities: 0 dots and 4 dashes, 1 dot and 3 dashes, 2 dots and 2 dashes, 3 dots and 1 dash, or 4 dots and 0 dashes.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of distinct symbols by multiplying the number of possibilities for each number of symbols:\n\nTotal symbols = 2 (1 symbol) * 3 (2 symbols) * 4 (3 symbols) * 5 (4 symbols) = 240\n\nHowever, this includes the case of 0 dots and 0 dashes, which is not a distinct symbol. So, we need to subtract 1 from the total:\n\nTotal distinct symbols = 240 - 1 = 239\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
