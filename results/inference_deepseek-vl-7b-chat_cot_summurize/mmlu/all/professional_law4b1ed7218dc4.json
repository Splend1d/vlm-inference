This means that the homeowner agreed to pay the quarterly premiums as part of the contract with the insurance company, and in return, the insurance company agreed to pay up to $500,000 if the house was destroyed by fire or fire-related explosion. The homeowner's failure to make the last two premium payments does not negate the existence of this bargained-for exchange, as the insurance company's promise to pay for the loss was not expressly conditioned on the homeowner's duty to make the payments. The insurance company's duty to pay was not independent of the homeowner's duty to make the payments, and the homeowner did not receive notice of cancellation.",
