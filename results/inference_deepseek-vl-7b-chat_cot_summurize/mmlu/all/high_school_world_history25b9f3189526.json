Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\nInstructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512\nThe two letters best support which of the following conclusions?\n\nA. Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial.\nB. Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.\nC.

            "content": "The two letters provided give us a glimpse into the relationship between Portugal and Kongo during the period of exploration and trade. \n\nIn Source 1, King Afonso I of Kongo expresses his concern about the kidnapping of his people by the Portuguese, who are in search of slaves and other goods to take back to Portugal. This indicates that the trade between the two countries was not just brisk, but also involved the kidnapping of Kongolese people, which was a source of great inconvenience and distress for the Kongo people.\n\nIn Source 2, King Manuel of Portugal instructs his envoy in Kongo to make the Kongolese understand that they should provide the Portuguese with slaves, copper, or ivory to fill the ships. This suggests that the trade between the two countries was highly regulated, with the Kongolese being pressured to provide goods to the Portuguese.\n\nTherefore, the two letters best support the conclusion that trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties, and that the trade was highly regulated with the Kongolese being pressured to provide goods to the Portuguese.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
