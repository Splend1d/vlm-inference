Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet.\n\nCareful consideration should be given to providing people aged over 65 with information sources that are internet-based because they may have difficulty reading the screen due to vision problems, which can be common in older individuals. Additionally, while it's true that less than 30% of people over 65 have access to the internet, it's important to provide these resources to ensure they are not left behind in the digital age. Providing information in other formats, such as print or audio, can be helpful for those who have difficulty using the internet.",
