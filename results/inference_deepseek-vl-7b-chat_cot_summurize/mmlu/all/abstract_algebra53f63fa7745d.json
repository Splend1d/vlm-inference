            "content": "Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha. This statement is true. In group theory, the left cosets of a subgroup H in a group G are defined as aH = {ah | h in H}. This is indeed equal to Ha = {ha | h in H}, as the operation in a group is associative. Therefore, aH = Ha.\n\nStatement 2: If H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H. This statement is also true. If H is a normal subgroup of a group G, then for any a in G and h in H, we have ah = ha. This is because the left coset aH = Ha, and the left coset aH is generated by the left coset ha. Therefore, ah = ha for all h in H.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A. True, True.",
