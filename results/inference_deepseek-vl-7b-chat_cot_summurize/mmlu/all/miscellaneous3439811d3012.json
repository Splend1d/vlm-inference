Let's assume the average attendance is 60,000 people per game.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ticket sales revenue for one game:\n\nTicket sales revenue = Average price per ticket * Average attendance per game\nTicket sales revenue = $20 * 60,000 = $1,200,000\n\nSince there are 150 games, we can calculate the total ticket sales revenue for the 150 games:\n\nTotal ticket sales revenue = Ticket sales revenue per game * Number of games\nTotal ticket sales revenue = $1,200,000 * 150 = $1,800,000,000\n\nSo, the closest answer to the estimated ticket sales revenue for the 150 games combined is option D: $20,000,000,000.",
