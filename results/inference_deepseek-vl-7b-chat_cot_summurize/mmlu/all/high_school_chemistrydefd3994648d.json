Sodium is in the same group (1) and period (2) as magnesium in the periodic table.\n2. The ionization energy of magnesium is 737 kJ/mol.\n3. The atomic radius of magnesium is 160 pm.\n\nFrom these pieces of information, we can make the following observations:\n\n1. The ionization energy of magnesium is 737 kJ/mol. Since sodium is in the same group and period, we can expect its ionization energy to be lower.\n2. The atomic radius of magnesium is 160 pm. Since sodium is in the same group and period, we can expect its atomic radius to be smaller.\n\nBased on these observations, the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium are:\n\nIonization energy: 496 kJ/mol (lower than magnesium's ionization energy)\nAtomic radius: 135 pm (smaller than magnesium's atomic radius)\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol.",
