As she swung across the center line into the southbound lane, her vehicle collided with a fire engine.

            "content": "The question presents a scenario where a businesswoman, in a hurry to reach her business appointment, decides to pass the car in front of her by swinging across the center line of a two-way highway. This action results in a collision with a fire engine, which is delayed in reaching a nearby house that is completely destroyed by fire. The owner of the house is now considering suing the businesswoman for the damages caused by the fire.\n\nThe question asks which of the given options the owner is most likely to recover from the businesswoman.\n\nA. Recover the fair market value of his house before the fire.\nThis option is not likely to be recovered by the owner because the businesswoman's action did not directly cause the fire. The fire could have been caused by other factors, such as a malfunction in the house's electrical system or a natural disaster.\n\nB. Recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\nThis option is also not likely to be recovered by the owner. The businesswoman's action did not directly cause the fire, and it is unclear how much of the owner's loss would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\n\nC. Recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire.\nThis option is likely to be the correct answer. The businesswoman's action did not directly cause the fire, and it is unclear how the owner's loss is related to the businesswoman's actions. The businesswoman was driving in the wrong lane, but this does not necessarily mean she is responsible for the fire.\n\nD. Recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.\nThis option is not likely to be recovered by the owner. The traffic statute does not seem to be relevant to the owner's claim against the businesswoman. The businesswoman's action was a violation of the statute, but this does not necessarily mean she is responsible for the fire.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is option C. The owner is most likely to recover nothing from the businesswoman because the businesswoman's actions did not directly cause the fire, and it is unclear how the owner's loss is related to the businesswoman's actions.",
