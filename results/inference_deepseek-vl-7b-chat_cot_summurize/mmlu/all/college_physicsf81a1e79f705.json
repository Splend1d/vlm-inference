            "content": "The kinetic energy of a body is proportional to the square of its speed. Since the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball is 10%, the uncertainty in its kinetic energy will be 10% squared, which is approximately 1%. Therefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is 1%, which is not listed in the given options. However, the closest answer would be option B, which is 10%.",
