If the weather is dry that day, there is a 0.2% chance of an accident on Highway 48; if the weather is wet that day, there is a 1.0% chance of an accident. Today, the weather station announced that there is a 20% chance of the weather being wet. What is the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today?\n\nA. 0.0004\nB. 0.0016\nC. 0.002\nD. 0.0036\n",

Therefore, the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today is 0.0004.",
