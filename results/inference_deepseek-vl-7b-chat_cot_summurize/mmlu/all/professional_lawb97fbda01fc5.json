The trial court instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he had acted in self-defense. The defendant objected, arguing that this instruction violated the constitutional requirement that the prosecution prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Did the trial court's instruction violate the defendant's federal constitutional rights?\n\nA. No, because due process does not preclude requiring a defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, because due process does not regulate the burdens of proof in criminal cases.\nC. Yes, because due process precludes placing any evidentiary burden on a criminal defendant.\nD. Yes, because due process precludes requiring a criminal defendant to bear the burden on an issue that would make an act lawful.\n",
