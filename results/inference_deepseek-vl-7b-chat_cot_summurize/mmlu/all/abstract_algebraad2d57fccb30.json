If H is a normal subgroup of G, then the set HK is a subgroup of G. This is because the operation of HK is associative, and for any h1 in H, h2 in K, and h3 in H, we have (h1h2)h3 = h1(h2h3) = h1h2h3, which is in HK.\n\nStatement 2: All groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian.\n\nThis statement is false. While it is true that many groups of order p^2 are Abelian, it is not true for all of them. For example, the dihedral group D_4 of order 8, which is the group of symmetries of a square, is a group of order 8 and is not Abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
