They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nThe two political issues that most concerned the Counterculture Movement of the 1960s were\n\nA.

            "content": "The Counterculture Movement of the 1960s was a cultural and political phenomenon that emerged in response to the Vietnam War and the broader social and political issues of the time. The movement was characterized by a rejection of traditional values, a focus on individualism, and a desire for social and political change.\n\nThe two political issues that were most concerning to the Counterculture Movement of the 1960s were:\n\nA. U.S. involvement in Vietnam and flag burning: This issue was deeply ingrained in the movement's ethos, as many members of the movement were opposed to the U.S. involvement in Vietnam and saw it as a symbol of imperialism and oppression. Flag burning was a common act of protest during this time, as it was seen as a way to express opposition to the war and the country's involvement in it.\n\nB. the civil rights movement and censorship: While the civil rights movement was not a direct part of the Counterculture Movement, it was deeply intertwined with the broader social and political issues of the time. The movement was a key part of the broader push for social and political change in the 1960s, and many members of the Counterculture Movement were involved in or supportive of the civil rights movement. Censorship was also a major issue for the movement, as many members felt that the government and media were suppressing their voices and ideas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the civil rights movement.",
