            "content": "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to its velocity. This is known as Newton's second law of motion. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n\na = (F/m)\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, F is the force acting on the object, and m is the mass of the object.\n\nIn this case, the toy truck's mass is double the toy car's mass. Therefore, the acceleration of the truck will be half that of the car.\n\nNow, let's consider the forces acting on the toy car and the toy truck during the collision. The force of collision is equal and opposite to the force of friction between the two toys. Since the toy truck has a larger mass, it will experience a larger force of friction.\n\nThe acceleration of the car will be in the same direction as the force of friction, which is opposite to the direction of the force of collision. Therefore, the acceleration of the car will be double the magnitude of the acceleration of the truck, but in the opposite direction.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. double the magnitude and in the opposite direction.",
