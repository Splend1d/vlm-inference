Some mutations produce alleles that are recessive and may not be expressed.\nB. Some undesirable phenotypic traits may be prevented from reproducing.\nC. Some mutations cause such drastic phenotypic changes that they are removed from the gene pool.\nD. The predictable rate of mutation results in ongoing variability in a gene pool.\n",
