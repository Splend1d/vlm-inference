Compared with the larger stock population of mainland finches, these separate populations exhibit far greater variation over a wider range of species. The variation among these numerous finch species is the result of\n\nA. convergent evolution\nB. divergent evolution\nC. disruptive selection\nD. stabilizing selection\n",
