The woman conveyed the land to a friend \"for life,\" and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor \"and her heirs.\" The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?\n\nA. The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.\nB. The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.\nC. The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.\nD. The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n",
