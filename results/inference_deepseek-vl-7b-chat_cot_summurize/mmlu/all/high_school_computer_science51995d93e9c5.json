The % operator is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second operand. So, 3 % 2 is equal to 1. Therefore, the expression 4 + 3 % 2 is equivalent to 4 + 1, which equals 5. However, the question asks for the value of the expression, not its result. The value of the expression is 4 + (3 % 2), which is 4 + 1, or 5.",
