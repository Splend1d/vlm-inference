In L2 regularization, the penalty term is the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, which encourages smaller coefficients and thus a more sparse model. In contrast, L1 regularization, also known as Lasso, adds a penalty term to the magnitude of the coefficients, which encourages zero coefficients and thus a more sparse model.\n\nStatement 2: False, False\n\nResidual connections are not found in ResNets and Transformers. Residual connections are a key component of ResNets, a type of deep neural network architecture that helps to mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients. However, they are not used in Transformers, which are another type of deep neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of input tokens.",
