Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people\u2014these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism.

The New Left was a political and social movement in the United States that emerged in the 1960s. It was a reaction against the perceived failures of the New Deal and the Great Society programs of the Democratic Party, as well as the Vietnam War. The New Left was characterized by its opposition to capitalism, imperialism, and racism, and its support for social justice and equality. The Port Huron Statement, which was written by a group of young radicals in 1962, is considered to be a key document of the New Left movement.",
