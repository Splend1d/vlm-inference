No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\n",
