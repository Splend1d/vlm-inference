            "content": "Statement 1: The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers.\n\nThis statement is false. The back-propagation algorithm is a gradient descent method used to train neural networks, but it does not guarantee that the network will be globally optimal. In fact, it is known that back-propagation can get stuck in local minima, and it may not converge to the global minimum even for simple networks.\n\nStatement 2: The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line.\n\nThis statement is true. The VC (Vapnik\u2013Chervonenkis) dimension is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm, and it is defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter. In this case, you are correct that you can find a set of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line, which means the VC dimension of a line is at most 2.",
