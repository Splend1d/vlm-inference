            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\nWe are given that the final velocity (v) is 130 km/h, which is equal to 130 * 10000 m/h = 130000 m/h. We are also given that the distance of the track (d) is 50 m.\n\nWe need to find the acceleration (a) to reach this velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the final velocity from km/h to m/s:\n\n130000 m/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 361.11 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\n361.11 m/s = u + a * 50 s\n\nWe can solve for the initial velocity (u):\n\nu = 361.11 m/s - a * 50 s\n\nNow, we can plug the values of u and v into the formula again:\n\n361.11 m/s = (361.11 m/s - a * 50 s) + a * 50 s\n\nSolving for a:\n\na = (361.11 m/s) / (50 s) - 361.11 m/s / (50 s)\na = 7.22 m/s^2\n\nSo, the car must accelerate at a rate of 7.22 m/s^2 to reach a velocity of 130 km/h.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 26 m/s^2.",
