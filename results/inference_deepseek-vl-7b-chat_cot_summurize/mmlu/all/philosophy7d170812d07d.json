According to Mill, justice is a positive duty, which means that it is a duty that one has towards others, and it requires one to act in a way that benefits others. On the other hand, other moral obligations, such as beneficence and non-maleficence, are negative duties, which means that they are duties that one has towards oneself, and they require one to avoid actions that harm oneself or others.",
