            "content": "Police officers received an anonymous tip that two men were selling cocaine from the back of a restaurant. The tipster stated to the police that the two men were both tall white men who were wearing jeans and black shirts, the uniform of the restaurant. The tipster also said that one of the men had red hair and was wearing a tan ball cap and the other man had black hair and was wearing a red ball cap. The police set up surveillance on the back of the restaurant and saw the two men make several hand- to-hand transactions. Upon receiving authority to make the arrest from their commanding officer, they waited for the two men to come out again. About two hours later, the two men came out again, this time with a woman. The officers arrested the two men and detained the woman to determine her involvement. The officers took the woman's purse without her consent and searched it for illegal narcotics. In her purse they found three grams of crack cocaine, digital scales, a small glass pipe used for inhaling crack cocaine, and a balloon of black tar heroin. The woman was then arrested on the various drug charges. The woman was thereafter prosecuted and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. She filed a motion to exclude the drugs and the paraphernalia from evidence. Her motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of her purse.\nB. granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before conducting the search.\nC. denied, because the search was justified, since she was about to leave the scene of the crime.\nD. denied, because she was sufficiently close or proximate to the crime scene to justifi the warrantless search.\n",
