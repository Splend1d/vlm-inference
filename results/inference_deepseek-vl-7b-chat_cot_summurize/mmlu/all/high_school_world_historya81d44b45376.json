It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following is a treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.?\n\nA. Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\nB. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\nD. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n",

Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\nThis option is not accurate because the text does not mention any conversion of barbarian peoples to the religions of their host societies.\n\nB. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\nThis option is not accurate because the text does not mention any utilization of barbarian peoples as soldiers in their host societies.\n\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\nThis option is not accurate because the text does not mention any uniform relegation of barbarian peoples to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\n\nD. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\nThis option is not accurate because the text does not mention any invitation of barbarian peoples to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n\nTherefore, none of the options accurately describe a treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600-1450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.\n\nSo, the answer is None of the above.",
