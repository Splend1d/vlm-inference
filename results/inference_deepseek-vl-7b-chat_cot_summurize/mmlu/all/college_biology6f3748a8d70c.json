However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)\n\nA. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\nB. Both fox and hare populations will increase.\nC. Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.\nD. Fox populations will increase and hare populations will decrease.\n",
