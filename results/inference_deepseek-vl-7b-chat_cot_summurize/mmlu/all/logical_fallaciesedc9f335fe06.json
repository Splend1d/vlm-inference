The minor premise then either affirms the antecedent (i.e., supports the condition that leads to the conclusion) or denies the consequent (i.e., contradicts the conclusion that follows from the condition). \n\nThis structure is different from a categorical argument, where the major premise states a general principle (i.e., a categorical statement) and the minor premise either affirms or denies an instance of that general principle. \n\nA Toulmin argument is a specific type of argument that includes a claim, reasons, and backing, but the statement you provided is not specific to Toulmin's framework. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Conditional (or hypothetical).",
