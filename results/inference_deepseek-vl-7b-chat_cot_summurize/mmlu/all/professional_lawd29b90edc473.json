One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\nB. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.\nC. The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.\nD. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n",

The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n\nThe two men agreed to commit a crime (burglary) and planned to do so. This constitutes a conspiracy. The alarm specialist provided the means for the men to commit the crime (disarming the alarm system), which also constitutes a conspiracy. However, they did not actually commit the crime (burglary) because they abandoned their plan due to the presence of the guard dog. This means they attempted to commit the crime but did not succeed. Therefore, they are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.",
