A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\nA. The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\nB. A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\nC. The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\nD. Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.\n",
