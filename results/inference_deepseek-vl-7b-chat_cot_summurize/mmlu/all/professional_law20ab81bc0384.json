This income tax exempts taxable income earned by city residents outside of the state. Moreover, residents of the city were not taxed on their in-city earned income. A commuter who works in the city but is a resident of a neighboring state, challenges the constitutionality of this statute. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIV.\nD. The commerce clause.\n",
