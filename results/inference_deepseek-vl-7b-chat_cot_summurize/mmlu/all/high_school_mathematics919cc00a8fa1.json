            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The ladder forms a right triangle with the building and the ground. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the ladder itself (26 feet), and the other two sides are the distance from the building (10 feet) and the distance the foot of the ladder moves away from the building per second (3 feet).\n\nLet's denote the time it takes for the foot of the ladder to be 10 feet away from the building as t seconds. Then, the distance the foot moves away from the building in that time is 3t feet.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n(10)^2 + (3t)^2 = 26^2\n100 + 9t^2 = 724\n\nNow, we need to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down, which is r feet per second. We can do this by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd/dt (100 + 9t^2) = d/dt (724)\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n2 * 9t = 724\n18t = 724\nt = 724 / 18\nt = 40.22 seconds\n\nNow, we can find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down:\n\nr = (3t) / t\nr = 3\n\nSo, the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down is 3 feet per second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",
