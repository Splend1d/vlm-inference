The direct labor standards indicated that each unit of finished goods requires 2.4 direct labor hours at a standard wage of $20 per hour, totaling $48.00 per finished good unit. During March, the company actually made 9,000 units of finished goods. Production used 2.5 labor hours per finished unit, and the company actually paid $21 per hour, totaling $52.50 per unit of finished product. What amount is the company's direct labor rate variance for March?\n\nA. $18,000\nB. $22,500\nC. $25,000\nD. $40,500\n",

            "content": "The direct labor rate variance is the difference between the standard labor cost and the actual labor cost. The standard labor cost is the direct labor hours multiplied by the standard wage, which is 2.4 hours * $20/hour = $48/unit. The actual labor cost is the direct labor hours multiplied by the actual wage, which is 2.5 hours * $21/hour = $52.50/unit.\n\nThe direct labor rate variance is the difference between these two costs: ($48/unit - $52.50/unit) * number of units.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nDirect labor rate variance = ($48 - $52.50) * 9000 units = -$4.50 * 9000 units = -$40,500\n\nThe company's direct labor rate variance for March is -$40,500, which is option D.",
