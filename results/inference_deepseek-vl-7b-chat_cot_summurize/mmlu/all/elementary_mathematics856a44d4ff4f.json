This can be written as 4/9 = x/72.\n\nTo find x, we can cross multiply:\n\n4 * 72 = 9 * x\n\n32 = 9x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 32 / 9\n\nx \u2248 3.55\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a student, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, approximately 4 students take tap lessons.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 63.",
