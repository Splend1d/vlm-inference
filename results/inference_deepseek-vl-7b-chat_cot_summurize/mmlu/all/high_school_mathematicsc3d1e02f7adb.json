According to this theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 4, 7: The sum of these two sides is 11, which is greater than 10. So, this could be a valid triangle.\n\nB. 5, 5: The sum of these two sides is 10, which is equal to the length of the longest side. According to the triangle inequality theorem, this would not form a valid triangle.\n\nC. 3, 9: The sum of these two sides is 12, which is greater than 10. So, this could be a valid triangle.\n\nD. 9, 8: The sum of these two sides is 17, which is greater than 10. So, this could be a valid triangle.\n\nTherefore, the length that could NOT be the lengths of the other two sides of a triangle is 5, 5.",
