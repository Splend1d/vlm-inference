Since the hypotenuse is 10 inches, each leg is $\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2}$ inches long. The area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}$ times the product of the lengths of its base and height. In this case, the base and height are both 5$\\sqrt{2}$ inches, so the area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 5\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 25 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{25}$ square inches.\nThe answer is: 25",
