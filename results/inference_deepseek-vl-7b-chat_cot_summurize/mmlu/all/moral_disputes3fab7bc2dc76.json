This principle is derived from Singer's argument that the moral status of animals should be based on their capacity to suffer, and that the least suffering should be the primary consideration in determining their treatment. Therefore, the principle of minimizing suffering is the one that flows from the conclusions argued for in \"all animals are equal\".\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. the principle of minimizing suffering.",
