This agreement was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which aimed to divide Eastern Europe between the two powers. The pact included provisions similar to those in the text, such as mutual non-aggression, non-support for each other in case of third-party aggression, and consultation and exchange of information on common interests. The other options (Triple Entente, Sykes-Picot Agreement, and Munich Agreement) are not similar to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.",
