If a homomorphism is trivial (i.e., it maps the identity element to the identity element), then its kernel (the set of elements mapped to the identity) is the trivial group, which is the empty set.\n\nStatement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\nThis statement is false. It is indeed possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of a finite group into an infinite group. For example, consider the group of integers modulo 5, denoted as Z_5. The group Z_5 is finite, but it is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism into the infinite group of integers, denoted as Z. The kernel of this homomorphism would be the trivial subgroup generated by 0, which is indeed the empty set.",
