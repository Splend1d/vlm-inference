If they do not have a common multiple, they cannot form a proportion.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\nA. 46 over 108: The least common multiple (LCM) of 46 and 108 is 1386. So, 46 over 108 can form a proportion with 8 over 18.\n\nB. 12 over 27: The LCM of 12 and 27 is 378. So, 12 over 27 can form a proportion with 8 over 18.\n\nC. 60 over 135: The LCM of 60 and 135 is 1350. So, 60 over 135 can form a proportion with 8 over 18.\n\nD. 4 over 9: The LCM of 4 and 9 is 36. So, 4 over 9 cannot form a proportion with 8 over 18.\n\nTherefore, the ratio that cannot form a proportion with 8 over 18 is 4 over 9.",
