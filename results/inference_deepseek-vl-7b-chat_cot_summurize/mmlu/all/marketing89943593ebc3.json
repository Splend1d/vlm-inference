Question marks: These are SBUs that have high growth potential but are currently underperforming. They require significant investments to improve their performance and become more competitive.\n\nB. Quick winners: These are SBUs that are already performing well and have the potential for further growth. They require moderate investments to maintain their performance and continue to grow.\n\nC. Charging bulls: These are SBUs that are performing well and have a strong competitive position. They require minimal investments to maintain their performance and continue to grow.\n\nD. Cash outs: These are SBUs that are underperforming and have limited growth potential. They may require divestiture or restructuring to improve their performance.\n\nOverall, the Boston Consulting Group's portfolio performance framework helps organizations evaluate the performance of their SBUs and make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and investments to achieve their strategic goals.",
