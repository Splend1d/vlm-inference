            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of work done by the brakes. When the elevator falls, the kinetic energy of the elevator increases. When the emergency brakes stop the elevator, they dissipate some of this energy as heat. The work done by the brakes is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the elevator.\n\nLet's denote the initial kinetic energy of the elevator as K1, the final kinetic energy as K2, and the distance the elevator falls as d. The work done by the brakes can be calculated as:\n\nW = K2 - K1\n\nSince the elevator starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy is 0. Therefore, K1 = 0. The final kinetic energy of the elevator is the initial kinetic energy plus the work done by the brakes:\n\nK2 = K1 + W\n\nNow, we can use the formula for kinetic energy:\n\nK = 1/2mv^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the elevator, v is its final velocity, and 1/2 is the kinetic energy coefficient. Since the elevator starts from rest, its final velocity is 0. Therefore, the final kinetic energy is:\n\nK2 = 1/2(1000 kg)(0 m/s)^2 = 0 J\n\nNow we can calculate the work done by the brakes:\n\nW = K2 - K1 = 0 J - 0 J = 0 J\n\nSince the work done by the brakes is 0, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is also 0. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 100 J",
