            "content": "The 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture of DMSO and AN will show a doublet for each compound. The doublet for DMSO will have a splitting pattern of 1H, and the doublet for AN will have a splitting pattern of 3H.\n\nIn the case of DMSO, the doublet will have a splitting pattern of 1H, which means that the two peaks in the spectrum will be very close together. This is because the chemical shift of the proton in DMSO is 0.00 ppm, which is very close to the chemical shift of the proton in water, which is 0.00 ppm.\n\nIn the case of AN, the doublet will have a splitting pattern of 3H, which means that the two peaks in the spectrum will be very close together. This is because the chemical shift of the proton in AN is 0.00 ppm, which is very close to the chemical shift of the proton in water, which is 0.00 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the two concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN], will be equal to the ratio of the two doublet peaks in the spectrum. Since the two doublet peaks are very close together, the ratio will be 1:1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 1:1.",
