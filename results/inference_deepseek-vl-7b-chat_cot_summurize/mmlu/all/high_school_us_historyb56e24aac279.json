It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAll of the following were part of Johnson's Great Society program EXCEPT\n\nA. the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nB.

            "content": "The Great Society program, as described by Lyndon Johnson, was a comprehensive set of policies and programs aimed at addressing various social and economic issues in the United States. It was designed to provide a better quality of life for all Americans, with a focus on education, healthcare, and civil rights.\n\nA. the Civil Rights Act of 1964: This was indeed a part of Johnson's Great Society program. The Civil Rights Act was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to end racial discrimination in the United States. It prohibited racial segregation in public places and mandated the desegregation of schools.\n\nB. Medicare and Medicaid: These were also part of Johnson's Great Society program. Medicare was a social insurance program that provided health insurance for people aged 65 and older, while Medicaid was a health insurance program for low-income individuals.\n\nC. the establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development: This was also part of Johnson's Great Society program. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was established to address housing and urban development issues, including the provision of affordable housing and the improvement of living conditions in urban areas.\n\nD. the balanced budget mandate: This was not part of Johnson's Great Society program. While the Great Society program aimed to provide social and economic benefits to all Americans, it did not mandate a balanced budget. In fact, Johnson's presidency was marked by significant budget deficits, which were a result of the large-scale social programs he implemented.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. the balanced budget mandate.",
