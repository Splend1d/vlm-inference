It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax\n\nA. constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.\nB. constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.\n",
