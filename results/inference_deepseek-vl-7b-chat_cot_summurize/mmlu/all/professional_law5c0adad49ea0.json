The professor made a conveyance thereof in these words, \"I hereby convey my 30-acre tract to both my friend and my co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. \"Two years after making the conveyance to the friend and the co-worker, the friend executed a mortgage on the 30-acre tract of land to a bank to secure a loan. One year after executing the mortgage, the friend died intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. At the time of the friend's death, the indebtedness had not been paid to the bank. The jurisdiction in which the 30-acre tract of land is located recognizes a title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to the 30-acre tract of land is vested\n\nA. in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\nB. in the co-worker, free and clear of the mortgage.\nC. half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, with both subject to the mortgage.\nD. half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n",

            "content": "The professor conveyed the 30-acre tract of land to both his friend and co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. This means that the land was owned equally by both the friend and the co-worker, and if one of them died, their share would pass to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nOne year after the friend's death, the friend's uncle, who was the only heir, took possession of the land. Since the friend's share of the land passed to the uncle upon his death, the uncle now owns half of the land.\n\nThe friend's share of the land, which was subject to the mortgage, also passed to the uncle upon his death. Therefore, the uncle now owns the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\n\nUnder the title theory of mortgages, the mortgage is a lien on the land, but it does not affect the ownership of the land itself. The uncle, as the owner of the land, is still subject to the mortgage, but he can still use and enjoy the land.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. in the co-worker, free and clear of the mortgage.",
