            "content": "The Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that the Moon was formed as a result of a massive collision between the Earth and a Mars-sized body (called Theia) about 4.5 billion years ago. This hypothesis is supported by various pieces of evidence, including:\n\nA. The relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth is large compared to most planets and their moons. This is because the impact that formed the Moon was so large that it significantly enlarged the Earth's satellite.\n\nB. Most rocks on the Moon\u2019s surface are older than those on the Earth\u2019s surface. This supports the Giant Impact Hypothesis because it suggests that the Moon was formed from the debris of the impact between Earth and Theia, which would have been older than the Earth's crust.\n\nC. The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size. This supports the Giant Impact Hypothesis because it suggests that the Moon was formed from the outer layers of the Earth-Theia collision, which would have resulted in a smaller iron core for the Moon.\n\nD. The Moon was once entirely molten. This supports the Giant Impact Hypothesis because it suggests that the Moon was formed from the molten material resulting from the impact between Earth and Theia, which would have been molten at the time of formation.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided directly support the Giant Impact Hypothesis. The evidence for the hypothesis is based on the characteristics of the Moon and the Earth, as well as the timing and nature of the impact event.",
