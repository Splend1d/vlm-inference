            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where all three cards must be of different suits.\n\nFirst, we need to choose 3 suits out of the 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). This can be done in 4C3 ways, which is 4.\n\nNext, we need to choose 3 cards from the chosen suit. Since there are 13 cards in each suit, this can be done in 13C3 ways, which is 286.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits from a standard deck of 52 cards is 4 * 286 = 1144.\n\nHowever, this problem is asking for the number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits, not the number of ways to choose 3 cards of the same suit. Since there are 4 suits, there are 4 ways to choose 3 cards of the same suit.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits from a standard deck of 52 cards is 1144 - 4 = 1140.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2197.",
