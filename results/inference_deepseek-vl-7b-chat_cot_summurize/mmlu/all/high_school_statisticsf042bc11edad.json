The mean cost for books is $350 with a standard deviation of $65. The mean outlay for room and board is $2800 with a standard deviation of $380. The mean personal expenditure is $675 with a standard deviation of $125. Assuming independence among categories, what is the standard deviation of the total student costs?\n\nA. $24\nB. $91\nC. $190\nD. $405\n",

            "content": "To find the standard deviation of the total student costs, we need to find the standard deviation of each category (tuition, books, room and board, and personal expenditure) and then find the square root of the weighted sum of the variances.\n\nThe variance of a single category can be calculated as:\n\nVariance = (Mean - Mean of the category)\u00b2 / (Standard Deviation of the category)\u00b2\n\nVariance of tuition = (4500 - 4500)\u00b2 / 65\u00b2 = 0\nVariance of books = (350 - 350)\u00b2 / 65\u00b2 = 0\nVariance of room and board = (2800 - 2800)\u00b2 / 380\u00b2 = 0\nVariance of personal expenditure = (675 - 675)\u00b2 / 125\u00b2 = 0\n\nSince all the variances are 0, the standard deviation of each category is 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the standard deviation of the total student costs. The total student costs are the sum of the individual costs, so the standard deviation of the total student costs is the square root of the weighted sum of the variances:\n\nStandard Deviation of Total Student Costs = \u221a(0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a numerical answer, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, the standard deviation of the total student costs is 0, which is not a valid answer. The question seems to have a mistake or inconsistency in its requirements.",
