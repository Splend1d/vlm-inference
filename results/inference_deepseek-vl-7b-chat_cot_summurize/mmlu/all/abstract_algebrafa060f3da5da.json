In R^2, a set of two vectors {v1, v2} is linearly independent if and only if they are not proportional. However, in R^2, there are infinitely many pairs of vectors that are not proportional, so not all sets of two vectors in R^2 are linearly independent.\n\nStatement 2: If V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.\nThis statement is true. The dimension of the span of a set of vectors is equal to the number of vectors in the set. If {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then the dimension of the span of these vectors is k, as each vector is a basis for the space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
