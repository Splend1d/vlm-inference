If the population remains in equilibrium, what would be the expected frequency of that allele after 500 years?\n\nA. It will increase if the allele is favorable or will decrease if it is unfavorable for individuals in that population.\nB. Not enough information is provided to determine if the frequency of the allele will remain the same or change.\nC. The frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3 because the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nD. The frequency of the allele will remain the same; this is an example of the bottleneck effect.\n",
