Which of the following research method choices (and the rationale for the choice) is the most appropriate?\n\nA. Experiment-the most convenient and ethical way to study online bullying is to randomly assign half of the participants to a group who experiences the independent variable (online bullying).\nB. Correlation-it would be unethical to purposefully expose middle school students to bullying behaviors, so Professor Ek should examine variables that correlate with existing instances of online bullying.\nC. Naturalistic observation-observing instances of online bullying by monitoring middle school students' social networking behavior would provide the most accurate data and not raise important privacy concerns, because social networks are considered \"public\" space.\nD. Survey-self-reports about online bullying behaviors and responses to these behaviors would likely provide the most accurate descriptions of bullying and its impact.\n",

Naturalistic observation-observing instances of online bullying by monitoring middle school students' social networking behavior would provide the most accurate data and not raise important privacy concerns, because social networks are considered \"public\" space.\n\nThe rationale for this choice is that naturalistic observation allows for a more accurate and unfiltered understanding of the online bullying behaviors without the potential for bias that can occur in other methods such as experiments or surveys. Additionally, social networking behavior is considered a public space, which means that it is more likely to be honest and reflective of the actual behaviors taking place.",
