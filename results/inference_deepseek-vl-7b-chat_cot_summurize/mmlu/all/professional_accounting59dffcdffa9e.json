In this case, since the question does not specify the modified approach, we can use the straight-line method, which is the most common method for accounting for the useful life of an asset.\n\nUnder the straight-line method, the annual depreciation expense is calculated by dividing the cost of the asset by its useful life. In this case, the cost of the new roads is $800,000 and the useful life is 20 years. Therefore, the annual depreciation expense is $800,000 / 20 = $40,000.\n\nTherefore, the amount that Large City should report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year is $40,000.",
