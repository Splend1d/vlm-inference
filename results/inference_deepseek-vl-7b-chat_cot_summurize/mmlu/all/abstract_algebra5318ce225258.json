            "content": "Statement 1: Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.\nThis statement is true. By definition, a free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements under the operation of addition. In the case of a free abelian group of rank 1 (i.e., a group generated by a single element), there is only one basis, which is the set of all possible sums of the generator and its multiples. However, for a free abelian group of rank greater than 1, there are infinitely many bases, as each element can be expressed as a linear combination of the generators.\n\nStatement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\nThis statement is also true. As mentioned above, for a free abelian group of rank greater than 1, there are infinitely many bases. This is because each element can be expressed as a linear combination of the generators, and there are infinitely many possible combinations of the generators.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.
