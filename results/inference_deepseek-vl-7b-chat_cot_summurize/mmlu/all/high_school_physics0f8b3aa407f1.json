We need to find the focal length f.\n\n1/f = 1/10 - 1/2\n\nTo solve for f, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n1/f = (10 - 5) / (10 * 2)\n1/f = 5 / 20\n\nNow, we can solve for f:\n\nf = 20 / 5\nf = 4 cm\n\nHowever, the focal length must be negative because the image appears behind the mirror. The correct answer is:\n\nB. -5/3 cm",
