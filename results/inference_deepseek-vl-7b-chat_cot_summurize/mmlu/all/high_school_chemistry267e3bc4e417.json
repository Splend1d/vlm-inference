The molecular formula of cholesterol is C27H46O, which means that each molecule contains 27 carbon atoms (C), 46 hydrogen atoms (H), and 1 oxygen atom (O).\n\nThe atomic mass of carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1, and oxygen is 16.\n\nSo, the mass of one molecule of cholesterol is:\n\n(386 g) / (27 * 12 + 46 * 1 + 1 * 16) = 386 g / (336 + 46 + 16) = 386 g / 407 \u2248 0.94 \u00d7 10^-21 g\n\nThis is approximately 1.38 \u00d7 10^-21 g, which is closest to option C.",
