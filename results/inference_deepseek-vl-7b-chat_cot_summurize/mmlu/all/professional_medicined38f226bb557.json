Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/85 mm Hg. Crackles are heard in both lower lung fields. Pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80% of predicted, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume, is 65% of predicted. Histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?\n\nA. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis\nB. Intra-alveolar exudates\nC. Multiple thromboemboli\nD. Necrotizing vasculitis\n",
