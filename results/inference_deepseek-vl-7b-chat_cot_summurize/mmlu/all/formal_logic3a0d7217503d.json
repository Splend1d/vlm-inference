This is a correct representation of the sentence.\n\nOption B: [L \u2283 (B \u2228 D)] \u2022 H\nThis option states that if L (the person lived with you for the entire year) is true, then either B (person was born) or D (person died) is true. This is not a correct representation of the sentence, as it does not include the condition that your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\n\nOption C: L \u2283 [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H]\nThis option states that if L (the person lived with you for the entire year) is true, then either B (person was born) or D (person died) is true and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive. This is a correct representation of the sentence.\n\nOption D: (B \u2228 D \u2022 H) \u2283 L\nThis option states that if either B (person was born) or D (person died) is true and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive, then L (the person lived with you for the entire year) is true. This is a correct representation of the sentence.\n\nComparing all the options, options A and D are the closest representations of the sentence. However, option D is the most complete and accurate representation, as it includes the condition that your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive. Therefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence using propositional logic is option D.",
