A group of adjoining landowners who owned single-family residences sued for an injunction, alleging various environmental violations. The developer did not have a significant investment at that point, and decided to stop the construction.Shortly thereafter, the city passed a comprehensive new citywide zoning law that re-zoned the subject property and some large tracts of adjoining land to low-density residential, allowing one residence for each 4.6 acres. This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?\n\nA. Yes, the state cannot cause such a dramatic diminution in an owner's property without paying just compensation.\nB. Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval \u0080\u0093 the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.\nC. Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.\nD. No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.\n",
