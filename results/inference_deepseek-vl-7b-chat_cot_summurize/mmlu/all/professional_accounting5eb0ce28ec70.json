Baker adopted the MACRS depreciation system and did not utilize any special depreciation deductions. On March 1 of the current year, Baker sold the equipment. The MACRS depreciation schedule for five-year property is listed below:\nFirst year - 20.00%\nSecond year - 32.00%\nThird year - 19.20%\nWhat amount of depreciation can Baker deduct in the current year?\n\nA. $533\nB. $1,600\nC. $2,000\nD. $3,200\n",

            "content": "To find the depreciation amount for the current year, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and then sum them up.\n\nFirst year: 20.00% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000\n\nSecond year: 32.00% of $10,000 = 0.32 * $10,000 = $3,200\n\nThird year: 19.20% of $10,000 = 0.192 * $10,000 = $1,920\n\nTotal depreciation for the current year: $2,000 + $3,200 + $1,920 = $7,120\n\nHowever, the question asks for the depreciation in the current year, which is the year after the purchase. In this case, the depreciation for the current year would be the remaining value of the equipment after the first year's depreciation.\n\nRemaining value after first year: $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000\n\nDepreciation for the current year: $8,000 * 20.00% = 0.20 * $8,000 = $1,600\n\nSo, Baker can deduct $1,600 in the current year. The correct answer is B.",
