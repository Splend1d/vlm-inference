We can calculate the rate for each interval and then find the average rate.\n\nInterval 1: 0 s - 0 disintegrations\nInterval 2: 1 s - 2 disintegrations\nInterval 3: 2 s - 1 disintegration\nInterval 4: 3 s - 2 disintegrations\nInterval 5: 4 s - 0 disintegrations\nInterval 6: 5 s - 2 disintegrations\n\nNow, we can calculate the average rate:\n\n(2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 9 = 20 / 9 \u2248 2.22 disintegrations per second\n\nTo find the uncertainty in the rate, we can use the formula:\n\nUncertainty = (Standard deviation) / (sqrt(Number of measurements))\n\nThe standard deviation is the difference between the mean and the individual measurements:\n\nStandard deviation = 20 - 2.22 \u2248 17.78\n\nThe number of measurements is 9:\n\nUncertainty = 17.78 / sqrt(9) \u2248 17.78 / 3 \u2248 5.93\n\nNow, we can find the time required to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent:\n\n1 percent = 0.01\n\nUncertainty = 5.93\n\nTime = Uncertainty / (1 percent)\n\nTime = 5.93 / 0.01 \u2248 593 s\n\nSince the student made 10 measurements, we can round the time to the nearest whole number:\n\nTime \u2248 593 / 10 \u2248 59.3 s\n\nSince the student cannot count for a fraction of a second, we can round up to the nearest whole number:\n\nTime \u2248 60 s\n\nTherefore, the student should count for at least 60 seconds to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 160 s.",
