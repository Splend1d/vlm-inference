At any time the French capital affords rare advantages to the anthropologist. The Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, the anthropometric operations of Bertillon in the Palais de Justice, the courses of lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, the collections in the Jardin de Plantes, the facilities for original work in the \u00e9coles de Medicine, and the hospitals give to the comparative anatomist and biologist abundant employment.\"\nOtis T. Mason, American ethnologist and curator, 1889\nIt can be inferred from the text that at the time of the Paris Exposition, the scientific community was changing due to\n\nA. the inclusion of women\nB. an increase in funding from officials in the French capital\nC. the development of universal public education in many European countries\nD. the development of new, specialized fields\n",
