Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n\nExplanation: The first step in managing a public relations crisis is to gather accurate and reliable information about the situation. By quickly investigating the cause of the contamination, you can determine whether your product is indeed the source of the problem. This will help you to address the issue effectively and prevent further damage to your brand's reputation.\n\nOption B is not recommended because stopping all sales of the product throughout the nation would be a drastic measure that could harm the company's reputation and financial stability. Option C is not recommended because stopping sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market alone would not address the issue of contamination affecting consumers nationwide. Option D is not recommended because issuing a press release to the Albany, New York, market alone would not address the issue of contamination affecting consumers throughout the nation.",
