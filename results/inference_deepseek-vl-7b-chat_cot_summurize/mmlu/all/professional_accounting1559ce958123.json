Calculate the units to be sold in each quarter.\n3. Calculate the units to be produced in each quarter.\n4. Calculate the units to be produced in the first quarter.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total units to be sold in the year.\nTotal units = Units in the first quarter + Units in the second quarter + Units in the third quarter + Units in the fourth quarter\nTotal units = 30000 + 40000 + 22500 + 27500 = 120000\n\nStep 2: Calculate the units to be sold in each quarter.\nUnits in the first quarter = 30% of the units in the second quarter\nUnits in the first quarter = 0.30 * 40000 = 12000\n\nUnits in the second quarter = 30% of the units in the third quarter\nUnits in the second quarter = 0.30 * 22500 = 6750\n\nUnits in the third quarter = 30% of the units in the fourth quarter\nUnits in the third quarter = 0.30 * 27500 = 8250\n\nUnits in the fourth quarter = 30% of the units in the first quarter\nUnits in the fourth quarter = 0.30 * 30000 = 9000\n\nStep 3: Calculate the units to be produced in each quarter.\nUnits to be produced in the first quarter = Units in the first quarter - Units in the second quarter\nUnits to be produced in the first quarter = 12000 - 6750 = 5250\n\nUnits to be produced in the second quarter = Units in the second quarter - Units in the third quarter\nUnits to be produced in the second quarter = 6750 - 8250 = 1500\n\nUnits to be produced in the third quarter = Units in the third quarter - Units in the fourth quarter\nUnits to be produced in the third quarter = 8250 - 9000 = 750\n\nUnits to be produced in the fourth quarter = 0 (since there are no units to be produced in the fourth quarter)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the units to be produced in the first quarter.\nUnits to be produced in the first quarter = Units to be produced in the first quarter\nUnits to be produced in the first quarter = 5250\n\nThe production budget should show 5250 units to be produced during the first quarter. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 36000",
