In the context of international law, a persistent objector could be a state that consistently and publicly objects to the formation or application of a rule of customary international law. This is because customary international law is not created by a single authoritative decision, but rather is developed through the consistent practice of states over a long period of time. If a state consistently and publicly objects to the formation or application of a rule of customary international law from its inception, it can be considered a persistent objector.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The State which persistently and publicly objects to the formation of a rule of customary law from its outset",
