As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things.\"\nFrancis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620\nBy the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning reflected in the passage had undergone which of the following changes?\n\nA.

            "content": "The passage you provided is from Francis Bacon's Novum Organum, written in 1620. It discusses the two ways of investigating and discovering truth, which are the empirical method and the inductive method. The empirical method, which is the one in use at the time, starts from the senses and particulars and moves towards the most general axioms. The inductive method, which is the unattempted but true way, starts from the senses and particulars and moves towards the most general axioms.\n\nBy the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning, which is the one in use at the time, had undergone several changes. The passage does not mention that the method had weakened to the point of irrelevance, so option A is not correct. It also does not mention that the method had become a core principle of European culture, so option B is not correct. The passage does not mention that the method had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those who pioneered it, so option C is not correct.\n\nThe passage does mention that the method had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life. This suggests that the method had become outdated and needed to be replaced. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
