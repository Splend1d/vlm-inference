So, the total cost of the uniforms is:\n\n46 (uniform cost) \u00d7 12 (number of uniforms) = 552\n\nNow, let's check the other options:\n\nA. (40 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 2) = 400 + 12\nThis equation is wrong because it's not multiplying the uniform cost by the number of uniforms.\n\nB. (40 \u00d7 6) + (10 \u00d7 2) = 240 + 20\nThis equation is wrong because it's not multiplying the uniform cost by the number of uniforms.\n\nC. (40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 72\nThis equation is wrong because it's not multiplying the uniform cost by the number of uniforms.\n\nD. (40 \u00d7 12) + (60 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 720\nThis equation is correct because it's multiplying the uniform cost by the number of uniforms.\n\nSo, the correct equation is D.
