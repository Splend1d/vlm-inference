            "content": "The question is asking about the expected phenotypic ratios of offspring when an affected male and a normal female reproduce. The phenotypic ratio refers to the proportion of offspring with a particular trait.\n\nIn this case, the trait is the presence of MERRF, which is an extremely rare disorder affecting neuromuscular systems. The disorder is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production.\n\nThe question does not provide any information about the inheritance pattern of MERRF. However, we can use some general principles of genetics to make an educated guess.\n\nMERRF is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that both copies of the gene (one from each parent) must be affected for the individual to have the disorder. If only one copy is affected, the individual will be a carrier of the disorder but not have the symptoms.\n\nSince the father is affected, he must have at least one affected copy of the gene. The mother, who is normal, must have a normal copy of the gene. When they reproduce, the probability of each offspring inheriting an affected copy of the gene is 1/2.\n\nIf both offspring inherit an affected copy of the gene, they will have the disorder. If one offspring inherits an affected copy and the other inherits a normal copy, they will be carriers of the disorder.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio of offspring is 1/2 affected and 1/2 normal.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
