            "content": "The correct answer is D.\n\nThe spring-block oscillator is a simple mechanical system where a block is attached to a spring with a spring constant k and an amplitude A. The block has a mass m, and a small block with the same mass is placed on top of the original block.\n\nWhen the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, the small block will be at its maximum displacement as well. At this point, the potential energy of the system is at its maximum.\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy of the system (kinetic energy of the small block and potential energy of the spring) must be conserved. This means that the kinetic energy of the small block must be equal to the potential energy of the spring at the maximum displacement.\n\nThe potential energy of the spring is given by the formula PE = kA(M+m)g, where PE is the potential energy, k is the spring constant, A is the amplitude, M is the mass of the original block, and m is the mass of the small block.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the small block is given by the formula KE = (M+m)g(1 - cos(2\u03c0f)), where KE is the kinetic energy, M+m is the total mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and f is the frequency of oscillation.\n\nAt the maximum displacement, the frequency of oscillation is given by f = (kA(M+m))/(m(M+m+2m)).\n\nSince the total energy of the system is conserved, we have:\n\nKE = PE\n(M+m)g(1 - cos(2\u03c0f)) = kA(M+m)g\n\nNow, we can compare this equation with the condition for the small block to slide off:\n\nThe coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/([(M+m)g] + (kA/(M+m)g)).\n\nSince the coefficient of static friction is greater than the ratio of the potential energy to the total energy, the small block will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction is greater than kA/([(M+m)g] + (kA/(M+m)g)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.",
