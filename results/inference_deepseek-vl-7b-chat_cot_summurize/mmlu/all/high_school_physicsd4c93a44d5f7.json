The mass of the moon is 1/80th the mass of the Earth, and the radius of the moon is 1/4th the radius of the Earth.\n\nFirst, let's find the mass of the moon:\nMass of the moon = 1/80 * Mass of the Earth\nMass of the moon = 1/80 * 80 N\nMass of the moon = 1 N\n\nNow, let's find the radius of the moon:\nRadius of the moon = 1/4 * Radius of the Earth\nRadius of the moon = 1/4 * 6.371 * 10^6 m\nRadius of the moon = 1.5928 * 10^6 m\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the box on the moon using the formula:\nWeight on the moon = Mass of the box * Gravity on the moon\nWeight on the moon = 80 N * (1/6.371 * 10^6 m)\nWeight on the moon = 16 N\n\nSo, the weight of the box on the moon is 16 N, which corresponds to option C.",
