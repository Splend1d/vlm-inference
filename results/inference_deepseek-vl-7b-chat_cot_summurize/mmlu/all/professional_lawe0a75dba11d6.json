While carefully and skillfully operating his airplane, he suddenly realized that one of his engines was gone. He was then forced to make an emergency landing under the reasonable belief that it was necessary to do so for the protection of himself and his airplane. He landed in a farmer's orange grove and managed to steer the plane and land it between the trees in order to not cause damage to any of them. If the farmer brings suit against the rancher for trespass, the most likely result is that the farmer will\n\nA. recover, because the property belonged to a private person.\nB. recover, because the rancher had reasonable grounds to believe that the orange grove belonged to a private person.\nC. not recover, because the rancher was privileged to enter the land of another under the circumstances.\nD. not recover, because the rancher was carefully and skillfully operating his airplane when the engine went out.\n",

In this situation, he was not intentionally causing harm or trespassing, but rather trying to protect himself and his plane. The farmer cannot sue the rancher for trespass because the rancher was acting under reasonable belief that it was necessary to land in the orange grove for his safety. This is known as the \"emergency doctrine,\" which allows individuals to enter private property in order to avoid danger or protect themselves. Therefore, the farmer would not be able to recover damages from the rancher in this case.",
