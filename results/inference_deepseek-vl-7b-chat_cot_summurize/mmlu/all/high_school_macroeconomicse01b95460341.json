            "content": "To calculate the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase, we need to find the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect is the ratio of the initial expenditure to the final expenditure, which represents the total increase in GDP.\n\nLet's denote the initial expenditure as E and the final expenditure as F. In this case, E is the cost of the golf ball ($1) and F is the total increase in GDP.\n\nThe multiplier effect can be calculated as:\n\nMultiplier effect = (Final expenditure / Initial expenditure)\n\nWe are given the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) as 0.75, which means that for every dollar of income, 75 cents is spent on consumption. Therefore, the final expenditure F can be calculated as:\n\nF = (Initial expenditure * MPC)\n\nNow, we can calculate the multiplier effect:\n\nMultiplier effect = (F / E) = ((E * MPC) / E) = MPC\n\nSince the multiplier effect is equal to the MPC, we can conclude that the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase is:\n\nTotal increase in GDP = $1 * 0.75 = $0.75\n\nHowever, the options provided are in dollars, so we need to convert the result to dollars:\n\nTotal increase in GDP = $0.75 * 100 = $75\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $4.",
