            "content": "To determine the amount Rune should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet, we need to consider the transactions that occurred between December 31 and January 9.\n\n1. On December 31, Rune's checkbook balance was $10,000.\n2. On December 31, Rune had a check payable to Rune postdated January 3, which was not included in the December 31 checkbook balance. This check was for $4,000 and was not collected due to it being postdated.\n3. On December 15, Rune deposited a check payable to Rune for $1,000. This check was included in the December 31 checkbook balance but was returned by the bank on December 30 as \"NSF\" (non-sufficient funds). The check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cash Rune should report on December 31:\n\n- Cash on hand: $10,000 (December 31 checkbook balance)\n- Postdated check: $4,000 (not collected due to postdating)\n- Deposited check: $1,000 (returned and redeposited)\n\nTotal cash: $10,000 + $4,000 + $1,000 = $15,000\n\nHowever, the question asks for the amount Rune should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet. Since the postdated check was not collected and the deposited check was returned and redeposited, Rune should not report these as cash. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $9,000",
