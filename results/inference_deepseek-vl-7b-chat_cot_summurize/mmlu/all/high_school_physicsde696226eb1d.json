            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the centripetal force acting on a charged particle in a magnetic field:\n\nF_c = q * B * r\n\nwhere F_c is the centripetal force, q is the charge of the particle (which is -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C for an electron), B is the magnetic field strength (5 \u00d7 10^-5 T), and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the magnetic field strength from T to N/A^2:\n\nB = 5 \u00d7 10^-5 T = 5 \u00d7 10^-5 * (1 N/A^2) = 5 \u00d7 10^-10 N/A^2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nF_c = -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * 5 \u00d7 10^-10 N/A^2 * r\n\nSince the electron is moving in the opposite direction of the magnetic field, the centripetal force is equal to the kinetic energy of the electron:\n\nF_c = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the electron (9.1 \u00d7 10^-31 kg) and v is its speed (10^7 m/s).\n\nNow we can solve for the radius:\n\n(1/2) * 9.1 \u00d7 10^-31 kg * (10^7 m/s)^2 = -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * 5 \u00d7 10^-10 N/A^2 * r\n\nr = -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * 5 \u00d7 10^-10 N/A^2 * (1/2) * 9.1 \u00d7 10^-31 kg * (10^7 m/s)^2 / (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * 5 \u00d7 10^-10 N/A^2)\n\nr = 10^14 m\n\nThe radius of the circle is 10^14 meters, which is equal to 1000 km.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1 m",
