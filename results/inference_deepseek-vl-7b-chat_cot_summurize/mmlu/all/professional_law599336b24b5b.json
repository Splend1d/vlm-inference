            "content": "A defendant suspected her long-term boyfriend was cheating on her. On a hunch, she went to her boyfriend's apartment one afternoon and, using her key, she entered the apartment. Once inside, she found her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in bed together. In a rage, the defendant retrieved the gun from the nightstand and killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend. After the shooting, the defendant left on a two-day trip to the mountains to get the week's events off her mind. She called her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment while she was gone and to look after her 4-year-old daughter. That night, after the defendant left, the police came to the apartment. They asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found in the defendant's bedroom the gun used to kill her boyfriend. At a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial, which of the following facts would the defendant's attorney be LEAST likely to attempt to prove?\n\nA. The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\nB. The police did not have a search warrant.\nC. The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.\nD. The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking which of the following facts the defendant's attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove at a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial. \n\nA. The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment. This fact is relevant because if the defendant gave her neighbor the keys, then the neighbor had the authority to give the police permission to search the apartment. This fact would not help the defendant's attorney in their argument against the search.\n\nB. The police did not have a search warrant. This fact is relevant because if the police did not have a search warrant, then they did not have the legal authority to search the apartment. This fact would help the defendant's attorney in their argument against the search.\n\nC. The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone. This fact is not relevant to the motion to suppress the gun. Whether the defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door or not does not affect the legality of the search.\n\nD. The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search. This fact is relevant because if the police threatened the neighbor with arrest if she refused to give permission, then the neighbor may have felt pressured to give permission. This fact would help the defendant's attorney in their argument against the search.\n\nTherefore, the defendant's attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove that the defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
