            "content": "To determine which of the given options must also be ideals of R, we need to check if each of them satisfies the properties of an ideal. An ideal I of a ring R is said to satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. Closure under multiplication: If a and b are in I, then ab is in I.\n2. Closure under additive inverses: If a is in I, then -a is in I.\n3. Non-zero divisors: If a is in I and b is in I, then ab is in I.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nI. {u + v : u \\in and v \\in V}\nThis set is closed under addition, but it is not closed under multiplication. For example, if u and v are in V, then uv is not in V. Therefore, this set is not an ideal of R.\n\nII. {uv : u \\in U and v \\in V}\nThis set is closed under multiplication, but it is not closed under addition. For example, if u and v are in U and v is in V, then uv is not in U. Therefore, this set is not an ideal of R.\n\nIII. {x : x \\in U and x \\in V}\nThis set is closed under multiplication and addition, and it is non-zero. For example, if u and v are in U and v is in V, then uv is in U and uv is in V. Therefore, this set is an ideal of R.\n\nSince only option III satisfies all the properties of an ideal, the answer is B.",
