The standard topology on R^2 is the topology generated by the open balls of radius 1 centered at the origin. In other words, the open sets in this topology are of the form {x \u2208 R^2 | d(x, 0) < 1}, where d(x, 0) is the Euclidean distance between x and the origin.\n\nNow, let's analyze the properties of S with respect to this topology:\n\n1. Closedness: A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of S in R^2 is the set of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] for which x or y are rational. This set is open because it is the union of open balls of radius 1 centered at the points where x and y are rational. Therefore, S is closed.\n\n2. Openness: A set is open if it is a subset of an open set. Since S is closed, it is also open.\n\n3. Connectedness: A set is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In this case, S cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets because the complement of S in R^2 is not connected. Therefore, S is connected.\n\n4. Totally disconnectedness: A set is totally disconnected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In this case, S cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets because the complement of S in R^2 is not totally disconnected. Therefore, S is totally disconnected.\n\nIn conclusion, S is closed, open, connected, and totally disconnected with respect to the standard topology on R^2. Therefore, the answer is A, B, C, and D.",
