We need to find the number of lamps (L) that will provide this illuminance.\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for L:\n\nL = (I * Area) / Lm/m\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nL = (50 * 12) / 300\n\nL = 600 / 300\n\nL = 2\n\nSo, 2 lamps, each with 300 lumens, will be required to obtain an average illuminance of 50 lux in a 4m * 3m rectangular room.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 2.",
