The unlevered value is the value of the firm if it were not levered, meaning it would not have any debt.\n\nUnlevered value = Value of the firm if unlevered = $4.78 million\n\nNext, we need to find the tax shield. The tax shield is the difference between the unlevered value and the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs.\n\nTax shield = Unlevered value - Present value of bankruptcy and agency costs\nTax shield = $4.78 million - $360,000\n\nTax shield = $4.42 million\n\nNow, we need to find the levered value of the firm. The levered value is the unlevered value plus the present value of debt.\n\nLevered value = Unlevered value + Present value of debt\nLevered value = $4.78 million + $360,000\n\nLevered value = $5.14 million\n\nFinally, we need to find the tax shield. The tax shield is the difference between the levered value and the unlevered value.\n\nTax shield = Levered value - Unlevered value\nTax shield = $5.14 million - $4.78 million\n\nTax shield = $0.36 million\n\nThe value of the tax shield is $0.36 million, which is not listed in the given options. However, if we need to choose from the given options, the closest value would be option B, which is $220,000.",
