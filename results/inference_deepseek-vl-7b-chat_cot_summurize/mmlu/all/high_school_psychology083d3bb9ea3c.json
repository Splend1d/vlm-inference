            "content": "In a meeting with the school psychologist, Ms. Harcar, a new sixth-grade teacher, expresses some concerns about a student, Anthony. The school psychologist has worked with the boy and knows him well. Anthony has a mild learning disability and receives academic support. He is doing well on a daily basis but has difficulty performing on tests. The school psychologist discusses ways in which Ms. Harcar could incorporate study-skills training into classroom activities. With regard to study-skills training, the school psychologist should stress which of the following principles while advising Ms. Harcar?\n\nA. The study skills of students with disabilities are improved when they are given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects.\nB. Students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and need only some guidance and reinforcement by the teacher.\nC. Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\nD. Study strategies are best taught in a small group by having students practice collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher.\n",

            "content": "The school psychologist should stress the principle that training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches. This principle aligns with the idea of empowering students to take control of their learning and to adapt their study strategies to their individual needs.\n\nOption A is not the best choice because it suggests a one-size-fits-all approach to study strategies, which may not be effective for all students, especially those with learning disabilities.\n\nOption B is not the best choice because it underestimates the role of the teacher in helping students with disabilities develop study skills. While students may develop some skills on their own, they still need guidance and reinforcement from their teachers.\n\nOption D is not the best choice because it focuses on teaching study strategies in a small group setting, which may not be the most effective approach for all students. Additionally, the focus on collaborative problem-solving activities may not be the most appropriate for all students, especially those with learning disabilities.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C, which emphasizes the importance of helping students to guide their own thinking, organize their own study behaviors, and use varied study approaches. This approach aligns with the idea of empowering students to take control of their learning and to adapt their study strategies to their individual needs.",
