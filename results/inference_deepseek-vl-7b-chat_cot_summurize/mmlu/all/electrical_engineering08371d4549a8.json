In a long, straight wire carrying a current, the electric field is strongest midway between the wire and the ground. This is because the electric field lines extend from the positive charge (the wire) to the negative charge (the ground). At the surface of the conductor, the electric field is tangent to the surface, so the electric stress is lower. At the ground surface, the electric field is parallel to the surface, so the electric stress is also lower. Therefore, the maximum electric stress occurs midway between the conductor and ground.",
