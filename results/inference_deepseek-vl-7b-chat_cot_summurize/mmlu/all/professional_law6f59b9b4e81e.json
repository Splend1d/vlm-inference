The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council.

Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\n\nThe state law in question is discriminatory against certain businesses and violates the principle of equal protection under the law. The National Trade Council, which includes 30 of the businesses affected by the state law, is arguing that this discrimination is unconstitutional. The federal government, through the U.S. Congress, has enacted a statute that seeks to normalize relations with Cuba, and it is likely that a federal court would interpret this as a higher level of policy that the state law should be consistent with. Therefore, the federal court is likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional.",
