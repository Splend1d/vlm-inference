            "content": "To bring the sphere to rest, we need to apply a frictional force that will cause the sphere to lose its kinetic energy and come to rest. The kinetic energy of the sphere is given by:\n\nKE = 0.5 * I * \u03c9^2\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia (0.06 kg\u00b7m^2), \u03c9 is the angular speed (20 rad/s), and KE is the kinetic energy.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angular speed from radians to rad/s:\n\n\u03c9 = 20 rad/s * (1 s / 2\u03c0) = 10/\u03c0 rad/s\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy:\n\nKE = 0.5 * 0.06 kg\u00b7m^2 * (10/\u03c0 rad/s)^2 = 0.003 kg\u00b7m^2\u00b7s^2\n\nNext, we need to find the frictional force that will bring the sphere to rest. The frictional force is given by:\n\nF_f = m * a\n\nwhere m is the mass of the sphere (0.06 kg) and a is the acceleration due to the frictional force. We can find the acceleration by dividing the kinetic energy by the mass:\n\na = KE / m = 0.003 kg\u00b7m^2\u00b7s^2 / 0.06 kg = 0.05 m/s^2\n\nNow, we can find the frictional force:\n\nF_f = m * a = 0.06 kg * 0.05 m/s^2 = 0.003 N\n\nFinally, we can find the time it takes for the sphere to come to rest by dividing the frictional force by the moment of inertia:\n\nt = F_f / I = 0.003 N / 0.06 kg\u00b7m^2 = 0.005 s\n\nSo, it will take 0.005 s for the sphere to come to rest. However, this is not an option in the given choices. The problem may have an error or the answer may be rounded to a different decimal place.",
