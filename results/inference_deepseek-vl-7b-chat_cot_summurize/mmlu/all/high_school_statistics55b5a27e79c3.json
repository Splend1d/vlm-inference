He decides to construct a simulation to estimate the mean number of customers he needs to contact before being able to sell a policy. Which of the following schemes should he use to do the simulation?\n\nA. Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\nB. Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\nC. Assign number 0 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and number 1 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\nD. Assign numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D.\n\nExplanation: The agent needs to find the mean number of customers he needs to contact before being able to sell a policy. This is a binomial distribution problem, where the probability of success (selling a policy) is 20% and the probability of failure (not selling a policy) is 80%.\n\nIn this case, the agent needs to find the mean number of customers he needs to contact before selling a policy. This is a binomial distribution problem, where the probability of success (selling a policy) is 20% and the probability of failure (not selling a policy) is 80%.\n\nThe mean number of customers he needs to contact before selling a policy can be calculated using the formula:\n\nMean = (n * p) / (1 - p)\n\nWhere n is the number of customers he needs to contact, p is the probability of success (20%), and (1 - p) is the probability of failure (80%).\n\nUsing the formula with the given probabilities, we get:\n\nMean = (n * 0.2) / (1 - 0.8)\n\nMean = (n * 0.2) / 0.2\n\nMean = n\n\nSo, the agent needs to contact the same number of customers he needs to contact before selling a policy. Therefore, the mean number of customers he needs to contact before selling a policy is 1.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either assign different numbers to successfully selling a policy or failing to sell a policy, or they assign different numbers to the mean number of customers he needs to contact before selling a policy.",
