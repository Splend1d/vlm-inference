            "content": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was a significant agreement between the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal. This treaty was a result of the ongoing disputes between these kingdoms over the lands discovered during the Age of Exploration. The treaty established a line, known as the Tordesillas Line, which was drawn straight from the Cape Verde Islands to the Antarctic pole, 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. This line divided the Atlantic Ocean into two sections, with Portugal having the rights to the lands discovered to the west of the line, and Spain having the rights to the lands discovered to the east of the line.\n\nThis treaty demonstrates that monarchs were indeed involved in and interested in voyages of discovery. The fact that the treaty was signed by representatives of the King and Queen of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, and the King of Portugal and the Algarves, as well as the fact that the dispute was over the lands discovered during the Age of Exploration, shows that monarchs were directly involved in the exploration and colonization efforts.\n\nThe treaty does not provide evidence for joint-stock companies sponsoring colonization efforts in the western and eastern hemispheres, as there is no mention of such companies or their involvement in the treaty.\n\nThe treaty does not provide evidence for the trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa, as the treaty is specifically about the division of lands discovered during the Age of Exploration, not about trade or colonization.\n\nThe treaty does not provide evidence for the Scientific Revolution and the discovery of heliocentricity, as the treaty is about the division of lands discovered during the Age of Exploration, not about scientific discoveries or theories.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery.",
