Collision B: the ball and the rod each experience the same torque, time of collision, and change in rotational kinetic energy.\n\nIn Collision A, the two carts collide and bounce off each other. The force, time of collision, and change in kinetic energy experienced by each cart will be the same. This is because the collision is elastic, meaning that the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved.\n\nIn Collision B, a ball sticks to a rigid rod, which begins to rotate about the combined center of mass. The ball and the rod each experience the same torque, time of collision, and change in rotational kinetic energy. This is because the torque is the product of the force applied to the system and the distance from the pivot point (the center of mass in this case). Since the force and distance are the same for both the ball and the rod, the torque experienced by each will be the same. Additionally, the time of collision and change in rotational kinetic energy will also be the same for both the ball and the rod, as they are both part of the same system.",
