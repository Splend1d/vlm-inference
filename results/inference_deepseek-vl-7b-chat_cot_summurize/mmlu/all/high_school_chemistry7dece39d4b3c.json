The entropy change is most negative when the reaction is endothermic (\u0394H < 0) and the enthalpy change is most positive when the reaction is exothermic (\u0394H > 0).\n\nA. C(s) + CO2(g) \u2192 2 CO(g)\n\u0394H = -131 kJ/mol (endothermic)\n\u0394S = -143 J/mol K (negative entropy change)\n\nB. 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \u2192 Na2O2(s)\n\u0394H = -112 kJ/mol (endothermic)\n\u0394S = -143 J/mol K (negative entropy change)\n\nC.

However, since all reactions have a negative entropy change, the entropy decrease will be the same for all reactions. Therefore, the reaction with the greatest decrease in entropy is:\n\nC.
