            "content": "To determine the total amount of gross income from Ball that should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income, we need to consider the distribution made by Ball to its partners. Vale received a $10,000 distribution, which is equal to 50% of the $20,000 distribution made by Ball.\n\nSo, Vale's share of the distribution is $10,000. This amount should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total gross income from Ball for Vale:\n\nTotal gross income = Vale's share of the distribution + Vale's tax basis in Ball\nTotal gross income = $10,000 + $60,000\nTotal gross income = $70,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $16,000",
