They point out that some households in the community are exposed to chemical waste from a nearby factory. They believe that chemical waste causes leukemia. If a study is designed to evaluate the hospital officials\u2019 claim, which of the following subjects are most likely to comprise the control group?\n\nA. Children exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL\nB. Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL\nC.

The control group should be similar to the group being studied, except for the variable of interest.\n\nOption A: Children exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL - This group would not be a good control group because they are exposed to the chemical waste, which is the variable of interest.\n\nOption B: Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL - This group would be a good control group because they are not exposed to the chemical waste, which is the variable of interest. They are also similar to the group being studied in terms of age and the absence of ALL.\n\nOption C: Children from the hospital\u2019s outpatient clinic who do not suffer from ALL - This group would not be a good control group because they are not exposed to the chemical waste, which is the variable of interest.\n\nOption D: Children not exposed to the chemical waste who suffer from ALL - This group would not be a good control group because they are exposed to the chemical waste, which is the variable of interest.\n\nTherefore, the most likely subjects to comprise the control group are children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
