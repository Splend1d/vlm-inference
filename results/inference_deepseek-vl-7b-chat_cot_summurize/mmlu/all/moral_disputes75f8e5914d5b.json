This suggests that Ashford believes justice is about promoting the well-being and flourishing of individuals, and that one way to do this is to ensure that legal and economic systems enable people to reach their full potential.\n\nOption B, minimizing the amount of suffering in the world, is also a valid criterion for justice, but it is not necessarily the most comprehensive one. While reducing suffering is certainly important, it does not capture the full range of what it means for a system to be just.\n\nOption C, recognizing, enforcing, and implementing duties not to violate human rights, is also a valid criterion for justice. However, Ashford's focus on human capabilities suggests that he may see this as a necessary but not sufficient condition for justice.\n\nOption D, universalizability, is a criterion for moral and legal validity, but it is not a criterion for justice. Justice is about fairness and the distribution of goods and burdens, not about whether a rule can be applied consistently across all possible situations.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, Ashford's test for whether legal and economic structures are minimally just is whether they help develop human capabilities.",
