To correct this, we need to subtract the overstatement from the reported ending inventory.\n\n$152,500 (reported pretax income) - $30,000 (overstated ending inventory) = $122,500\n\n2. Depreciation expense: The depreciation expense is understated by $64,000. To correct this, we need to add the understatement to the reported depreciation expense.\n\n$122,500 (corrected ending inventory) + $64,000 (understated depreciation expense) = $186,500\n\nTherefore, Mill should report the correct pretax income as $186,500. The correct answer is C. $186,500.",
