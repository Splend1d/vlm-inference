            "content": "To calculate the component cost of preferred stock, we need to find the present value of the annual dividend payments. The formula for the present value of an annuity is:\n\nPV = (A / (1 + r)^n)\n\nwhere PV is the present value, A is the annual annuity payment, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case, the annual dividend payment is $10, the discount rate is 40% (0.40), and the number of periods is 1 (since the dividend is paid annually).\n\nSo, the present value of the annual dividend payment is:\n\nPV = (10 / (1 + 0.40)^1)\nPV = (10 / (1.40)^1)\nPV = (10 / 1.40)\nPV = $7.14\n\nThe component cost of preferred stock is the present value of the annual dividend payments divided by the current market price per share:\n\nComponent cost = PV / Market price\nComponent cost = $7.14 / $96\nComponent cost = 0.745\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the component cost of preferred stock is closest to 0.75, which is 7.5% or 7.50% when expressed as a percentage.\n\nHowever, the options provided are in the form of decimals, so we need to convert 7.50% to a decimal:\n\n7.50% = 0.075\n\nThe closest option to 0.075 is 0.06, which is 6% when expressed as a percentage.\n\nTherefore, the component cost of preferred stock would be closest to 6 percent (Option A).",
