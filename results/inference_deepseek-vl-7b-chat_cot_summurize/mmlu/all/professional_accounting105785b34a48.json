Maintain redundant systems for instant availability to assure the flow of transactions\n\nThis is because in an e-commerce environment, any downtime can lead to significant losses in revenue and customer trust. Therefore, it is crucial to have redundant systems in place to ensure that the flow of transactions is not disrupted.\n\nA. Maintain appropriate written source documents so the data can be re-entered if it is lost or compromised - While this is important, it is not as crucial as maintaining redundant systems for instant availability. If the data is lost or compromised, it can be re-entered, but if the system is down, the transactions cannot be processed.\n\nC. Review additional expenses to obtain the required amount of business interruption insurance coverage for the organization - While this is important, it is not as crucial as maintaining redundant systems for instant availability. Business interruption insurance can help cover losses due to downtime, but it cannot prevent downtime from occurring in the first place.\n\nD. Assure that appropriate data backups are stored in an off-site location - While this is important, it is not as crucial as maintaining redundant systems for instant availability. Data backups can help restore data in case of a system failure, but they cannot prevent system failures from occurring in the first place.",
