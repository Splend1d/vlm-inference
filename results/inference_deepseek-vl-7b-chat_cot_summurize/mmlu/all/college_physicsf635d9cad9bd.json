            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula, which states that the observed wavelength of a wave is related to the source's velocity relative to the observer. The formula is:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = (v * c) / (1 + z)\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the observed wavelength shift, v is the velocity of the source relative to the observer, c is the speed of light, and z is the redshift.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the observed wavelength shift is three times the wavelength of hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. The wavelength of hydrogen atoms at rest is \u03bb = 121.57 nm. Therefore, the observed wavelength shift is 3 * 121.57 nm = 364.71 nm.\n\nWe are also given that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth. This means that the velocity of the quasar relative to Earth is the same as the velocity of the Earth relative to the quasar. Let's denote this velocity as v.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\n364.71 nm = (v * c) / (1 + z)\n\nWe are asked to find the relative speed of the quasar, which is the same as the velocity of the Earth relative to the quasar. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nv = 364.71 nm / (1 + z)\n\nSince we are given that the redshift is 3, we can plug this value into the equation:\n\nv = 364.71 nm / (1 + 3)\nv = 364.71 nm / 4\nv = 91.1775 nm / 4\nv = 22.7944 nm / 1\nv = 22.7944 nm / 10^9 m/s\nv = 2.27944 * 10^(-8) m/s\n\nSo, the relative speed of the quasar is approximately 2.27944 * 10^(-8) m/s.\n\nNow, let's convert this speed to units that are more appropriate for the context of the problem. The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the quasar is:\n\n2.27944 * 10^(-8) m/s / 3 * 10^8 m/s = 2.27944 * 10^(-8) / 3 * 10^8 = 2.27944 * 10^(-10)\n\nThis is approximately 0.000000000227944 m/s.\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided are not in this format. To match the answer choices, we need to convert this speed to a more appropriate unit. The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the quasar is:\n\n0.000000000227944 m/s / 3 * 10^8 m/s = 2.27944 * 10^(-10) / 3 * 10^8 = 2.27944 * 10^(-10)\n\nThis is approximately 0.000000000227944 m/s.\n\nSince the answer choices are not in this format, we cannot determine which of the given answer choices is correct.",
