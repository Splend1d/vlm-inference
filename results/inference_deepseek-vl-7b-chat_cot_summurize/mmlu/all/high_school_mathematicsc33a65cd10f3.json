Since the original length of the paper is 8.5 inches, the length of the shorter side before the first fold is $\\frac{8.5}{2}=4.25$ inches. After the first fold, the length of the shorter side becomes $\\frac{8.5}{2}=4.25$ inches, which is the same as the length of the longest side before the second fold. Therefore, the length of the longest side immediately after the second fold is $\\boxed{4.25}$ inches.\nThe answer is: 4.25",
