            "content": "A state on the eastern seaboard has a long stretch of scenic, ecologically unique, and relatively unspoiled seacoast. Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking what the man must establish in order to prevail in his action to establish title to the walkway area. The man has been using the area in excess of the period required for adverse possession, which means he has been using the area without the permission of the State Coastal Commission. \n\nOption A is not relevant to the man's claim. The man's claim is not about abandonment by a governmental entity, but about adverse possession.\n\nOption B is also not relevant. The man's claim is not about an irrevocable license, but about adverse possession.\n\nOption D is not relevant either. The man's claim is not about a defect in the chain of title, but about adverse possession.\n\nOption C, however, is relevant. The man's claim is about adverse possession, and in order to prevail, he must establish that the state has lost its real property interest in the walkway area through his use of the area in excess of the period required for adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
