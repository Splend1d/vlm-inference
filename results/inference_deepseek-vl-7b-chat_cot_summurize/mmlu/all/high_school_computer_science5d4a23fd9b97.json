The program displays 10, and the programmer concludes that the program works as intended. Which of the following is true?\n\nA. The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended.\nB. The conclusion is incorrect; the program does not display the correct value for the test case [0, 1, 4, 5].\nC. The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct.\nD. The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] only confirms that the program works for lists in increasing order.\n",
