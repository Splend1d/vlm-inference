            "content": "Gold (Au) is a noble gas, meaning it is in the 18th group of the periodic table. The electrons in the noble gases have a specific configuration of their orbitals, which is determined by the atomic number (Z) and the principal quantum number (n).\n\nFor gold (Au), the atomic number is 79, and the principal quantum number (n) is 1. The configuration of the electrons in the noble gases is:\n\nn = 1, l = 0\nn = 2, l = 0\nn = 3, l = 0\n...\nn = 18, l = 0\n\nSince gold (Au) is in the 18th group, it has 18 electrons in its outermost shell. However, the question asks for electrons with a quantum number l = 2. In the noble gases, the electrons with l = 2 are in the 4th and 5th orbitals.\n\nFor gold (Au), the 4th and 5th orbitals are already occupied by electrons with l = 0. Therefore, gold (Au) does not have any electrons with a quantum number l = 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0",
