            "content": "A. DNA viruses\n\nDNA viruses are known to be hypermutable, meaning they can easily change their genetic material. This is due to their ability to replicate their DNA through a process called reverse transcription, which allows them to make copies of their genetic material. This makes them more adaptable to changing environments and can make them more difficult to treat.\n\nB. 'Emerging' viruses\n\nEmerging viruses are those that are newly discovered or are becoming more prevalent. They can be hypermutable, but this is not a specific characteristic of emerging viruses.\n\nC. Influenza and HIV\n\nInfluenza and HIV are both RNA viruses, and while they can be hypermutable, it is not a defining characteristic of either virus. Influenza is known for its ability to change its surface proteins, which allows it to evade the immune system, while HIV is known for its ability to mutate its genetic material to evade antiretroviral drugs.\n\nD. RNA viruses\n\nRNA viruses are known to be hypermutable, but this is not a specific characteristic of all RNA viruses. Some RNA viruses, such as the flu virus, are known to be hypermutable, while others, such as the common cold virus, are not.",
