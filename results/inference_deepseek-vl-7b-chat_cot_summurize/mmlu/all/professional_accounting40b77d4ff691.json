            "content": "A nonissuer is a company or organization that does not issue its own securities, such as stocks or bonds. An auditor is an independent professional who examines an organization's financial statements to ensure they are accurate and comply with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nThe auditor's role is to provide an opinion on the financial statements, based on the audit evidence they have gathered. This evidence should be sufficient to support the auditor's opinion that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe options you provided are related to the auditor's responsibilities in the audit process:\n\nA. The planned level of control risk: This refers to the level of risk that the auditor has identified in the audit plan, based on the nature and complexity of the client's operations. The auditor should design tests of details to ensure that the level of control risk is appropriate and that the audit evidence supports this level of risk.\n\nB. Management\u2019s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently: This refers to the assertions made by the client's management about the existence and effectiveness of their internal controls. The auditor should design tests of details to ensure that the evidence supports these assertions.\n\nC. The effectiveness of internal controls: This refers to the auditor's responsibility to assess the effectiveness of the client's internal controls. The auditor should design tests of details to gather evidence on the effectiveness of the controls, and to determine whether the controls are operating as intended.\n\nD. The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level: This refers to the level of assurance the auditor has planned to obtain at the relevant assertion level. The auditor should design tests of details to ensure that the level of assurance is appropriate and that the evidence supports this level of assurance.\n\nIn summary, an auditor of a nonissuer should design tests of details to ensure that sufficient audit evidence supports the planned level of control risk, management's assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently, the effectiveness of internal controls, and the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.",
