            "content": "The rotational kinetic energy of a uniform solid disk rolling down an inclined plane without slipping is constant. This is because the disk's rotational kinetic energy is only dependent on its moment of inertia, which is a property of the disk's shape and not affected by its velocity or acceleration.\n\nSince the disk starts from rest, its total kinetic energy is initially 0. As it rolls down the inclined plane, its translational kinetic energy increases due to its velocity, but its rotational kinetic energy remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is 1 (since the rotational kinetic energy is constant and the total kinetic energy increases).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1/4",
