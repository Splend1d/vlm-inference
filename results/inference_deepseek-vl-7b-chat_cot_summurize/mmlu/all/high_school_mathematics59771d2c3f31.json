The probability of rolling a multiple of 3 on a fair regular octahedral die is 4/8 = 1/2, since there are 4 numbers (3, 6, 9, 12) out of 8 that are multiples of 3.\n\nThe probability of rolling a multiple of 3 on a fair six-sided die is 1/6, since all numbers from 3 to 6 are multiples of 3.\n\nSince the rolls are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities to find the probability that both rolls are multiples of 3.\n\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12\n\nHowever, this probability is not given in the options.
