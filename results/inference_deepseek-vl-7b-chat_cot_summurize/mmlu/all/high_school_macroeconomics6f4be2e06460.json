This can lead to a decrease in production costs, allowing businesses to offer lower prices while still maintaining or increasing their profits. Additionally, the improved technology can lead to higher output and economic growth.\n\nA. stagflation is a situation where there is both high inflation and high unemployment, which is not the case here as prices are falling and real GDP is rising.\n\nC. an increase in government spending could potentially lead to higher inflation, not falling prices.\n\nD. a decrease in government spending could potentially lead to a decrease in economic growth, not an increase.",
