The balanced equation is:\n\nC2H4 + 2O2 \u2192 2CO2 + 2H2O\n\nNow, we can use the atomic weights to find the number of grams of each product:\n\n- Carbon dioxide (CO2) has an atomic weight of 44 amu (12 amu x 2).\n- Water (H2O) has an atomic weight of 18 amu (1 amu x 2).\n\nGiven that 84g of ethane was used, we can calculate the amount of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n84g (ethane) + 2 * 44g (CO2) = 84g + 88g = 172g\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 156g",
