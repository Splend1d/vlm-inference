At trial, after briefing from both parties, the court permitted the jury to hear testimony that there had been several previous accidents in the same building. The jury found for the student, and the university appealed. One of the university's arguments on appeal is that the testimony about the previous accidents should have been excluded as irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Which standard of review applies to this argument?\n\nA. Abuse of discretion.\nB. Clearly erroneous.\nC. De novo.\nD. Harmless error.\n",
