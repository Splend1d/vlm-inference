            "content": "The poem describes a colonial attitude toward the native peoples who were under the rule or influence of the British Empire. The poem suggests that the native peoples are in need of the \"civilized\" British to help them, and that the British have a \"burden\" to do so. This attitude is reflected in the lines \"Take up the White Man's burden\u2014/Send forth the best ye breed\u2014/Go bind your sons to exile/To serve your captives' need;\" and \"Take up the White Man's burden\u2014/The savage wars of peace\u2014/Fill full the mouth of Famine/And bid the sickness cease;\".\n\nThe poem also suggests that the native peoples are \"sullen\" and \"half-devil and half-child\", implying that they are not fully capable of self-rule or self-governance, and that they need the guidance and leadership of the British. This attitude is reflected in the lines \"Your new-caught, sullen peoples,/Half-devil and half-child;\" and \"Watch sloth and heathen Folly/Bring all your hopes to naught.\".\n\nTherefore, the poem describes a colonial attitude toward the native peoples who were under the rule or influence of the British Empire, which is best represented by option D.",
