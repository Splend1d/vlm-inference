Each species possesses a specialized adaptation for obtaining food. Why is it that similar adaptations do not exist among the finches of the South American mainland, the presumed origin of the Gal\u00e1pagos finch ancestor?\n\nA. The various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nB. South American predators limited evolution of the mainland finch.\nC. Reproductive isolation is not possible on the mainland.\nD. The available niches that the Darwin's finches exploited on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were already occupied by other species of birds on the mainland.\n",
