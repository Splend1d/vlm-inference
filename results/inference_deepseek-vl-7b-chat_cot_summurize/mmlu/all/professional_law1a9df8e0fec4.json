            "content": "Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.\nB. granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.\nC. denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.\nD. denied, because the landlord had the apparent authority to authorize the search of the husband's apartment.\n",

            "content": "The husband's motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison should be denied. The reason for this is that the exclusionary rule, which prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence in court, has not been extended to grand jury hearings. The exclusionary rule is a doctrine that prevents the admission of evidence obtained in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. In this case, the police did not have a warrant to search the husband's apartment, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, the exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings, as stated in the Supreme Court case of Illinois v. Rodriguez. Therefore, the husband's motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison should be denied.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The warrantless search of the husband's apartment was not unconstitutional. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the Supreme Court has recognized that there are exceptions to this rule, such as exigent circumstances or consent. In this case, the police had probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and that the husband was involved, which would justify a warrantless search.\n\nB. The grand jury is not barred from considering illegally obtained evidence. The exclusionary rule only applies to the trial court, not the grand jury. The grand jury's role is to determine whether there is enough evidence to indict a defendant, and it is not bound by the exclusionary rule.\n\nD. The landlord did not have the apparent authority to authorize the search of the husband's apartment. The Fourth Amendment requires a warrant to search a person's home, and the landlord's consent does not override this requirement. The landlord's consent to the search was not voluntary, as the police threatened to evict him if he did not cooperate.",
