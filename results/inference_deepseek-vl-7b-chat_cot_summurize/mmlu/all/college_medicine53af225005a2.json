When DFP binds to ACE, the ACE enzyme is rendered permanently inactive. This makes DFP a potent toxin, with lethal amounts at less than 100 mg. The interaction between DFP and ACE can best be characterized as:\n\nA. Competitive inhibition\nB. Noncompetitive inhibition\nC. Irreversible inhibition\nD. Partially competitive inhibition\n",
