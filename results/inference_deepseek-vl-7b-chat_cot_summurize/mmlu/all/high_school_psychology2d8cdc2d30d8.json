            "content": "The superintendent of a large school district asks the school psychologist to predict students' grade point averages (GPAs) for the first year of high school. The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?\n\nA. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores\nB. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\nC. The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score\nD. The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA\n",

            "content": "The school psychologist's main concern should be the degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA. This is because the multiple correlation is a measure of the overall predictive power of the model, taking into account the correlation of all predictor variables. If the school interest inventory score significantly increases the multiple correlation, it may significantly improve the accuracy of the predictions, which is the ultimate goal of the regression analysis.\n\nThe other options are less relevant:\n\nA. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores is important, but it is already included in the model as a predictor variable. The school psychologist should be more concerned with the additional predictive power that the school interest inventory score could provide.\n\nC. The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score is not directly relevant to the predictive power of the model. The zero-order correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables, but the regression analysis is a more complex model that takes into account the interaction between predictor variables.\n\nD. The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA is not directly relevant to the predictive power of the model. The school psychologist should be more concerned with the overall predictive power of the model, not the relative predictive power of different predictor variables.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA.",
