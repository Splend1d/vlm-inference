            "content": "Statement 1: Suppose f : [a, b] is a function and suppose f has a local maximum. f'(x) must exist and equal 0?\n\nThis statement is false. A local maximum of a function f on the interval [a, b] does not necessarily imply that the derivative f'(x) exists and equals 0. The derivative of a function can exist and equal 0 at a local maximum, but it is not a necessary condition. For example, consider the function f(x) = x^3 on the interval [0, 1]. It has a local maximum at x = 1, but the derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 exists and equals 0 at x = 1.\n\nStatement 2: There exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q.\n\nThis statement is true. There are many examples of non-constant continuous maps from the real numbers to the rational numbers. For example, the function f(x) = x^2 is a continuous map from the real numbers to the rational numbers, and it is non-constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. True, False.",
