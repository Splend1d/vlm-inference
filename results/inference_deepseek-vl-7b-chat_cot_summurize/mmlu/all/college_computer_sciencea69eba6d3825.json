A hash function has been applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true. To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined. Which of the following is (are) correct?\nI. true means the word was in the dictionary.\nII. false means the word was not in the dictionary.\nIII. Hash table size should increase with document size.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. I and II only\nD. II and III only\n",

In the given program, when a word is added to the hash table, the corresponding entry is set to true. So, if a word is found in the hash table, the entry for that word is true, indicating that the word is in the dictionary.\n\nII. false means the word was not in the dictionary. This is also correct. If a word is not found in the hash table, the corresponding entry is still false, indicating that the word is not in the dictionary.\n\nIII. Hash table size should increase with document size. This is not necessarily correct. The size of the hash table does not necessarily increase with the size of the document. The size of the hash table is determined by the number of unique words in the dictionary, not by the size of the document.\n\nIV. Hash table size should increase with document size. This is not correct. As mentioned above, the size of the hash table is determined by the number of unique words in the dictionary, not by the size of the document.",
