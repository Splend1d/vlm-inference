However, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-18) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). The factors of -18 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16, \u00b19, and \u00b118. The factors of 1 are \u00b11.
