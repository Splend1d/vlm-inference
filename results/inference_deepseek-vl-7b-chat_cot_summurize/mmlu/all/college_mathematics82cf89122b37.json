This means that the gradient is orthogonal to the constraint surface.\n\nThe normal vector of the constraint surface is (1, 0, 2), and the gradient of the function is (1, 0, 4). To find the point where they are orthogonal, we can set their dot product equal to zero:\n\n1 * 1 + 0 * 0 + 4 * 2 = 1 + 0 + 8 = 9 = 0.\n\nThis means that the gradient is orthogonal to the constraint surface at the point (0, 0, 2).\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of the function f(x, y, z) = x + 4z at the point (0, 0, 2). Substituting x = 0 and z = 2 into the function, we get:\n\nf(0, 0, 2) = 0 + 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression x + 4z is 8.\n\nComparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0",
