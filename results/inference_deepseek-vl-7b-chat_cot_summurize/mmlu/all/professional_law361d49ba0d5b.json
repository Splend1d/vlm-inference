However, the witness made a different statement in an affidavit, which the defendant's attorney tried to introduce as evidence. The trial judge should rule this inadmissible because the defendant's attorney failed to question the witness about the affidavit while the witness was still on the stand. This is because the witness's testimony on the stand should be considered as the most recent and reliable evidence of the incident's date.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. admissible as substantive evidence: This would allow the affidavit to be considered as substantive evidence, which contradicts the principle that a witness's testimony should be considered as the most reliable evidence.\n\nB. admissible for impeachment purposes only: This would limit the use of the affidavit to only impeaching the witness's credibility, which does not address the issue of the conflicting dates.\n\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception: This would rule the affidavit inadmissible based on hearsay rules, which is not the main issue in this scenario. The main issue is the defendant's attorney's failure to question the witness about the affidavit while on the stand.",
