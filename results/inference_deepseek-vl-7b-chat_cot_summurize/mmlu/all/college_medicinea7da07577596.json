            "content": "The volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas. This means that if the pressure is doubled, the volume will be halved, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the gas occupies 0.1L at 200atm. To find its volume at 1atm, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = Pressure \u00d7 Volume\n\nWe know the pressure at 1atm is 1/200 of the pressure at 200atm:\n\n1/200 = 1/200 \u00d7 Volume\n\nNow, we can solve for the volume:\n\nVolume = 1/200 \u00d7 0.1L\n\nVolume = 0.0005L\n\nSince 0.0005L is equal to 0.0005 \u00d7 1000 = 5L, the volume of the gas at 1atm will be slightly more than 20L.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. slightly more than 20L.",
