The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point.\n\nA. CH3CH2CH2CH3 (ethene) - This molecule has a double bond between two carbon atoms, which increases the attractive forces between the molecules. This results in a higher boiling point compared to the other molecules.\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (ethanol) - This molecule has a hydroxyl group (-OH) which increases the attractive forces between the molecules due to hydrogen bonding. This also results in a higher boiling point compared to the other molecules.\n\nC. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl (ethene chloride) - This molecule has a double bond between two carbon atoms, but it also has a chlorine atom attached. The chlorine atom can cause electron withdrawing effects, which can decrease the attractive forces between the molecules. This results in a lower boiling point compared to the other molecules.\n\nD. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (ethene bromide) - This molecule has a double bond between two carbon atoms, but it also has a bromine atom attached. The bromine atom can cause electron withdrawing effects, which can decrease the attractive forces between the molecules. This results in a lower boiling point compared to the other molecules.\n\nBased on the intermolecular forces present in each molecule, the expected normal boiling point in increasing order is:\n\n1. CH3CH2CH2CH3 (ethene)\n2. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (ethanol)\n3. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl (ethene chloride)\n4. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (ethene bromide)",
