Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nThe language of this passage by Susan B.

The passage discusses the interconnectedness of different communities and states, and the idea that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. It also emphasizes the importance of not living with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea and the recognition that anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. These ideas are closely related to the fight for voting rights and the struggle for social justice that was a significant part of the civil rights movement in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Debates over voting rights.",
