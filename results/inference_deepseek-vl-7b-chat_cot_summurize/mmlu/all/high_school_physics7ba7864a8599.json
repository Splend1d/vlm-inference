            "content": "A. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n\nIn a cyclic process of an ideal gas, the change in internal energy (\u0394U) is equal to the work done (W) during the isobaric step. This is because the work done during the isobaric step is equal to the pressure times the area change (\u0394P * \u0394A) which is equal to the change in internal energy (\u0394U).\n\nB. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The work done during the isobaric step is equal to the change in internal energy (\u0394U), as explained in option A. The work done during the isothermal step is equal to the heat transfer (Q) into the system, which is not necessarily equal to the change in internal energy (\u0394U).\n\nC. The total work done during the cycle is positive.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The total work done during the cycle depends on the specific process and the conditions of the system. In some cases, the total work done may be negative, which means that the system absorbs energy from its surroundings.\n\nD. The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The total work done during the cycle is equal to the change in internal energy (\u0394U), as explained in option A. The net amount of heat transferred (Q) depends on the specific process and the conditions of the system. In some cases, the net amount of heat transferred may be negative, which means that the system loses energy to its surroundings.",
