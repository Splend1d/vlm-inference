One of these conditions is that the loop gain should be less than unity. This means that the gain of the feedback system should not be greater than 1, otherwise the system will not oscillate.\n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\nA. Loop gain should be unity: This is not a correct criterion for oscillatory behavior. As mentioned above, the loop gain should be less than unity for oscillation to occur.\n\nC. The phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0: This is not a correct criterion for oscillatory behavior. The phase of the feedback signal does not directly affect whether the system will oscillate or not.\n\nD. Both A and C: This option is incorrect because both A and C are not correct criteria for oscillatory behavior.",
