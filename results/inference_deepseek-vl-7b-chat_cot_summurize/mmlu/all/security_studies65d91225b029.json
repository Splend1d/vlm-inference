The Ideal Policy framework provides the analytical tools for understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, for example why a policymaker takes the decision to, or not to, implement the Ideal Policy.\nB. The Ideal Policy framework focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.\nC. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy.\nD. The Ideal Policy framework recognizes that to make non-compliance too costly, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary or to deny the targets objectives. The condition for success is pivotal on the coercer's threat of force.\n",

The Ideal Policy framework provides the analytical tools for understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, for example why a policymaker takes the decision to, or not to, implement the Ideal Policy.\n\nThe Ideal Policy framework is a useful analytical tool for practitioners because it allows them to understand the contextual factors that influence the use of coercive diplomacy. This includes understanding the decision-making process of policymakers and the factors that influence their decisions to implement or not implement the Ideal Policy. This understanding can help practitioners to better anticipate and respond to the actions of policymakers and to develop strategies that are more likely to be successful.\n\nB. The Ideal Policy framework focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.\n\nThe Ideal Policy framework is useful for practitioners because it provides a clear and concise explanation of the conditions under which the Ideal Policy is likely to be successful. This includes the actions that the coercer must take in order to achieve their objectives and the conditions under which the coercer's actions are likely to be effective. This understanding can help practitioners to develop strategies that are more likely to be successful and to anticipate the actions of the coercer.\n\nC. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy.\n\nThe Ideal Policy framework is useful for practitioners because it provides a comprehensive and flexible framework for examining the contextual factors that influence the use of coercive diplomacy. This includes the potential causal conditions that may influence the success of the Ideal Policy and the contextual factors that may affect the effectiveness of these conditions. This understanding can help practitioners to develop strategies that are more likely to be successful and to anticipate the actions of the coercer.\n\nD. The Ideal Policy framework recognizes that to make non-compliance too costly, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary or to deny the targets objectives. The condition for success is pivotal on the coercer's threat of force.\n\nThe Ideal Policy framework is useful for practitioners because it provides a clear understanding of the conditions that must be met in order for the Ideal Policy to be successful. This includes the need for the coercer to threaten to defeat the adversary or to deny the targets objectives in order to make non-compliance too costly. This understanding can help practitioners to develop strategies that are more likely to be successful and to anticipate the actions of the coercer.",
