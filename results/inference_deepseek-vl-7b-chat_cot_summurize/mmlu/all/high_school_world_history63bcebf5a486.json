That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan\n",

            "content": "The author's assertion in the passage is that Western Europe achieved global hegemony by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. This implies that the colonization of new lands and the exploitation of resources played a significant role in Western Europe's rise to global hegemony.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa: This option aligns with the author's assertion. The colonization of Africa allowed Western Europe to exploit its resources and expand its influence.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire: This option does not directly support the author's assertion. While the conquest of the Aztec Empire was a significant event, it was not a direct result of the \"quantum jump\" that the author refers to.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity: This option does not align with the author's assertion. While the reformation of Catholic Christianity was a significant event, it was not a direct result of the \"quantum jump\" that the author refers to.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan: This option does not align with the author's assertion. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan was a significant event, but it was not a direct result of the \"quantum jump\" that the author refers to.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A, the colonization of the interior of Africa, best supports the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.",
