The intersection of H and K, denoted by H intersection K, is the set of elements that are in both H and K. The order of the intersection of two subgroups is the product of the orders of the subgroups divided by the order of their intersection. This is a well-known result in group theory.\n\nStatement 2: A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nThis statement is also true. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order 2p (where p is an odd prime) is either cyclic (i.e., isomorphic to Z_p) or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p. This is because D_p has order 2p and is the only non-abelian group of order 2p.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A. True, True.",
