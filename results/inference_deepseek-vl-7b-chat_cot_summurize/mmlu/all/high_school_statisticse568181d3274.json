This can be calculated using the z-score formula for the 25th percentile:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere z is the z-score, X is the value we want to find, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, \u03bc = 45 g and \u03c3 = 4 g. We want to find the 25th percentile, which is 25% of the total masses. So, we need to find the value below which 25% of the masses fall.\n\n25% of the total masses is 0.25 * (45 g + 4 g) = 10.5 g.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the z-score formula:\n\nz = (10.5 g - 45 g) / 4 g\nz = -34.5 g / 4 g\nz = -8.625\n\nNow, we need to find the mass corresponding to this z-score. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the mass. The z-score of -8.625 corresponds to a mass of approximately 42.2 g.\n\nSo, the 25th percentile of the masses of all the eggs is approximately 42.2 g.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 42.2 g.",
