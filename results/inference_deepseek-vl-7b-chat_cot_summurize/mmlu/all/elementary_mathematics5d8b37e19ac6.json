There are approximately 30 days in a month.\n\nSince Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days, we can calculate how many boxes he uses in a month by dividing the number of days in a month by the number of days per box:\n\n30 days / 5 days per box = 6 boxes\n\nSo, Rob uses approximately 6 boxes of cat food per month.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 6 boxes.",
