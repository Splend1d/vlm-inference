            "content": "On May 19, a telephone operator for the local telephone company received a call in which a male voice said: \"I want to report that the downtown sporting arena is going to be blown up tonight. \" The caller then hung up. The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.\nB. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.\nC. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\nD. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.\n",
