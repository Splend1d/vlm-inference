The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth?\n\nA. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires\nB. The development of joint-stock companies\nC. The importation of food crops from the New World\nD. The African slave trade\n",

            "content": "The instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth were most inspired by the African slave trade. This is because the Mahatma Gandhi's message was written during the Indian Independence Movement, and the African slave trade was a major factor in the economic and social decline of India during this period. The slave trade led to a decrease in the availability of skilled labor, which in turn led to a decline in the Indian textile industry. This made it difficult for Indian artisans to compete with foreign cloth, and inspired Gandhi to call for a boycott of foreign cloth in order to support the Indian textile industry.",
