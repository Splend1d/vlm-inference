            "content": "Among those hurt by inflation are I. borrowers at fixed interest rates and II. individuals on fixed incomes. \n\nInflation can affect borrowers at fixed interest rates because the fixed interest rate they are paying may not keep up with the rising prices of goods and services. This can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of their fixed income, making it harder for them to afford their loan payments.\n\nInflation can also affect individuals on fixed incomes, such as retirees or those receiving social security benefits, because the fixed amount of money they receive may not cover the increased cost of living. This can lead to a decrease in their standard of living and an increased need for financial assistance.\n\nInflation can also affect those with savings earning fixed interest rates, as the fixed interest rate on their savings may not keep up with the rising prices of goods and services. This can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of their savings, making it harder for them to afford the things they need.\n\nInflation can also affect restaurant owners, as the rising prices of goods and services can lead to increased costs for them, which they may need to pass on to their customers in the form of higher menu prices. This can lead to decreased customer demand and a decrease in sales, which can make it harder for them to stay in business.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. I and II only.",
