The defendant lifted the victim's shirt, and the victim gently pushed the defendant's hand away and then left the couch to make coffee. While the victim was making coffee, the defendant picked up her solid gold ring that she had carelessly left on the living room table. Intending to give it back to her with a diamond in it, he put it into his pocket and got ready to leave. Before the defendant went home, he stopped into a bar. There he met a patron who offered to sell him a two-month-old plasma TV for $200. The patron said that he would take only cash and that he also had some unboxed silverware and jewehy he could sell the defendant from his van, which was parked outside. The patron said, \"You better decide fast, because I've got to get out of town right away. \" The defendant, who knew that the TV was worth $1,000, gave the patron $200, and the patron gave the defendant the TV, which was not in a box. The patron did not tell the defendant he had just stolen the television from a house down the street.

This act of taking the ring without the victim's consent or knowledge constitutes larceny. \n\nHowever, the defendant's crime becomes more serious when we consider the fact that he received the ring from the patron who had just stolen it. The patron did not inform the defendant that the TV was stolen, and the defendant did not know about the stolen nature of the TV when he bought it. Therefore, the defendant is not guilty of embezzlement. \n\nThe defendant's act of giving the patron $200 for the TV does not constitute battery upon the victim, as there is no evidence of physical harm or threat. \n\nTherefore, the defendant should be convicted of receiving stolen property, which is option D.",
