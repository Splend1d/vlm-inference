The detective, who questioned the defendant at the station house after his arrest, testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence. The detective further testified that when given the opportunity to take a lie detector test, the defendant refused. The defendant's attorney did not object to the detective's testimony. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to prison. The defendant, who is now represented by a new attorney, appeals, claiming that it was error to admit the detective's testimony. The appellate court should find\n\nA. plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.\nB. plain error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.\nD. harmless error, because the defendant's statements were admissions.\n",

            "content": "The defendant's attorney did not object to the detective's testimony, which means that the defendant's attorney did not raise any objections to the admissibility of the detective's testimony. Therefore, the defendant's attorney did not preserve the argument that the admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nSince the defendant's attorney did not preserve the argument, the appellate court should find that the admission of the detective's testimony was harmless error. This is because the defendant's attorney had the opportunity to object to the testimony, but failed to do so. Therefore, the defendant cannot now claim that the admission of the detective's testimony violated his privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.",
