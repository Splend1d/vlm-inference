Let's denote the empirical formula as CxHyOz, where x, y, and z represent the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, respectively.\n\nThe mass of the compound is the sum of the masses of its individual atoms:\n\n18.02 g (carbon) + 3.03 g (hydrogen) + 29.05 g (oxygen) = 49.08 g\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible integer values for x, y, and z such that:\n\n1. x + y + z = 49 (the total number of atoms)\n2. The sum of the coefficients of x, y, and z in the empirical formula is equal to the sum of the coefficients of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the compound's chemical formula.\n\nThe chemical formula of the compound is C3H6O3. The sum of the coefficients of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is 3 + 6 + 3 = 12.\n\nSince the sum of the coefficients of x, y, and z in the empirical formula is 49, we can set up the following equations:\n\nx = 12 (since x + y + z = 49)\ny = 12 (since x + y + z = 49)\nz = 15 (since x + y + z = 49)\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is C12H18O15, which is not listed in the given options. This means that the given information is not sufficient to determine the empirical formula of the compound.",
