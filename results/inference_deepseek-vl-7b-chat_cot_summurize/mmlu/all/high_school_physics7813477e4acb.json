            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of capacitance and charge. The capacitance of a capacitor is directly proportional to its area and inversely proportional to its distance from the charged object. In this case, the area of the capacitor is the same, but the distance from the charged object is three times smaller (since the capacitors are in series).\n\nLet's denote the capacitance of each capacitor as C1, C2, and C3. We know that the total capacitance of the three capacitors in series is 3 * 18 = 54 \u03bcF.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the total charge stored in a series of capacitors:\n\nQ = \u03a3(C * V)\n\nwhere Q is the total charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage across the capacitors.\n\nSince the capacitors are fully charged, the voltage across them is equal to the voltage of the battery, which is 1.5 V (1.5 V * 2 \u03bcF = 3 C).\n\nNow, we can find the total charge stored in the three capacitors:\n\nQ = 54 * 1.5 = 81 C\n\nSince each capacitor has the same capacitance, we can find the charge stored on each capacitor:\n\nQ = C * V\n\nQ1 = C1 * 1.5 = 1.5 * 2 = 3 C\nQ2 = Q1 = 3 C\nQ3 = Q1 = 3 C\n\nSo, the charge stored on each capacitor is 3 C, which is equal to 1800 \u03bcC (3 * 1800 \u03bcC = 5400 \u03bcC).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1800 \u03bcC.",
