The molar mass of propane is approximately 44.1 g/mol.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of moles:\n\nMoles = 6.2 g / 44.1 g/mol\n\nMoles = 0.141 mol\n\nHowever, this result is not in the given options. There might be a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided. Please double-check the problem and options.",
