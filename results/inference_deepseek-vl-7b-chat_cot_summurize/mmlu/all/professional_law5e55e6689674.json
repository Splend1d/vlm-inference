This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n",

            "content": "A. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nThe supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution states that federal laws are supreme over state laws, and any state law that conflicts with a federal law is considered invalid. In this case, Congress has enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende, which directly conflicts with the state's power to tax. Therefore, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely invalid because of the supremacy clause.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole: This option is incorrect because the general welfare power of Congress is not applicable in this situation. The general welfare power allows Congress to regulate activities that affect the health, safety, and general welfare of the nation. The federal law in question is specifically designed to prevent a state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende, which is considered vital to the economy of the entire country.\n\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state: This option is incorrect because the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution allows Congress to override state laws when necessary. In this case, Congress has enacted a statute that directly conflicts with the state's power to tax, which is considered a violation of the supremacy clause.\n\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states: This option is incorrect because the federal law in question does not place one state on an unequal footing with other states. The law affects only the state in question, and does not impose any additional burdens on other states.",
