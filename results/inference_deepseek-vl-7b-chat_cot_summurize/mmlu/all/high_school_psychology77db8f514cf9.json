No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.\n\nThe correct answer is C. At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified. This is because the dentist's research only shows a correlation between brushing teeth after lunch and a lower number of cavities. It does not prove that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. Therefore, the writer's statement is not justified even if 100 patients brushed their teeth after lunch.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
