            "content": "Let's denote the probability of a dog having heartworm as P(H), the probability of a dog not having heartworm as P(~H), and the probability of a dog testing positive as P(T|H). We are given:\n\nP(T|H) = 0.96 (positive result in 96% of dogs with heartworm)\nP(~H) = 0.98 (negative result in 98% of dogs without heartworm)\nP(H) = 0.1 (heartworm occurs in 10% of dogs)\n\nWe want to find P(T|H), the probability that a dog testing positive actually has heartworm.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we have:\n\nP(H|T) = P(T|H) * P(H) / [P(T|H) * P(H) + P(~H) * (1 - P(H))]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP(H|T) = (0.96 * 0.1) / [(0.96 * 0.1) + (0.98 * (1 - 0.1))]\n\nP(H|T) = 0.096 / (0.96 + 0.98 - 0.96 * 0.98)\n\nP(H|T) = 0.096 / (0.96 + 0.98 - 0.96 * 0.98)\n\nP(H|T) = 0.096 / (0.96 + 0.98 - 0.96 * 0.98)\n\nP(H|T) = 0.096 / (0.96 + 0.98 - 0.96 * 0.98)\n\nP(H|T) = 0.096 / (0.96 + 0.98 - 0.96 * 0.98)\n\nP(H|T) \u2248 0.18\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive for heartworm actually has heartworm is approximately 18%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
