            "content": "Let's denote the current computer's speed as S and its price as P.\n\nAccording to the problem, five years ago, the computer worked half as fast as the current one, so its speed was S/2 and its price was 2P.\n\nThe speed to price ratio for the older computer is (S/2) / (2P) = S/4P.\n\nThe current computer's speed to price ratio is S / P.\n\nWe want to find the percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio compared to the current one, so we need to find the ratio of the two speed to price ratios: (S/4P) / (S/P).\n\nThis simplifies to 1/4, so the current computer's speed to price ratio is 1/4 of the older computer's speed to price ratio.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
