On August 1, the widower handed his friend a deed conveying the quarry to his niece and said to the friend, \"Give this to my niece. \" Unknown to the widower, the niece was in Africa. The next week, the friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. One month later, the widower died, and in his will he devised the quarry to his daughter. Thereafter, the niece returned from Africa, and a dispute arose between the niece and the daughter regarding ownership of the quarry.

            "content": "The question presents a scenario where a widower conveys his quarry to his niece, but the niece is not present to receive the deed. The widower dies before the deed is recorded, and his daughter is later bequeathed the quarry in his will. The niece returns and disputes the daughter's claim to the quarry. The court rules in favor of the niece.\n\nThe key to understanding this case is the concept of \"causa mortis\" gift. A causa mortis gift is a gift made in contemplation of death, which is effective upon the death of the donor. In this case, the widower's conveyance of the quarry to his niece was made in contemplation of his own death, as he was a widower. Therefore, the conveyance was effective upon his death, even though the deed was not physically delivered to the niece.\n\nThe court's ruling in favor of the niece is most likely based on the fact that the conveyance was effective upon the death of the widower, as it was a causa mortis gift. The delivery of the deed to the friend and the recording of the deed with the Recorder's Office did not affect the effectiveness of the gift, as it was already effective upon the death of the widower.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
