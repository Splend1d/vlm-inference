The Qur'anic verse talks about avoiding certain things for success, while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse talks about enjoying life and pouring wine when the roses are in bloom.\n\nThe question then asks which of the given conclusions would be best supported by this comparison. \n\nOption A, \"Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era,\" is not supported by the comparison. The Qur'anic verse is about avoiding certain things for success, which does not indicate atheism.\n\nOption B, \"Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims,\" is not supported by the comparison. The Qur'anic verse is about avoiding certain things, which could be seen as a religious restriction.\n\nOption C, \"Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations,\" is not supported by the comparison. The verses do not provide any information about missionary activity or conversions.\n\nOption D, \"Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice,\" is supported by the comparison. The Qur'anic verse is about avoiding certain things, which could be seen as a rejection of certain practices. The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse is about enjoying life and pouring wine, which could be seen as a rejection of religious restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
