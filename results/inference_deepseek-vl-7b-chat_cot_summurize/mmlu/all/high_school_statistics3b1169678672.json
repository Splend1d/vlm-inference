Therefore, a smaller sample size will result in a larger margin of error. \n\nA smaller confidence level (option I) will also result in a smaller margin of error, because it will result in a narrower confidence interval. \n\nA smaller sample standard deviation (option II) will also result in a smaller margin of error, because it will result in a smaller standard error.\n\nSo, options II and III will both result in a smaller margin of error. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
