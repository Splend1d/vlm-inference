Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nEnergy expenditure = 3.0 \u00d7 10^3 l/min \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1.33 \u00d7 10^6 kJ/l\n\nEnergy expenditure = 150 \u00d7 1.33 \u00d7 10^6 kJ\n\nEnergy expenditure \u2248 200 \u00d7 10^6 kJ\n\nEnergy expenditure \u2248 200,000,000 kJ\n\nSo, the athlete expends approximately 200,000,000 kJ of energy. However, this is not an exact match for the options provided. The closest option is:\n\nB. 150 kJ",
