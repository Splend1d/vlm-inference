K+ (Potassium ion): The atomic radius of K+ is approximately 1.3 \u00c5 (angstroms).\n\nB. Ca2+ (Calcium ion): The atomic radius of Ca2+ is approximately 1.9 \u00c5.\n\nC. Sc3+ (Tin(IV) ion): The atomic radius of Sc3+ is approximately 1.4 \u00c5.\n\nD. Rb+ (Rubidium ion): The atomic radius of Rb+ is approximately 1.5 \u00c5.\n\nComparing the atomic radii, we can see that the Sc3+ ion has the smallest radius with an atomic radius of approximately 1.4 \u00c5. Therefore, the answer is C. Sc3+.",
