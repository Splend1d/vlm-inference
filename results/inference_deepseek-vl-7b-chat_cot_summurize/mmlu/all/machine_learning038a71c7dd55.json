The kernel density estimator and kernel regression are two different statistical methods. The kernel density estimator is used to estimate the probability density function of a random variable, while kernel regression is used to estimate the relationship between a response variable and one or more predictor variables. The value Yi = 1/n in kernel regression does not apply to the kernel density estimator.\n\nStatement 2: The depth of a learned decision tree can be larger than the number of training examples used to create the tree.\n\nThis statement is true. In decision tree learning, the depth of a tree refers to the maximum number of levels the tree can have. The number of training examples used to create the tree is not necessarily the same as the depth of the tree. The depth of the tree can be larger than the number of training examples if the tree is allowed to grow deeper in order to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
