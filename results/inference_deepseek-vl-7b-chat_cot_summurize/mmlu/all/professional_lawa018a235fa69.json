The following day, the gardener conveys the property to a landscaper; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the gardener executes an identical conveyance of the orchard to a friend. The friend gives the gardener a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper. The landscaper, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to an investor, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the investor purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper and duly records the deed. Suppose that the jurisdiction in which the property is located has a pure race statute as their deed recordation law. Under these circumstances, which of the aforementioned parties would ultimately prevail?\n\nA. The investor.\nB. The landscaper.\nC. The friend.\nD. The gardener.\n",
