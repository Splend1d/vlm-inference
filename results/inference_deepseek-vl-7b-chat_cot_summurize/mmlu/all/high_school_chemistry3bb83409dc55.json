They are completely independent of each other; temperature has no effect on entropy.\nB. There is a direct relationship, because at higher temperatures there is an increase in energy dispersal.\nC. There is an inverse relationship, because at higher temperatures substances are more likely to be in a gaseous state.\nD. It depends on the specific gas and the strength of the intermolecular forces between individual molecules.\n",
