A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective\u2014a new world order\u2014can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace.

            "content": "President George Herbert Walker Bush's \"new world order\" refers to a vision of a more peaceful, secure, and just world where nations, regardless of their geographical location, can prosper and live in harmony. This vision is most directly related to the concept of a \"new world order\" as proposed by Woodrow Wilson in his Fourteen Points, which was a plan for peace after World War I. The Fourteen Points were a set of principles that Wilson proposed to the world, including self-determination, national self-government, and the abolition of secret treaties and secret societies.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine, which was proposed by President James Monroe in 1823, was a policy that stated that the United States would not tolerate European interference in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere. The \"Big Stick\" policy, which was proposed by President Theodore Roosevelt, was a policy of using force to maintain peace and order in the world. The Containment policy toward the Soviet Union, which was proposed by President Harry S. Truman, was a policy of containing the spread of communism by the Soviet Union.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points.",
