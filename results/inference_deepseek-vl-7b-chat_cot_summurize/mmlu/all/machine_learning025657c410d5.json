The log-likelihood of the data may increase, but it does not always do so. The E-M algorithm aims to maximize the log-likelihood, but it does not guarantee that the log-likelihood will increase in every iteration. The algorithm may converge to a local maximum, and it may not always find the global maximum.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nThis statement is true. One of the main disadvantages of Q-learning is that it requires the learner to have prior knowledge of the environment. This is because Q-learning uses a value function to estimate the expected future rewards for each possible action. If the learner does not have any prior knowledge of the environment, it cannot accurately estimate the value function, and Q-learning will not work effectively.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
