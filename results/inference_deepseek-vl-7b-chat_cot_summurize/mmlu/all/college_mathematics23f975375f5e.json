Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a(1^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\nx = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a9) / 2\nx = (-1 \u00b1 3) / 2\n\nSo, we have two solutions: x = -2 and x = 1. However, since the equation is defined in the interval [0, 1], only one of these solutions is valid. Therefore, k = 1 and n = 0.\n\nThe correct answer is B.",
