            "content": "A father lived with his son, who was an alcoholic. When drunk, the son often became violent and physically abused his father. As a result, the father always lived in fear. One night, the father heard his son on the front stoop making loud obscene remarks. The father was certain that his son was drunk and was terrified that he would be physically beaten again. In his fear, he bolted the front door and took out a revolver. When the son discovered that the door was bolted, he kicked it down. As the son burst through the front door, his father shot him four times in the chest, killing him. In fact, the son was not under the influence of alcohol or any drug and did not intend to harm his father. At trial, the father presented the above facts and asked the judge to instruct the jury on self-defense. How should the judge instruct the jury with respect to self-defense?\n\nA. Give the self-defense instruction, because it expresses the defense\u00d5s theory of the case.\nB. Give the self-defense instruction, because the evi-dence is sufficient to raise the defense.\nC. Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father was not in imminent danger from his son.\nD. Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father used excessive force.\n",

Give the self-defense instruction, because it expresses the defense's theory of the case.\n\nThe father's defense is that he acted in self-defense, believing his son was about to attack him. The judge should instruct the jury on this theory, as it is the basis of the father's defense. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Give the self-defense instruction, because the evidence is sufficient to raise the defense.\nThis option is incorrect because the evidence does not support the father's claim of self-defense. The father shot his son after he kicked down the door, which indicates that the father was not in immediate danger and had time to assess the situation.\n\nC. Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father was not in imminent danger from his son.\nThis option is incorrect because the father's fear and actions suggest that he believed his son was about to attack him, which is a reasonable basis for a self-defense claim.\n\nD. Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father used excessive force.\nThis option is incorrect because the father's use of force was proportionate to the perceived threat. He shot his son four times in the chest, which could be considered excessive force, but the question is whether the father was in imminent danger, which is not clearly established in the facts provided.",
