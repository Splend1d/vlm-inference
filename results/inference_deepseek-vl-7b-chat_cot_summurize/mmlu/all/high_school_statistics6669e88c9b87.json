            "content": "A. A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to use systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA (Automobile Association of America) members in the city.\n\nThis statement is true. Systematic sampling is a method of selecting observations from a larger population by using a fixed, non-random interval or order. In this case, the larger population would be all AAA members in the city, and the interval or order would be to select every nth member. This method can be efficient and cost-effective, especially if the list of AAA members is already available.\n\nB. A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.\n\nThis statement is false. While random sampling can be a good method for obtaining a representative sample, it is not necessarily a time- and cost-saving procedure. Random sampling requires a large number of drivers to be included in the sample to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population. This can be time-consuming and expensive.\n\nC. To determine the mean number of years between accidents, randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is not important as long as the sample size is very large.\n\nThis statement is false. Randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is important for ensuring that the sample is representative of the entire population. Even if the sample size is very large, without randomness, there is a risk that the sample may not be representative of the entire population.\n\nD. None of the above are true statements.\n\nThis statement is false. While it is true that statement A is a true statement, statements B and C are also true statements.",
