The propositions are:\n\nD \u2261 E\nF \u2228 D\n~E \u00b7 ~F\n\nFirst, let's create the indirect truth table for the propositions:\n\n| D | E | F | ~E | ~F | D \u2261 E | F \u2228 D | ~E \u00b7 ~F |\n|---|---|---|----|----|-------|--------|-----------|\n| T | T | T | F   | F   | T      | T       | T         |\n| T | T | F | F   | T   | F      | T       | F         |\n| T | F | T | T   | F   | F      | T       | F         |\n| T | F | F | F   | T   | F      | T       | F         |\n| F | T | T | T   | F   | F      | T       | F         |\n| F | T | F | T   | T   | F      | T       | T         |\n| F | F | T | T   | T   | F      | T       | T         |\n| F | F | F | T   | T   | F      | T       | T         |\n\nNow, let's analyze the table to determine the consistency of the set of propositions:\n\n1. D \u2261 E:\n   - When D is true and E is true, the implication is true (T \u2192 T).\n   - When D is true and E is false, the implication is false (T \u2192 F).\n   - When D is false and E is true, the implication is false (F \u2192 T).\n   - When D is false and E is false, the implication is true (F \u2192 F).\n\n2. F \u2228 D:\n   - When F is true and D is true, the disjunction is true (T \u2228 T).\n   - When F is true and D is false, the disjunction is true (T \u2228 F).\n   - When F is false and D is true, the disjunction is true (F \u2228 T).\n   - When F is false and D is false, the disjunction is true (F \u2228 F).\n\n3. ~E \u00b7 ~F:\n   - When E is true and F is true, the double negation is true (~T \u00b7 ~T).\n   - When E is true and F is false, the double negation is true (~T \u00b7 T).\n   - When E is false and F is true, the double negation is true (~F \u00b7 ~T).\n   - When E is false and F is false, the double negation is true (~F \u00b7 F).\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the set of propositions is consistent. There are multiple consistent valuations for the propositions. One such valuation is when D, E, and F are true, resulting in the following truth assignments:\n\n- D = True\n- E = True\n- F = True\n\nThis valuation satisfies all the propositions in the set.",
