In a finite-dimensional real vector space, a linear transformation is invertible if and only if it is its own inverse. Therefore, P must be invertible.\n\nHowever, the statement II (P is diagonalizable) and III (P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation) cannot be determined from the given condition. A linear transformation is diagonalizable if and only if it is similar to a diagonal matrix. But the given condition only tells us that P is its own inverse, not that it is similar to a diagonal matrix.\n\nSimilarly, the statement III (P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation) cannot be determined from the given condition. The condition P^2 = P only tells us that P is its own inverse, not that it is the zero transformation.",
