            "content": "To determine the company's debt on December 31, year 2, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. The $1,000,000 line of credit: The company has drawn $250,000, so the remaining balance is $1,000,000 - $250,000 = $750,000.\n2. The $750,000 secured note: This is a long-term liability, so it should be included in the long-term liabilities.\n3. The $300,000 balloon note: This is a short-term liability, so it should be included in the current liabilities.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total debt:\n\nCurrent liabilities: $250,000 (line of credit) + $300,000 (balloon note) = $550,000\nLong-term liabilities: $750,000 (line of credit) + $750,000 (secured note) = $1,500,000\n\nThe company's debt should be presented as follows:\n\nA. Current liabilities of $550,000; long-term liabilities of $1,550,000\n\nOption B is incorrect because the balloon note is a short-term liability, not a long-term liability. Option C is incorrect because the balloon note is a short-term liability, not a long-term liability. Option D is incorrect because the balloon note is a short-term liability, not a long-term liability.",
