The restaurant's owner admitted that the chowder was not homemade, but even if it was, a reasonable inspection would not have discovered the pebble. Therefore, the customer can argue that the restaurant was negligent in providing a product that was not fit for its intended purpose, which is to be consumed without the risk of injury.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. recover, but only if the restaurant had received prior notice of the defective condition of the soup. This option is not applicable because the customer did not provide any prior notice of the defective condition of the soup.\n\nC. not recover, because a reasonable inspection of the soup would not have disclosed the existence of the pebble. This option is incorrect because the customer did not have to perform a reasonable inspection to determine the presence of the pebble. The restaurant's owner admitted that the chowder was not homemade, so the customer could reasonably expect that the soup was not fit for consumption.\n\nD. not recover, because the soup would not constitute an unreasonably dangerous product when it was served to the customer. This option is incorrect because the presence of a pebble in the soup is considered an unreasonably dangerous product, as it poses a risk of injury to the consumer.",
