Which of the following best describes what would occur if the intensity of this light were increased dramatically?\n\nA. Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons.\nB. Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.\nC. After several seconds, necessary for the electrons to absorb sufficient energy from the incident light, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.\nD. Nothing would happen.\n",
