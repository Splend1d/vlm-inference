Dashing to the car, the husband then drove his wife and ailing son to the nearest hospital. On the way to the hospital, the son had a seizure and stopped breathing. Seconds later, the car went out of control despite the husband's reasonable efforts, swinging across the center line into oncoming traffic, where it collided wit.

The husband's car went out of control and crossed the center line into oncoming traffic, which is a clear violation of the statute. Therefore, the driver has a strong case for the husband being strictly liable for the accident, as the husband's actions directly resulted in the collision.\n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\nB. prevail, because the statute was designed to protect motorists such as the driver. This option is not correct because the driver is not the one being protected by the statute; rather, the statute is meant to protect other motorists from vehicles traveling to the left of the center line.\n\nC. not prevail, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident. This option is not correct because there is no information provided about the driver having a last clear chance to avoid the accident.\n\nD. not prevail, because the husband was acting reasonably in an emergency. This option is not correct because the husband's actions were not reasonable in an emergency situation. Driving to the left of the center line and causing a collision is not a reasonable response to an emergency.",
