The flag has 13 alternating red and white stripes, representing the 13 original colonies, and a blue field with 50 white stars, representing the 50 states. The ratio of the width to the length is 13 to 26, which is equivalent to 10 to 19. Therefore, the correct dimensions for the American flag are 13 in. by 26 in.",
