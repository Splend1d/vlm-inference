            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, damaged suitcases) out of n trials (suitcases)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a suitcase being damaged, which is 5/25 = 1/5)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 25 suitcases)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 2 damaged suitcases)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(25, 2) * (1/5)^2 * (4/5)^(25-2)\n\nFirst, we calculate C(25, 2):\n\nC(25, 2) = 25! / (2! * (25-2)!)\nC(25, 2) = 25! / (2! * 23!)\nC(25, 2) = (25 * 24 * 23!)/(2! * 23!)\nC(25, 2) = (25 * 24)/(2 * 1)\nC(25, 2) = 300\n\nNow, we calculate the rest of the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 300 * (1/5)^2 * (4/5)^23\nP(X = 2) = 300 * (1/25) * (1/625)\nP(X = 2) = 300 * (1/625)\nP(X = 2) = 300/625\nP(X = 2) = 12/25\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged is 12/25.\n\nThe correct answer is D.",
