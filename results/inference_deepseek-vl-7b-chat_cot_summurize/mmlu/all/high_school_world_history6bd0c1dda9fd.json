It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following would most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA. The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers\nB. The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment\nC. The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n",

            "content": "The passage discusses the struggle against neo-colonialism and the role of non-alignment in this struggle. It mentions that foreign investment from capitalist countries should be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State, with its own interests in mind. This implies that the foreign investment should be used to benefit the non-aligned State, rather than being used to impoverish it or to establish control over it.\n\nOption A, \"The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers,\" does not align with the passage's discussion of preventing the financial power of developed countries from being used to impoverish less developed countries.\n\nOption B, \"The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment,\" is not directly mentioned or implied in the passage.\n\nOption C, \"The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism,\" is not directly mentioned or implied in the passage.\n\nOption D, \"The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies,\" aligns with the passage's discussion of preventing the financial power of developed countries from being used to impoverish less developed countries. If foreign investment is used to benefit the non-aligned State, it could potentially lead to a reduction in political instability and unrest in former colonies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies.",
