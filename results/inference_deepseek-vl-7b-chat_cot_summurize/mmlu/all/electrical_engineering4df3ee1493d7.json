            "content": "To find the range of firing angle control, we need to consider the phase difference between the input voltage and the load voltage. The input voltage is a single-phase one-pulse controlled voltage, which is a sine wave with a frequency of 314 rad/s (or 2\u03c0 rad/s). The load voltage is a counter emf with a frequency of 314 rad/s.\n\nThe phase difference between the input voltage and the load voltage is given by:\n\nPhase difference = 2\u03c0f_load / f_input\n\nwhere f_load is the frequency of the load voltage (314 rad/s) and f_input is the frequency of the input voltage (2\u03c0 rad/s).\n\nPhase difference = 2\u03c0(314) / (2\u03c0) = 314 radians\n\nThe firing angle control is the range of phase differences between the input voltage and the load voltage that can be achieved by the circuit. The firing angle control is given by:\n\nFiring angle control = 2\u03c0f_load / f_input - 0\n\nwhere 0 is the phase difference at which the circuit fires.\n\nFor a load counter emf of 200 V, the firing angle control is:\n\nFiring angle control = 2\u03c0(314) / (2\u03c0) - 0 = 314 radians\n\nThe range of firing angle control is the difference between the maximum and minimum firing angle control:\n\nRange of firing angle control = 314 - 0 = 314 radians\n\nSo, the range of firing angle control is 314 radians, which corresponds to a range of 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 in degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.",
