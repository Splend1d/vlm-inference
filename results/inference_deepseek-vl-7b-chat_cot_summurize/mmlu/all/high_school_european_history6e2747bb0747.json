His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT\n\nA. the International Workingman's Association\nB. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\nC. the Congress of Vienna\nD. the Paris Commune\n",

            "content": "The question is asking you to identify which of the given options is NOT related to the radical movement known as anarchism, as mentioned in the first paragraph of the text provided.\n\nThe text mentions that the famous Nihilists, who were part of the radical movement, were focused on national liberation and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered when they had killed their despot. This suggests that they were involved in a struggle for social and political change, which is characteristic of anarchism.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The International Workingman's Association: This was a labor organization founded in 1864, which included anarchists among its members. So, this is related to anarchism.\n\nB. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: He was a French political economist and philosopher who is considered one of the founders of anarchist thought. So, this is related to anarchism.\n\nC. The Congress of Vienna: This was a meeting of European leaders in 1815 that aimed to restore order after the Napoleonic Wars. It is not directly related to anarchism, as it was focused on political and military matters rather than social and political change.\n\nD. The Paris Commune: This was a radical socialist government in Paris in 1871 that was overthrown by the French government. It is related to anarchism because it was a direct challenge to the existing political and social order.\n\nSo, the option that is NOT related to anarchism is the Congress of Vienna.",
