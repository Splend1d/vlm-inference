The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n",

The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. This option assumes that the heat capacity of the sample and water are directly proportional to their temperature change. However, this is not necessarily true. The heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of the substance by one degree Celsius, and it is not directly related to the temperature change of the entire system.\n\nC. This option incorrectly assumes that the heat capacity of the sample is greater than the heat capacity of the water. The heat capacity of a substance is a property of the substance itself, not of the temperature change it undergoes.\n\nD. This option assumes that the equilibrium constant is related to the average temperature of the system. However, the equilibrium constant is a property of the reaction, not of the temperature of the system. The equilibrium constant is the ratio of the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium, and it is not affected by the temperature of the system.",
