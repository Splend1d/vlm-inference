In an effort to avoid striking the victim, the defendant applied his brakes to no avail. The car struck and killed the victim.\n\nIn this situation, the defendant is most likely to be found guilty of murder because he was driving with a defective car brake system, which he knew was dangerous, and he was driving at an excessive speed in a zone with a lower speed limit. His failure to avoid hitting the victim shows a reckless disregard for human life, which is a key element in the definition of murder.",
