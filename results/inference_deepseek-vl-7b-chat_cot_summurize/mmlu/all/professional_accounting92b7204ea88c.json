Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPrice = 100 / (1 - (1 + 0.05)^-1) / (1 + 0.06)\nPrice = 100 / (1 - 1.05^(-1)) / 1.06\nPrice = 100 / (1 - 0.951225) / 1.06\nPrice = 100 / 0.048775 / 1.06\nPrice = 100 * 0.048775 / 1.06\nPrice = 4.8775 / 1.06\nPrice = 4.63\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, the price of the bond is approximately $4.63.
