The error term is typically represented as a vector $u = [u_1, u_2, ..., u_k]^T$, where $u_i$ represents the error for the $i$-th observation.\n\nSince the error term is assumed to be a random variable with mean 0, the expected value of $u$ is 0. Therefore, the dimensions of $u$ are the same as the dimensions of the data, which is $T \\times k$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. T x k",
