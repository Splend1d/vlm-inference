A zero ring is a ring in which every element is a zero (or zero divisor) of every other element.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The ring of complex numbers: In this ring, every nonzero complex number is a zero divisor of 1. However, there are nonzero complex numbers that are not zero divisors of each other. Therefore, this ring is not a zero ring.\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11: In this ring, every nonzero integer is a zero divisor of 1. However, there are nonzero integers that are not zero divisors of each other. Therefore, this ring is not a zero ring.\n\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]: In this ring, every nonzero function is a zero divisor of 0. However, there are nonzero functions that are not zero divisors of each other. Therefore, this ring is not a zero ring.\n\nD. The ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}: In this ring, every nonzero element is a zero divisor of 1. However, there are nonzero elements that are not zero divisors of each other. Therefore, this ring is a zero ring.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.
