Call us to reserve your table. \"The response to the promotion was more than the restaurant expected, and the restaurant was soon overbooked for the Mother's Day brunch. On the day before Mother's Day, the restaurant owner decided to double-check inventory to make sure the restaurant had enough food and supplies to handle the large Mother's Day crowd. To her horror, she discovered that the restaurant was almost out of eggs. Knowing that a large supply of eggs would be needed for the omelet station, the owner immediately sent the following e-mail to her egg supplier:\"Desperately need 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for tomorrow's brunch. Money is no object. The eggs must be delivered today. \"The supplier e-mailed back:\"No problem! I'll load them on the truck and deliver them within the hour. \"With respect to the agreement between the owner and the supplier, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the omittance of a fixed contract price?\n\nA. The contract is unenforceable as violative of the statute of frauds.\nB. The contract is unenforceable, because of indefiniteness.\nC. The contract may be enforceable if it is later modified to include the price term.\nD. The contract is enforceable with reasonable price being fixed at time of delivery.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D. The contract is enforceable with reasonable price being fixed at time of delivery.\n\nThe owner and the supplier did not have a fixed contract price, but they reached an agreement verbally. The owner needed eggs urgently and was willing to pay any price for them. The supplier agreed to deliver the eggs within the hour. This agreement is enforceable because it is a valid contract, even though it does not have a fixed price. The price will be fixed at the time of delivery, which is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no statute of frauds violation in this case. The agreement was made orally, but it is not a contract that cannot be performed orally.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the agreement is not indefinite. It is clear that the owner needs eggs and the supplier will deliver them.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the agreement does not need to be modified to include a price term. The price will be fixed at the time of delivery, which is a reasonable and enforceable term.",
