Bubbles of gas trapped in the crystals within meteorites are identical to the gases trapped in asteroids.\nB. The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.\nC. Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.\nD. The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.\n",
