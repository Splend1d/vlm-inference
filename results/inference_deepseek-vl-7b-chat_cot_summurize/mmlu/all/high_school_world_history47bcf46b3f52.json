No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nThe reference to the \"continual beatings\" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?\n\nA. The invasion of Afghanistan\nB. The creation of the Warsaw Pact\nC. The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe\nD. The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II\n",

            "content": "The question is asking which of the given options is most directly supported by the information provided in the passage. The passage discusses the history of Russia and how it was constantly beaten due to its backwardness. It then connects this to the current situation, stating that \"we must no longer lag behind.\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The invasion of Afghanistan: This was a decision made by the Soviet Union, but the passage does not directly support it. The passage does not mention Afghanistan or any specific foreign policy decision related to it.\n\nB. The creation of the Warsaw Pact: This was a decision made by the Soviet Union to counter the perceived threat from Western countries. The passage does not directly support this decision either. It does not mention the Warsaw Pact or any specific foreign policy decision related to it.\n\nC. The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe: This was a decision made by the Soviet Union, but the passage does not directly support it. The passage does not mention the Brezhnev Doctrine or any specific foreign policy decision related to it.\n\nD. The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II: This was a decision made by the Soviet Union, and the passage directly supports it. The passage discusses the history of Russia being beaten due to its backwardness, and it states that \"we must no longer lag behind.\" This implies that the Soviet Union wanted to avoid being beaten and wanted to be at the forefront of the world, which is why it declared war against Japan at the end of World War II.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II.",
