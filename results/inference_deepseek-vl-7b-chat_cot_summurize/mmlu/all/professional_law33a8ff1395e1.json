Please ship immediately 36 dozen 10-inch hot dog buns at your current list price of $6 per dozen. \"The day after receiving the purchase order, the bakery shipped 24 dozen 10-inch hot dog buns and 12 dozen 8-inch hot dog buns. The owner of the bakery had instructed his staff to include a message that the bakery did not have enough 10-inch hot dog buns to fill the order, so they were including the 8-inch hot dog buns as an accommodation. However, the shipping department forgot to \u0080\u0098include the message with the shipment. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the operator's legal rights following receipt of the hot dog buns?\n\nA.
