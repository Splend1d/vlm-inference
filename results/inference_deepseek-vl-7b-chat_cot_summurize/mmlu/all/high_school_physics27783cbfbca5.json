Since the object floats, the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the water it displaces. We can use Archimedes' principle to find the volume of the object above the surface.\n\nArchimedes' principle states that the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. In this case, the weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the",
