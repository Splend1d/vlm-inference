The result of this reaction produces a major product of 2-butene and a minor product of 1-butene. Which of the following descriptions of the starting compound explains why 2-butene is the major product?\n\nA. Carbon 3 has less hydrogen atoms\nB. 1-butene rearranges to 2-butene in solution\nC. Ethanol prefers the second carbon in any chain\nD. Cyclic aromatization\n",
