This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Changing a diaper is a normal and necessary part of taking care of a baby, and disposing of the dirty diaper is a routine task that is not inherently wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is disciplining their toddler by putting them in a corner for a few minutes. This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Disciplining a child is a common practice in parenting, and the method used in this scenario is generally considered a mild form of discipline. It is not intended to cause harm or to be cruel, but rather to teach the child about right and wrong and to establish boundaries.",
