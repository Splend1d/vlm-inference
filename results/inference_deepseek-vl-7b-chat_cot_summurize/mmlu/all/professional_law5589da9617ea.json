When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for\n\nA.

Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.\nC. Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.\nD. Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.\n",
