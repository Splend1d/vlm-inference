It is a measure of the average price level of all final goods and services produced within an economy. It is calculated by dividing the GDP by the price level of the base year. This allows for a comparison of the price level of goods and services over time, regardless of the composition of GDP.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers. It is a useful measure of inflation, but it does not take into account the prices of capital goods or intermediate goods, which are important components of GDP.\n\nThe real interest rate is the interest rate adjusted for inflation. It is a measure of the return on an investment after adjusting for inflation. However, it does not directly measure changes in the price level of national product.\n\nThe unemployment rate is a measure of the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. It is a useful measure of economic conditions, but it does not directly measure changes in the price level of national product.",
