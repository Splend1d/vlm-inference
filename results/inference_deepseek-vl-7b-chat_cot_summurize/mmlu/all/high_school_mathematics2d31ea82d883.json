            "content": "To find the volume of the solid generated when the region bounded by the y-axis, y = e^x, and y = 2 is rotated around the y-axis, we need to integrate the area of the cross-sectional disks along the y-axis from y = e^x to y = 2.\n\nThe area of each disk is given by the formula A(x) = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the disk. In this case, the radius is the difference between the y-values of the two curves, which is e^x - 2.\n\nNow, we need to integrate A(x) with respect to x from e^x to 2:\n\nVolume = \u222b[A(x) dx] from e^x to 2\nVolume = \u222b[\u03c0(e^x - 2)^2 dx] from e^x to 2\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = e^x, so du = e^x dx. Then, dx = du/e^x.\n\nVolume = \u222b[\u03c0(u - 2)^2 (du/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nVolume = \u03c0 \u222b[(u - 2)^2 (du/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nLet's integrate the numerator:\n\n\u222b[(u - 2)^2 (du/e^x)] = (u - 2)^2 (1/e^x) + C\n\nNow, substitute back for u:\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^x)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^2 - 4e^x + 4e^3)^2 (1/e^x)] from e^x to 2\n\nVolume = \u03c0 [(2 - 2e^",
