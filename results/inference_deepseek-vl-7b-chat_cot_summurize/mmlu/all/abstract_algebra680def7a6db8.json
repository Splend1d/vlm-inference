In this case, we are given the binary operation \"*\" defined as a*b = a + b + 1.\n\nLet's consider the identity element e, such that for any a in Z, a*e = a.\n\nWe can set up the equation a + b + 1 = a for any a and b in Z.\n\nNow, let's solve for e:\n\na + b + 1 = a\nb + 1 = 0\nb = -1\n\nSo, the identity element of this group is -1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. -1",
