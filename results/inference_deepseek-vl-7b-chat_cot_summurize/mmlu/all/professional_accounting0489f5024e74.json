Option contract.\n\nAn option contract is a derivative financial instrument because it gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time period. The other options are not derivatives:\n\nB. Municipal bond: This is a type of fixed-income security issued by a government or its agencies to finance public projects or to borrow money. It is not a derivative because it does not derive its value from an underlying asset.\n\nC. Bank certificate of deposit: This is a type of time deposit offered by banks, where the depositor agrees to leave a specified amount of money with the bank for a fixed period of time in exchange for a higher interest rate than what is typically offered for regular savings accounts. It is not a derivative because it is a form of debt instrument, not a derivative that derives its value from an underlying asset.\n\nD. Money market fund: This is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that invests in short-term debt securities, such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. It is not a derivative because it is a form of investment fund, not a derivative that derives its value from an underlying asset.",
