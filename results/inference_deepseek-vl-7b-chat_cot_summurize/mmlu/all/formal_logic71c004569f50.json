The truth table will have 2 rows and 2 columns, where the first column represents the truth value of O and the second column represents the truth value of P.\n\nHere's the truth table for the given propositions:\n\n| O | P | ~O \u2283 P | O \u2228 P |\n|---|---|--------|-------|\n| T | T |    F   |   T   |\n| T | F |    T   |   T   |\n| F | T |    T   |   T   |\n| F | F |    T   |   T   |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table:\n\n1. ~O \u2283 P: This proposition is true if and only if P is false and O is true. In the table, this is represented by the row where O is true and P is false.\n\n2. O \u2228 P: This proposition is true if at least one of O or P is true. In the table, this is represented by the row where O is true or P is true.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the statements are logically equivalent, contradictory, or consistent:\n\nA. Logically equivalent:\n- ~O \u2283 P: True if P is false and O is true.\n- O \u2228 P: True if O is true or P is true.\n\nThese two propositions are not logically equivalent, as they have different truth conditions.\n\nB. Contradictory:\n- ~O \u2283 P: True if P is false and O is true.\n- O \u2228 P: True if O is true or P is true.\n\nThese two propositions are not contradictory, as they can both be true at the same time.\n\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent:\n- ~O \u2283 P: True if P is false and O is true.\n- O \u2228 P: True if O is true or P is true.\n\nThese two propositions are consistent, as they can both be true or false at the same time.\n\nD. Inconsistent:\n- ~O \u2283 P: True if P is false and O is true.\n- O \u2228 P: True if O is true or P is true.\n\nThese two propositions are not inconsistent, as they can both be true or false at the same time.\n\nIn conclusion, the statements ~O \u2283 P and O \u2228 P are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.",
