Convolving an image with $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ would not change the image\n\nA convolution kernel is a matrix of numbers that is used in the convolution operation in image processing. The operation is performed by sliding the kernel over the image and multiplying it with the image at each point. The result is a new image that contains the information from the original image, but with some of the details smoothed out.\n\nIn this case, the kernel has all its elements equal to 1, except for the diagonal, which has elements equal to 1 and 0. This means that the convolution operation will not change the image, as the diagonal elements will cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",
