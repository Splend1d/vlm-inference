            "content": "The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.\nIn this case, the perimeter is $6+b+c=18$.\nWe can subtract $6$ from both sides to isolate $b+c=12$.\nSince $b$ and $c$ are the lengths of the legs of the triangle, they must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.\nIn this case, we have $c^2=6^2+b^2$.\nSubstituting $b+c=12$, we get $c^2=6^2+b^2=12^2$.\nSimplifying, we have $c^2=144$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $c=\\sqrt{144}=12$.\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is $\\boxed{C}$.\nThe answer is: 12",
