            "content": "While undergoing a routine plastic surgery procedure, a patient died on the operating table. The patient's husband is suing the plastic surgeon alleging malpractice. Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met the highest standards for medical care. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death. The witness stated that \"the expert told me the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. \"On objection to this testimony, defendant's attorney seeks a ruling on the admissibility of this question and answer. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the testimony is hearsay.\nB. overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\nC. sustain the objection, because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.\nD. overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.\n",

            "content": "The trial judge should overrule the objection, because a prior consistent statement may be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony. The witness's statement is a prior consistent statement because it is consistent with his earlier testimony as an expert witness. The fact that the expert witness and the surgeon had a business relationship does not necessarily mean that the expert's testimony was motivated by that relationship. The expert's statement that the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it is relevant to the case and should be admissible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. overrule the objection, because a prior consistent statement may be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.",
