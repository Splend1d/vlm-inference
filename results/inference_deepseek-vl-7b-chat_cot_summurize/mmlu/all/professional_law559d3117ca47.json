The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is D. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe proposal is to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. This means that the new preferred stock would have a higher claim on the company's assets in case of liquidation, which is a significant change in the company's capital structure.\n\nAccording to the rules of the corporation, a two-thirds vote of each class of stock is required for such a significant change. In this case, the old preferred stock is one class, and the common stock is another class.\n\nThe vote of the common stockholders is not relevant to the approval of the proposal, as they do not have a say in the matter. The vote of the preferred stockholders is also not relevant, as the proposal is for a new class of preferred stock, not for the existing preferred stock.\n\nTherefore, the proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required, and only a majority of the outstanding shares did approve, not a two-thirds vote of each class.",
