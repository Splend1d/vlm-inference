When done correctly, a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample.\nB. When done correctly, a stratified random sampling process has less variability from sample to sample than a simple random sample.\nC. When done correctly, a stratified random sample can provide, with a smaller sample size, an estimate that is just as reliable as that of a simple random sample with a larger sample size.\nD. A stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.\n",
