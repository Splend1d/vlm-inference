Since the friend died intestate before the wheat he had planted could be harvested, the land would pass according to the terms of the deed.\n\nThe deed stated that if the interest conveyed to the cousin is not valid, the woman reserves the right to re-enter the land and take back her property. However, since the cousin is not mentioned in the deed as having any interest in the land, the land would pass to the cousin according to the terms of the deed.\n\nTherefore, the cousin is entitled to the proceeds of the crop.\n\nSo, the answer is B.
