For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n",

The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nUnder the doctrine of lapse, if a testator dies without having revoked a will, the will is deemed to have lapsed and the property reverts to the estate for distribution according to the terms of the will. In this case, the woman never changed her will, and the will was admitted to probate. Therefore, the property reverts to the estate, and the niece, as the residuary legatee, is entitled to the home.\n\nThe doctrine of ademption does not apply because the will was not executed in such a way that the farm would be considered as having been paid out in satisfaction of the residue of the estate. The doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply because the niece did not rely on the woman's promise to change her will.",
