            "content": "I. M-7\u2019s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\nThis statement is true. A pipeline with more stages can process instructions more quickly than a pipeline with fewer stages. M-7 has a 7-stage pipeline, while M-5 has a 5-stage pipeline. Therefore, M-7's pipeline can process more instructions per clock cycle than M-5's pipeline, resulting in a higher maximum throughput.\n\nII. The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Latency refers to the time it takes for a single instruction to complete execution. While M-7's pipeline has more stages, this does not necessarily mean that it has shorter latency. The latency of a single instruction depends on the specific pipeline stages and their execution times, not just the number of stages.\n\nIII. Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The speed of a program depends on many factors, including the efficiency of the program's code, the specific instructions it uses, and the characteristics of the hardware it is running on. While M-7's pipeline may have better throughput, this does not guarantee that programs will always run faster on M-7 than on M-5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. I only.",
