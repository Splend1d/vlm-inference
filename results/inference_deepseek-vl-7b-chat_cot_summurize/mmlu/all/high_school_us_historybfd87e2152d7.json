            "content": "This question refers to the following information.\nOf all the band of adventurous cavaliers, whom Spain, in the sixteenth century, sent forth on the career of discovery and conquest, there was none more deeply filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise than Hernando Cortes. Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nGiven the perspective of the passage above, William Hickling Prescott believed which of the following about the conquest of the Aztec Empire?\n\nA. The actions of Hernando Cortes were irrational.\nB. The conquest of Mexico was a racist atrocity.\nC. Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth.\nD. The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n",

            "content": "The passage provided by William Hickling Prescott discusses Hernando Cortes and his conquest of the Aztec Empire. The author emphasizes Cortes's spirit of romantic enterprise and his determination to conquer Mexico despite the vastness of the task. The passage also highlights the diverse group of individuals that Cortes assembled to fight under his command, including adventurers, hidalgos, and native tribes. Despite these differences, Cortes was able to bring them together under one standard and achieve a great feat.\n\nOption A, stating that Cortes's actions were irrational, is not supported by the passage. The author does not suggest that Cortes's actions were illogical or unreasonable.\n\nOption B, claiming that the conquest of Mexico was a racist atrocity, is not supported by the passage. The author does not make any statements about the conquest being racist or an atrocity.\n\nOption C, suggesting that Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth, is not directly supported by the passage. While the author does mention that Cortes and his men were seeking gold, it is not the primary focus of the passage.\n\nOption D, stating that the Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain, aligns with the author's perspective. The passage emphasizes Cortes's ability to bring together a diverse group of individuals and his determination to conquer Mexico. This suggests that the Aztec Empire was not strong enough to withstand the superior forces of Spain.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the most accurate answer is option D. William Hickling Prescott believed that the Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
