            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the time it takes for two-thirds of the substance to decay. So, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n(2/3) * Initial Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nWe know that the half-life is 8 years, so we can plug that into the equation:\n\n(2/3) * Initial Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / 8)\n\nNow, we want to find the time elapsed, which is the time it takes for two-thirds of the substance to decay. So, we can rearrange the equation to solve for time elapsed:\n\ntime elapsed = 8 * log2((2/3) / Initial Amount)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for time elapsed:\n\ntime elapsed = 8 * log2((2/3) / 0.5)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\ntime elapsed \u2248 8 * log2(0.3333) \u2248 8 * 0.6931 \u2248 5.5448\n\nNow, we can convert this to years:\n\ntime elapsed \u2248 5.5448 * 10^(-1) \u2248 0.55448\n\nFinally, we can find the time it takes for two-thirds of the substance to decay:\n\ntime elapsed \u2248 0.55448 * 8 \u2248 4.68 years\n\nSo, the answer is A. 4.68 years.",
