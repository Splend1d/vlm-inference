            "content": "To determine the final temperature of the helium gas, we can use the ideal gas law, which states that the pressure of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its volume and constant at a constant temperature. The equation is:\n\nP * V = n * R * T\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K), and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of helium gas in the sample. We can use the ideal gas law to do this:\n\nn = P_initial * V / R\n\nwhere P_initial is the initial pressure in mm Hg, V is the initial volume in L, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K).\n\nP_initial = 875 mm Hg\nV_initial = 5.00 L\nR = 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K\n\nn_initial = (875 * 10^3) / 8.314\nn_initial = 1050 moles\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the final temperature (T_final) when the volume is 10.00 L:\n\nT_final = (P_final * V_final) / n_final\n\nwhere P_final is the final pressure, V_final is the final volume, and n_final is the final number of moles.\n\nP_final = 1000 mm Hg (since 1 atm = 1000 mm Hg)\nV_final = 10.00 L\nn_final = 1050 moles\n\nT_final = (1000 * 10.00) / 1050\nT_final = 973.15 K\n\nNow, we need to convert the temperature from Kelvin to degrees Celsius:\n\nT_final = 973.15 K * (1/273.15)\nT_final = 373.15 K\n\nFinally, we can convert the temperature from Kelvin to degrees Celsius:\n\nT_final = 373.15 K * (1/273.15)\nT_final = 14.00 \u00b0C\n\nSo, the final temperature of the helium gas is 14.00 \u00b0C.
