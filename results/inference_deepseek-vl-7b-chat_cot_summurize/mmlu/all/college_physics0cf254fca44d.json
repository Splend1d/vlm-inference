            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the sound to travel from the police car to the wall and back, and then divide the total time by the frequency of the siren to find the frequency of the echo.\n\nFirst, let's find the distance the sound needs to travel. The speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the distance is the length of the wall, which we don't know. Let's call it \"d\".\n\nThe time it takes for the sound to travel from the police car to the wall is:\n\nt1 = d / 350 m/s\n\nThe time it takes for the sound to travel back from the wall to the police car is:\n\nt2 = d / 350 m/s\n\nThe total time for the sound to travel back and forth is:\n\nt = t1 + t2\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency of the echo. The frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, and the frequency of the echo is the total time divided by the time it takes for one cycle of the siren.\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) / 600 Hz\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) / 600 Hz\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) * 1 / 600 Hz\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) * 1 / 600 Hz\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we know:\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) * 1 / 600 Hz\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) * 1 / 600 Hz\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) * 1 / 600 Hz\n\nFrequency of the echo = (t / t1) * 1 / 600 Hz\n\nSince we don't know the distance \"d\", we can't find the exact frequency of the echo. However, we can find the frequency nearest to the options given.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 600 Hz\nB. 606 Hz\nC. 612 Hz\nD. 618 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the echo will be closest to option B, which is 606 Hz.",
