            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes and the number of outcomes where each integer has a different tens digit.\n\nThere are 4 tens digits (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 5 integers. For each integer, there are 4 possible tens digits. So, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n4 (tens digits) * 5 (integers) = 20\n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where each integer has a different tens digit. We can do this by considering the number of ways we can choose the tens digit for the first integer, then the tens digit for the second integer, and so on.\n\nFor the first integer, there are 4 possible tens digits. For the second integer, there are 3 possible tens digits (since one of them has already been used). For the third integer, there are 2 possible tens digits. For the fourth integer, there is only 1 possible tens digit left. Finally, for the fifth integer, there is only 1 possible tens digit left.\n\nSo, the number of outcomes where each integer has a different tens digit is:\n\n4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 24\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of outcomes where each integer has a different tens digit by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of outcomes with different tens digits) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 24 / 20\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 6 / 5\n\nSo, the probability that the 5 integers each have a different tens digit is 6/5.
