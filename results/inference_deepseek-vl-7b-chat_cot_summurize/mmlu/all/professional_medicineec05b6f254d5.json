During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\nA. Median nerve at the wrist\nB. Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\nC. Radial nerve at the forearm\nD. Ulnar nerve at the elbow\n",

            "content": "The most likely cause of the numbness and tingling in the woman's right hand is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist. This condition, known as carpal tunnel syndrome, occurs when the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in the wrist. This compression can lead to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the hand and fingers. The woman's history of playing as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago, and her occupation as a cashier, which involves repetitive hand movements, are risk factors for developing carpal tunnel syndrome. The examination findings, such as decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger, support the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.",
