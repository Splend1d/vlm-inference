Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nSusan B.

            "content": "The correct answer is A. The Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThe passage provided by Martin Luther King, Jr. in his \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\" discusses the interconnectedness of communities and the need to address injustice. He emphasizes the idea that what happens in one place affects everyone else, and that anyone living in the United States cannot be considered an outsider. This idea is in line with the women's rights movement, which fought for the right to vote and was successful in getting the Nineteenth Amendment ratified.\n\nThe Nineteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1920, granted women the right to vote. This was a major victory for the women's rights movement, and it was made possible by the efforts of many activists, including Susan B. Anthony. The passage from King's letter highlights the importance of this victory and the broader fight for justice and equality that it represents.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nB. The Equal Rights Amendment was not ratified until 1972, after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.\nC. The Fifteenth Amendment, which granted African Americans the right to vote, was ratified in 1870, long before the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.\nD. The Twenty-sixth Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18, was ratified in 1971, after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment.",
