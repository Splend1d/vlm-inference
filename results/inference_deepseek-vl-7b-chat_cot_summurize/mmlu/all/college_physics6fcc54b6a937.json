In this case, both satellites A and B have the same mass, so the ratio of their angular momenta will be the square root of the ratio of their orbital radii.\n\nThe orbital radius of satellite A is twice that of satellite B, so the ratio of their orbital radii is 2:1. Therefore, the ratio of their angular momenta is the square root of 2:1, which is 1:sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 1/sqrt(2).",
