            "content": "A doctor was the owner of 1,500 acres of undeveloped timberland. In September 1989, the doctor executed a warranty deed conveying the timberland property to a dentist in fee simple. The dentist recorded immediately in the Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Index. Then in April 1990, the dentist conveyed the same tract to a buyer in fee simple by warranty deed. The buyer paid full market value and recorded the deed at once in the Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Index. The land in question had never been occupied, fenced, or cleared except that between the years 1986 \u0080\u00942010, a mining company, one mile from the property, regularly drove trucks over a cleared path pursuant to a 1986 agreement with the doctor. The agreement, which was duly recorded, provided that \"the parties expressly agree and the doctor promises that the doctor and his successors shall refrain from obstructing the said described pathway across the doctor's land, which the mining company and its successors may perpetually use as a road, in consideration of which the mining company and its successors will pay the sum of $700 per annum. \"In 1990, after the conveyance from the dentist, the buyer informed the mining company that he would no longer honor the 1986 agreement permitting the mining company to use the pathway. The mining company brought an action for specific performance. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the mining company, because their property interest would \"run with the land. \"\nB. the mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.\nC. the buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.\nD. the buyer, because there was no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is C. the buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.\n\nThe mining company's interest in the pathway was a servient estate, which means it was dependent on the dominant estate (the doctor's land) for its existence. The 1986 agreement between the doctor and the mining company provided that the doctor and his successors would refrain from obstructing the pathway, and in return, the mining company would pay $700 per annum. This agreement was duly recorded, and the mining company's interest in the pathway was considered to be a property interest that \"runs with the land.\"\n\nHowever, when the doctor conveyed the land to the dentist, the mining company's interest in the pathway was extinguished because the dentist, as the new owner of the dominant estate, could have the pathway closed or obstructed. When the dentist conveyed the land to the buyer, the mining company's interest was further extinguished because the buyer, as the new owner of the dominant estate, could also have the pathway closed or obstructed.\n\nTherefore, the mining company's interest in the pathway was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance from the dentist to the buyer, and the buyer should be held liable for the mining company's action for specific performance.",
