The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is even because each vertex is connected to an even number of other vertices (either 0 or 2).\n\nII. |E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1. This is true for a connected, undirected graph. The number of edges in a graph is always greater than or equal to the number of vertices minus one. This is because each vertex can be connected to every other vertex, except itself and the vertex it is connected to.\n\nIII. G has at least one vertex with degree 1. This is not necessarily true for a connected, undirected graph. For example, consider a complete graph with 4 vertices, K4. In this graph, each vertex is connected to every other vertex, so all vertices have a degree of 3. Therefore, there is no vertex with a degree of 1.\n\nTherefore, only statements I and II must be true for a connected, undirected graph.",
