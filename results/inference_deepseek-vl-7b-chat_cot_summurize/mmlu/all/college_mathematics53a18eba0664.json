A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices.\nSince A and B are similar matrices, their difference by a scalar (in this case, 2) will also be similar. This is because the similarity of two matrices is preserved under scalar multiplication and addition of matrices. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace.\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal. Since A and B are similar matrices, their traces must be equal. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nIII. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices.\nThe inverse of a matrix is the reciprocal of the matrix raised to the power of -1. Since A and B are similar matrices, their inverses will also be similar. This is because the similarity of two matrices is preserved under taking inverses. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nTherefore, all three statements I, II, and III must be true.\n\nSo, the answer is D.",
