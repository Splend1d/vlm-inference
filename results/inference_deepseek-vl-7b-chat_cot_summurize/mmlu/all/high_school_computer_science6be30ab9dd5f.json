This is because the total number of words in all the books can be calculated as 3 million books * 400 pages per book * 50 lines per page * 10 words per line * 5 letters per word = 3 * 400 * 50 * 10 * 5 = 3 * 2000000000 = 600000000000000. Since each byte is 1 unit, the total number of bytes required is 600000000000000 / 1 = 600000000000000. This is approximately equal to 10^15 bytes, which is the definition of a Petabyte.",
