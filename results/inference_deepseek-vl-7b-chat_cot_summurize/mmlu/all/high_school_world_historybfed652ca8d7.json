Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nThe poem provides evidence of which of the following with respect to gender relations in Tang society?\n\nA. Confucian relationships between husband and wife were still strong in Tang society.\nB. Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas.\nC. Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike.\nD. Traditional Chinese gender relations were reversed during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian.\n",

            "content": "The poem \"Ballad of the Army Carts\" by Du Fu provides evidence of gender relations in Tang society, specifically highlighting the negative impact of the military on families, particularly those with sons. The soldier's lament about the hardships of being a father in this time, particularly the negative impact on sons, suggests that the poem is not primarily concerned with the strength of Confucian relationships between husband and wife or the sharing of agricultural work by women and men. It also does not mention any specific emphasis on the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas, nor does it discuss the reversal of traditional Chinese gender relations during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian.\n\nTherefore, the poem provides evidence of Imperial rescripts emphasizing the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas. This is supported by the soldier's statement, \"But sir, though it's good of you to ask, complaining isn't part of the soldier's task. We can only shake our heads. Take this winter: The Shanxi troops were never sent home. The District Officers are demanding the land tax, but where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\" This implies that the government was demanding sons for the military, as the soldier implies that the government is \"demanding the land tax\" from the people, which could be interpreted as the demand for sons for the military.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas.",
