The psychologist who is the principal investigator tells you to discourage participants from leaving the group prior to the end of the study because, if too many participants drop out, the study's potential usefulness will be seriously compromised. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. refuse to assist with the research project.\nB. immediately file a complaint against the psychologist with the psychology licensing board or ethics committee.\nC. write a letter to the psychologist, indicating the relevant ethical standards and offering to discuss the matter with him.\nD. \"follow the psychologist''s instructions since, by \"\"discouraging\"\" participants from leaving the group, you are not actually coercing them to participate.\"\n",
