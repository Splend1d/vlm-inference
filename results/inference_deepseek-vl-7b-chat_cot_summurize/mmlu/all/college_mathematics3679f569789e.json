The rearrangement inequality, also known as the rearrangement theorem, states that if a sequence of real numbers is rearranged, the sum of the rearranged sequence is greater than or equal to the sum of the original sequence. In this case, the sum of the absolute values of the terms is divergent (\u2211|a_i| diverges), but the sum of the terms themselves is finite (\u2211 a_i = 2). Therefore, there exists a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that the sum of the rearranged sequence (\u2211 a_i_k) is greater than the sum of the original sequence (\u2211 a_i). In this case, \u2211 a_i_k = 4, which is greater than \u2211 a_i = 2.\n\nStatement 2: There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded\u201d.\n\nThis statement is also true. The given statement is a well-known result in topology, known as the Banach-Mazur theorem. It states that there exist two separable metric spaces X and Y, and a continuous function f: X \u2192 Y such that the image of X under f, f(X), is not closed and bounded in Y. This result shows that the properties of continuity and closedness of a function are not always preserved under the image of a space.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.
