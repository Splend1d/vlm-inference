            "content": "Restricting the spread of filoviruses, such as the Ebola virus, can be achieved through a combination of strategies. Here are the options you provided, along with explanations for each:\n\nA. New antivirals: Developing new antiviral drugs can help treat filovirus infections, which can reduce the severity of the disease and decrease the risk of transmission. However, antivirals alone may not be sufficient to completely restrict the spread of the virus, as they are typically used in conjunction with other measures.\n\nB. New humanised monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced proteins that can help neutralize the virus or enhance the immune response. Humanised monoclonal antibodies are designed to be more effective in humans. While these can be a valuable tool in the treatment of filovirus infections, they are not a direct method to restrict the spread of the virus.\n\nC. Hygiene and social distancing: These are essential public health measures to prevent the spread of any infectious disease. Good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, can reduce the risk of transmission. Social distancing, which involves reducing close contact with others, can also help limit the spread of the virus. These measures are particularly important in the early stages of an outbreak to slow the spread of the virus and allow for better control and containment.\n\nD. New vaccines: Developing a vaccine for filoviruses is a critical component in their control. A vaccine can provide immunity to the virus, reducing the number of cases and the severity of disease. However, the development of a vaccine for filoviruses is a complex and challenging process, and it may take several years to develop and gain regulatory approval.\n\nIn summary, while antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines can be important tools in the fight against filoviruses, the most effective way to restrict their spread is through hygiene and social distancing measures. These are the most immediate and direct ways to prevent the spread of the virus and can be implemented at a population level.",
