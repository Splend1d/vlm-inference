Assuming the average American drives 12,000 miles per year, the total energy consumption of an electric car per year would be 12,000 * 100 * 100 = 1,200,000 kWh.\n\nThe total energy consumption of the United States is about 1,000,000,000,000 kWh per year (source: U.S. Energy Information Administration).\n\nIf everyone in the United States were to drive electric cars, the total energy consumption would increase by 1,200,000,000,000 kWh per year.\n\nTo convert this to joules, we multiply by 10^18:\n\n1,200,000,000,000 kWh * 10^18 J/kWh = 1,200,000,000,000 * 10^18 J\n\nThis equals 1,200,000,000,000,000,000 J, which is 1.2 * 10^21 J.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 2*10^21 J.",
