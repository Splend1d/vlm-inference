To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers?\n\nA. Direct rule by the crown\nB. Complete privatization of colonial authority\nC. Martial law enforced by sizable armies\nD. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits\n",

            "content": "The authors of both passages served institutions associated with the colonial technique commonly used by Western imperial powers known as \"the chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits.\" \n\nWilliam Bentinck, Governor-General of India, and George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, both served in positions that were associated with the British East India Company and the Hudson's Bay Company, respectively. These were chartered companies that were given the right to trade and govern in certain territories, and they shared the profits with the British Crown. \n\nThe British East India Company, established in 1600, was a joint-stock company chartered by King James I to trade with the East Indies. It was the largest and most powerful trading company in the world for over 250 years. The Hudson's Bay Company, established in 1670, was a joint-stock company chartered by King Charles II to trade with the indigenous peoples of North America. Both companies were given extensive powers to govern and trade in their respective territories, and they shared the profits with the British Crown.\n\nThe other options are not mentioned in the passages or are not the colonial techniques associated with the authors' positions. Direct rule by the crown (A) would be more in line with direct colonial rule, which is not mentioned in the passages. Complete privatization of colonial authority (B) is not mentioned in the passages, and martial law enforced by sizable armies (C) is not mentioned in the passages either.",
