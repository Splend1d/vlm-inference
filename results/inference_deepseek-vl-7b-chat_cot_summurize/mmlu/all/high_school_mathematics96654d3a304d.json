            "content": "The expression $\\dbinom{85}{82}$ represents the number of ways to choose 82 objects from a set of 85 distinct objects.\nThis can be calculated using the formula $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n!$ represents the factorial of $n$.\n\nIn this case, we have $n=85$ and $r=82$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get $\\dbinom{85}{82} = \\dfrac{85!}{82!(85-82)!}$.\n\nSimplifying the factorials, we have $\\dbinom{85}{82} = \\dfrac{85!}{82! \\cdot 3!}$.\n\nSince $3! = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$, we can further simplify to $\\dbinom{85}{82} = \\dfrac{85!}{82! \\cdot 6}$.\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator, which are $82!$.\n\nThis leaves us with $\\dbinom{85}{82} = \\dfrac{85}{82} = \\dfrac{5}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\dbinom{85}{82}$ is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{4}}$.\nThe answer is: \\frac{5}{4}",
