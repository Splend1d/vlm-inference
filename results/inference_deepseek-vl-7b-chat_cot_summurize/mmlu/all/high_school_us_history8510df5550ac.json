I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did\u2014we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\u2014we only continue the march of the flag?\n\u2014Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" Indianapolis, September 16, 1898\nThe policy advocated by Beveridge foreshadowed which of the following?\n\nA. The rise of the United States to the status of a great power\nB. A period of growing isolationism\nC. A period of laissez-faire economics\nD. Growing support for constitutional strict constructionism\n",

            "content": "The passage provided by Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" is a speech given in Indianapolis on September 16, 1898. In this speech, Beveridge discusses the American ability to govern and the expansion of the United States' territories. He argues that the United States has the capability to govern foreign lands, just as England and Germany have done, and that the administration of Hawaii is no more difficult than that of New Mexico or California. He also emphasizes the idea that the United States is continuing the march of the flag, symbolizing the expansion of the country.\n\nThe policy advocated by Beveridge in this speech foreshadows the rise of the United States to the status of a great power. This is because he emphasizes the country's ability to govern foreign lands and its expansion, which are key factors in becoming a great power. The speech does not suggest a period of growing isolationism, laissez-faire economics, or support for constitutional strict constructionism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The rise of the United States to the status of a great power.",
