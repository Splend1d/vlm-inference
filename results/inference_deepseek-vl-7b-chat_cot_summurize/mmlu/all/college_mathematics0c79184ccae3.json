            "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the area of the region described by the inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1. This region is a square with side length 1, so its area is 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the region described by the inequality 2(x + y) > 1. This region is a square with side length 1/2, so its area is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a point (x, y) in R^2 is chosen from the region described by the inequality 2(x + y) > 1. This means that the point lies inside the square with side length 1/2.\n\nThe probability that a point is chosen from the region described by the inequality 2(x + y) > 1 is the ratio of the area of this region to the area of the entire square with side length 1.\n\nSo, the probability is (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
