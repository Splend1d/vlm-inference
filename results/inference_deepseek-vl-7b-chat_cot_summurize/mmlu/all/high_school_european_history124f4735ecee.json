I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.\nThe great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?\n\u2014Charles Fourier, On Education, 1838\nMany in Fourier's circles advocated for universal male suffrage, which was propagated most by which of the following groups?\n\nA. Luddites\nB. Liberals\nC. Benthamites\nD. Chartists\n",

The passage provided does not mention any specific group advocating for universal male suffrage. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine which group propagated this idea most in Fourier's circles.\n\nHowever, if we consider the historical context, we can infer that the group most likely to have propagated the idea of universal male suffrage in Fourier's circles would be the Chartists. The Chartists were a group of working-class radicals in England who advocated for universal male suffrage, among other reforms. They were active during the early 19th century, which is the same time period as Charles Fourier's work.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context, the correct answer would be D. Chartists.",
