            "content": "The passage you provided is from a speech given by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914, where he declared the United States' neutrality during World War I. The passage does not provide information about debates over American involvement overseas after World War I, nor does it mention that Americans generally favored the new era of American involvement overseas. It also does not mention \"dollar diplomacy\" as a factor in American involvement in World War I.\n\nThe passage does, however, mention that the United States had a long tradition of maintaining an impartial neutrality during international conflicts, and that this tradition required the United States to remain at peace with all of the belligerents in a conflict and to not take part in the conflict directly or indirectly.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is most accurate based on the passage you provided is:\n\nC. American involvement in World War I was an extension of a long tradition of involvement overseas.",
