This relationship is known as De Broglie's wavelength-momentum relation, which is expressed as:\n\np = h * \u03bb\n\nwhere p is the linear momentum of the particle, h is Planck's constant, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the particle. This relation is fundamental in quantum mechanics and helps explain the dual nature of matter and energy.",
