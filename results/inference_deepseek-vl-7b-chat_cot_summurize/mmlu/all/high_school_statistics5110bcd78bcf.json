It is known that the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures. Which of the following is an appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation, and why?\n\nA. Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nB. Cluster sample, because the population is divided into five clusters\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nC. Simple random sample, because this is the simplest sampling method\nD. Simple random sample, because this is the only method that gives unbiased results\n",

Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\n\nIn this situation, a stratified sample would be the most appropriate sampling technique. A stratified sample divides the population into distinct subgroups or strata, in this case, the five offices in five different countries. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking, as it ensures that each stratum (country) is represented proportionally in the sample. This helps to account for the variation in views due to different local social structures within each country.\n\nThe other options are not as suitable for this situation:\n\nB. Cluster sample: This would involve grouping the offices into clusters, which may not accurately represent the diversity of views within each country.\n\nC. Simple random sample: This would involve selecting offices without any particular stratification, which may not accurately represent the diversity of views within each country.\n\nD. Simple random sample: This would also involve selecting offices without any particular stratification, which may not accurately represent the diversity of views within each country.",
