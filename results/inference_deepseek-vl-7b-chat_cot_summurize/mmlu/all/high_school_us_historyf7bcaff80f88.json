We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nThe \"free silver\" campaign of 1896 received its greatest popular support from\n\nA.

            "content": "The \"free silver\" campaign of 1896 received its greatest popular support from D. farmers, who hoped that a more generous money supply would ease their debt burdens.\n\nThe Populist Party, as mentioned in the text, was concerned with the plight of the common people, who were suffering from the effects of the existing economic system. The passage highlights the struggles of the people, the grievous wrongs inflicted upon them, and the lack of serious effort by the political parties to address these issues. The Populist Party sought to restore the government to the hands of \"the plain people,\" with the aim of forming a more perfect union and establishing justice, among other objectives.\n\nThe \"free silver\" campaign was a part of the Populist Party's platform, which advocated for the use of silver as a currency, rather than gold, to maintain a more stable and accessible money supply. This was seen as a way to address the economic hardships faced by farmers, who were struggling with debt and falling crop prices. By advocating for a more generous money supply, the Populist Party hoped to ease the burden of debt for farmers and provide them with a more stable economic foundation.\n\nThe other options provided do not align with the historical context and objectives of the Populist Party. New England businessmen were not a significant supporter of the \"free silver\" campaign, as they were more focused on the existing banking system. Southern women, while they may have been involved in broader campaigns for economic equality, were not a primary supporter of the \"free silver\" campaign. Bankers, who had run out of paper currency to invest, were not a significant supporter of the \"free silver\" campaign either, as they were more likely to be in favor of the existing gold standard.\n\nTherefore, the greatest popular support for the \"free silver\" campaign of 1896 came from farmers, who hoped that a more generous money supply would ease their debt burdens.",
