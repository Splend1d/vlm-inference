However, if Granny instructed the character to take the gun out for a specific reason, then it would not be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character held a party with their friends online during the pandemic. This could be seen as morally wrong if the character did not follow public health guidelines or if they put their friends at risk.
