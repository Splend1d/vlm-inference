            "content": "The question is asking for the condition under which the equilibrium between two charged objects, A and B, will be maintained if the mass of Object A is halved.\n\nThe force of attraction between two charged objects is inversely proportional to the square of their charges and proportional to the product of their masses. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nF = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force of attraction, k is a constant, q1 and q2 are the charges of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nSince the gravitational and electrostatic forces between the two objects are equal, we can equate the two forces:\n\nF_A = F_B\n\nwhere F_A and F_B are the forces of attraction between Objects A and B, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition when the mass of Object A is halved. This means that the new mass of Object A is 0.5 * m_A. The new force of attraction between Objects A and B will be:\n\nF_A' = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2\n\nwhere F_A' is the new force of attraction between Objects A and B.\n\nSince the force of attraction is inversely proportional to the square of the charges, we can write:\n\nF_A' = k * (q1 * q2) / (r^2 * m_A')\n\nwhere m_A' is the new mass of Object A.\n\nNow, we can equate the two forces:\n\nF_A' = F_B\n\nk * (q1 * q2) / (r^2 * m_A') = k * (q1 * q2) / (r^2 * m_B)\n\nwhere m_B is the mass of Object B.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(m_A' * m_B) = (m_A * m_B)\n\nSince m_A' = 0.5 * m_A, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n0.5 * (m_A * m_B) = (m_A * m_B)\n\nDividing both sides by m_A * m_B, we get:\n\n0.5 = 1\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that the equilibrium between the two objects cannot be maintained if the mass of Object A is halved. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the mass on Object B were halved",
