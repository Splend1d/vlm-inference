Which of the following is true about water potential?\n\nA. An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\nD. Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\n",

Solute potential is not the only factor that determines water potential. Pressure potential also plays a role.\nC. Pressure potential does not combine with solute potential to determine water potential. Instead, it is a separate factor that can affect water potential.\nD. Water potential does not always drive water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential. The direction of water movement depends on the difference in solute potential between the two solutions.",
