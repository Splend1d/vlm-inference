Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000\n\nWhen Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries, it means that the company is spending $300,000 to cover the wages of its employees. This is an expense for the company, as it is using up its cash to pay for these salaries.\n\nHowever, the impact on assets and liabilities can be different depending on the company's financial situation. If the company has enough cash on hand to cover the $300,000 expense, then its cash balance will decrease by $300,000. This is because the company is using up its cash to pay for salaries.\n\nHowever, if the company does not have enough cash on hand to cover the $300,000 expense, then it will need to use other assets to cover the expense. This could include using other forms of cash, such as short-term investments, or using non-cash assets, such as inventory or accounts receivable. In this case, the company's cash balance would decrease by $300,000, but its total assets would also decrease by the same amount.\n\nTherefore, the impact on assets and liabilities would be that the company's cash balance decreases by $300,000, but its total assets would also decrease by the same amount. This would result in a decrease in the company's liabilities, as the company is using up its assets to cover the expense.",
