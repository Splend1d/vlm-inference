            "content": "The correct answer is C. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-].\n\nIn an aqueous solution, sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is dissociated into its ions:\n\n1. H2SO3(aq) \u21cc H+(aq) + SO32-(aq)\n2. H+(aq) \u21cc H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq)\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that:\n\n1. [H2SO3] = [H+(aq)] + [SO32-(aq)]\n2. [H+(aq)] = [H3O+(aq)] + [OH-(aq)]\n\nCombining these equations, we get:\n\n[H2SO3] = [H3O+(aq)] + [OH-(aq)] + [SO32-(aq)]\n\nSince [H3O+(aq)] and [OH-(aq)] are equal in concentration, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n[H2SO3] = 2[SO32-(aq)]\n\nThis means that the concentration of H2SO3 is twice the concentration of SO32-.\n\nNow, let's compare the other ions:\n\n1. [HSO3-] is the conjugate base of H2SO3, so its concentration is equal to the concentration of H2SO3.\n2. [SO32-] is the conjugate acid of H2SO3, so its concentration is equal to the concentration of H2SO3.\n\nTherefore, the concentrations of the three ions are:\n\n[H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-]",
