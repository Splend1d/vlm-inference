The ideals of the Russian Revolution were betrayed by the Leninist and Stalinist regimes.\nThis proposition suggests that the ideals of the Russian Revolution were not upheld by the Leninist and Stalinist regimes. However, the chart shows a steady increase in literacy rates during the time of the Leninist and Stalinist regimes, which could be interpreted as a positive outcome of the revolution.\n\nB. Lenin and Stalin vastly improved Russian military preparedness.\nThis proposition is not directly related to the literacy rates shown in the chart. The chart only provides information about literacy rates, not about military preparedness.\n\nC. Communism has been made to work more efficiently in Russia than in China.\nThis proposition is not directly supported by the chart. The chart only provides information about literacy rates in Russia, not about the efficiency of communism in different countries.\n\nD. Despite abuses on the part of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet regime managed significant achievements.\nThis proposition suggests that the Soviet regime achieved significant things despite the abuses committed by Lenin and Stalin. The chart shows a steady increase in literacy rates during the time of the Leninist and Stalinist regimes, which could be interpreted as a significant achievement.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the most supported by the chart. It directly relates to the increase in literacy rates shown in the chart and suggests that the Soviet regime achieved significant things despite the abuses committed by Lenin and Stalin.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
