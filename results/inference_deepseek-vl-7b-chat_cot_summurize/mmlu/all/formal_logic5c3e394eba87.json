Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, which can be represented as (F \u2283 ~E).\n2. Or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds, which can be represented as (C \u2261 ~S).\n\nCombining these two parts, we get (F \u2283 ~E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S), which is option A.",
