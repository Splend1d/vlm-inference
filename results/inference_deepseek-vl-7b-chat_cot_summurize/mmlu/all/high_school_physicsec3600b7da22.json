            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the Ideal Gas Law, which is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nWe are given the initial pressure P, initial volume V, and initial temperature T. We are also given the final volume Vf and the piston movement, which allows heat to escape the gas and maintain the temperature constant.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles (n) of the gas. We can use the Ideal Gas Law to do this:\n\nn = V / (RT)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nn = 20 cm^3 / (8.314 J/(mol\u00b7K) * 273 K)\nn = 20 cm^3 / (209.0 J/(mol\u00b7K))\nn \u2248 0.00092 mol\n\nNow that we have the number of moles, we can use the Ideal Gas Law to find the final pressure:\n\nP_final = (n * R * T) / Vf\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP_final = (0.00092 mol * 8.314 J/(mol\u00b7K) * 273 K) / 5 cm^3\nP_final \u2248 0.25 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nSo, the resulting pressure will be approximately 0.25 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.
