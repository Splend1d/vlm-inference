Determine the number of possible abelian groups for each prime factor:\n   - For 2^3, there are 4 possible abelian groups: Z_8, Z_4 x Z_2, Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2\n   - For 3^2, there are 3 possible abelian groups: Z_9, Z_3 x Z_3, and Z_3 x Z_3 x Z_3\n3. Multiply the number of groups for each prime factor: 4 * 3 = 12\n\nHowever, this does not include the trivial group (the group with only one element) and the group isomorphic to Z_72, which is not structurally distinct. Therefore, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 10",
