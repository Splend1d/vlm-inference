            "content": "A city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the singing and chanting of songs from 1:00P. M. to 1:00A. M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, \"We're number 1. . . we're number 1. \" One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?\n\nA. The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.\nB. The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.\nC. The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.\nD. The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\n",

            "content": "The students' weakest argument against the enforcement of the city ordinance would be that it deprives them of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. While the ordinance does restrict their freedom of expression by prohibiting certain types of singing and chanting, it does not violate the First Amendment because it is not a law of general applicability, but rather a specific regulation of noise. The ordinance is also not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because it does not discriminate against or deprive any person of equal protection under the law.\n\nThe ordinance is related to a legitimate community interest, as it is designed to prevent noise disturbances that could disturb the peace and quiet of residents. The ordinance is also not vague or overbroad, as it clearly defines the types of singing and chanting that are prohibited.\n\nThe students' argument that the ordinance deprives them of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing is also not a valid argument. The ordinance exempts religious singing from its purview, which means that it does not discriminate against religious singing.\n\nTherefore, the students' weakest argument against the enforcement of the city ordinance is that it deprives them of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
