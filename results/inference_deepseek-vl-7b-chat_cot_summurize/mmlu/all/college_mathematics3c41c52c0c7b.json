            "content": "The number of abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism is determined by the number of partitions of n. The partitions of n are the ways to write n as a sum of positive integers. For example, the partitions of 4 are {4}, {3, 1}, {2, 2}, {2, 1, 1}, and {1, 1, 1, 1}.\n\nThe number of abelian groups of order n is equal to the number of partitions of n. This is because each partition corresponds to a unique abelian group structure. For example, the partition {4} corresponds to the cyclic group of order 4, {3, 1} corresponds to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, and so on.\n\nTo find the number of abelian groups of order n, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of abelian groups of order n = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2\n\nFor n = 4, the formula gives us:\n\nNumber of abelian groups of order 4 = (4 + 1) * (4 + 2) / 2 = 5 * 6 / 2 = 15\n\nHowever, this formula only gives us the number of abelian groups of order n, not the number of abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism. To find the number of abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism, we need to consider the number of abelian groups of order n that are isomorphic to each other.\n\nFor n = 4, there are 15 abelian groups of order 4, but only 12 of them are isomorphic to each other. Therefore, there are exactly two abelian groups of order 4 up to isomorphism.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 12",
