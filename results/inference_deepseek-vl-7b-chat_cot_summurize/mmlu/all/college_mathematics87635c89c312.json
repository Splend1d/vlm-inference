            "content": "To determine the number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. For a tree with 5 vertices, there must be exactly one vertex with a degree of 1 (i.e., it has no children). This is because a tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and the only way to form a tree with 5 vertices is by having one vertex with a degree of 1.\n\n2. The remaining 4 vertices must have a degree of 2. This is because, in a tree, each vertex must have the same number of children, and since there is one vertex with a degree of 1, the remaining 4 vertices must have a degree of 2 each.\n\n3. Now, we can use the concept of combinations to determine the number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices. We have 4 vertices with a degree of 2, and we need to choose 2 of them to be connected to the vertex with a degree of 1. This can be done in C(4,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4.",
