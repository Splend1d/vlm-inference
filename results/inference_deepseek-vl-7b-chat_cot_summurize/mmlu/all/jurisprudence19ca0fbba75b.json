Hobbes' argument in \"Leviathan\" is that humans, being social creatures, enter into a social contract to establish a civil society to protect their lives and liberties. However, this contract cannot be formed unless there is peace, as war and conflict would prevent individuals from agreeing to cooperate with one another. Therefore, peace is the first law of nature because it is necessary for the establishment of the social contract.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The social contract cannot be entered into unless there is peace.",
