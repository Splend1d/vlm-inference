Which of the following makes the same logical mistake as above?\n\nA. Literature and art are not worthy of attention. Modernization must relies on science and technology, so science and technology are worthy of our attention. But literature and art are not science and technology.\nB. Non-university can also become an outstanding talent. Gorky, Edison, Faraday, Franklin, etc. have not attended college, but they have all become outstanding talents.\nC. The earth is a sphere, which can be proved from the fact that when we stand at a height and watch the sailing boat in the sea, we always see the mast first and then the hull. The reason for this is because the earth is a sphere.\nD. I saw them coming out of this chemical plant several times before I realized that this young man who was eager to help patients was originally a worker in this chemical plant.\n",

It is simply stating a fact and then drawing a conclusion based on that fact. There is no assumption or incorrect logic involved.\n\nB. This option is not making a logical mistake either. It is using a counterexample to show that non-university education can also lead to outstanding talent. There is no assumption or incorrect logic involved.\n\nC. This option is not making a logical mistake. It is using a real-world observation to support a conclusion about the shape of the Earth. There is no assumption or incorrect logic involved.\n\nD. This option is making the same logical mistake as the original statement. It assumes that because the traitor is a traitor, the speaker must also be a traitor, based on the transitive property of equality. This is a logical fallacy because the transitive property of equality does not hold in this context.
