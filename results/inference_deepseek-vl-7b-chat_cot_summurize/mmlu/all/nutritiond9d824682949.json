However, it's important to note that the specific types of EDs have varied in their trends. For example, anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) have seen a decrease in their overall prevalence, while binge eating disorder (BED) has increased.\n\nB. AN has the highest mortality across all mental disorders\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate. While anorexia nervosa does have a high mortality rate, it is not the highest among all mental disorders. In fact, some studies suggest that the mortality rate for individuals with AN is lower than that of individuals with certain other mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.\n\nC. BED occurs exclusively in obese subjects\n\nThis statement is also not accurate. BED can occur in individuals of any body weight, not just those who are obese. While it is true that some individuals with BED are obese, it is not a requirement for the disorder.\n\nD. Individuals with BN are predominantly impulsive and have comorbid borderline personality disorder\n\nThis statement is also not entirely accurate. While individuals with BN may have impulsive behaviors, it is not a defining characteristic of the disorder. Additionally, while it is common for individuals with BN to have comorbid borderline personality disorder, it is not a requirement for the disorder.",
