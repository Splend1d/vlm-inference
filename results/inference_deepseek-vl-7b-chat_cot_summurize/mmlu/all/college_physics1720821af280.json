            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the speed of sound, frequency, and temperature. The speed of sound is inversely proportional to the temperature, meaning that as the temperature decreases, the speed of sound decreases, and vice versa.\n\nLet's denote the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C as S0 and the speed of sound at the cold day as S. We are given that the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C, so we can write:\n\nS = S0 * (1 - 0.03)\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the frequency of resonance:\n\nf = (v / 2L)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound, L is the length of the pipe, and the frequency is directly proportional to the speed of sound.\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the frequency is 440 Hz, so we can write:\n\n440 = (S0 / 2L)\n\nAt the cold day, the speed of sound is 3 percent lower, so we can write:\n\nS = S0 * (1 - 0.03)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of S and S0 into the equation for frequency:\n\n440 = (S / 2L)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n440 = (S0 * (1 - 0.03) / 2L)\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\n2L = 440 * (1 - 0.03) / S0\n\nL = 440 * (1 - 0.03) / (440 * (1 - 0.03) / S0)\n\nL = S0\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of L into the equation for frequency:\n\n440 = (S / 2S0)\n\n440 = (S / 2 * S0)\n\n440 = (S / 2)\n\nNow, we can solve for S:\n\nS = 440 * 2\n\nS = 880\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of S into the equation for frequency:\n\n440 = (880 / 2L)\n\n440 = 440\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\nL = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of L into the equation for frequency:\n\n440 = (880 / 2)\n\n440 = 440\n\nNow, we can solve for f:\n\nf = (880 / 2)\n\nf = 440\n\nSo, the pipe resonates at a frequency of 440 Hz on the cold day.
