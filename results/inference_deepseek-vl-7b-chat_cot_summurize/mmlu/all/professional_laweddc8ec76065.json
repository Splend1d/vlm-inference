After receiving the letter, the woman sent the man a fax that stated, \"The price is a little high, I'll give you $800. \" The man responded by fax, \"I will not accept $800. \" The next day, the woman telephoned the man and said, \"I changed my mind, I will pay $1,000 for the motorcycle. \" The man refused to sell the woman his motorcycle. If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?\n\nA. Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\nB. The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.\nC. The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\nD. The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n",

Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\n\nThe man's best defense would be that the woman's acceptance was not in the same form as the original offer, which was written. According to the statute of frauds, a contract cannot be enforced if it is not in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Since the woman's acceptance was oral and not in writing, the man could argue that the contract is unenforceable under the statute of frauds.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the statute of frauds only applies to contracts that cannot be performed within one year. The sale of a motorcycle is a transaction that can be performed within one year, so the statute of frauds would not apply.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the woman's counter offer did not terminate her power of acceptance. The power of acceptance is not terminated until the other party rejects the offer. In this case, the man did not reject the woman's counter offer, so her power of acceptance remained intact.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the man's rejection of the woman's counter offer did not terminate the woman's power of acceptance. The power of acceptance is not terminated until the other party rejects the offer. In this case, the man did not reject the woman's counter offer, so her power of acceptance remained intact.",
