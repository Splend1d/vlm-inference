To find the number of excess electrons, we need to determine the number of electrons in the neutral atom of the element and then subtract 1.\n\nFor most elements, the number of electrons in the neutral atom is equal to the atomic number. However, for some elements, the number of electrons is slightly more than the atomic number due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the outermost shell.\n\nFor hydrogen (atomic number 1), the number of electrons in the neutral atom is 1.
