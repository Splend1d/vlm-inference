Let Boolean random variable D mean a patient \u201chas disease D\u201d and let Boolean random variable TP stand for \"tests positive.\" Tests for disease D are known to be very accurate in the sense that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, and the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97. What is P(TP), the prior probability of testing positive.\n\nA. 0.0368\nB. 0.473\nC. 0.078\nD. None of the above\n",

Bayes' theorem states that:\n\nP(TP|D) = P(D|TP) * P(TP) / P(D)\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\nP(D) = 0.05 (incidence of disease D)\nP(TP|D) = 0.99 (probability of testing positive given disease D)\nP(D|TP) = 1 - P(TP|D) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 (probability of having disease D given testing positive)\nP(TP) = ?\n\nWe can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(TP) = P(D|TP) * P(TP) / P(D)\nP(TP) = 0.01 * P(TP) / 0.05\n\nNow, we can solve for P(TP):\n\nP(TP) = 0.01 / 0.05 = 0.2\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options.
