The multiplier effect is the ratio of the initial increase in income to the final increase in income. In this case, the initial increase in income is $500, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.\n\nThe multiplier effect can be calculated as:\n\nMultiplier effect = (Initial increase in income) / (Final increase in income)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nMultiplier effect = $500 / (0.8 * $500)\n\nMultiplier effect = $500 / $400\n\nMultiplier effect = 1.25\n\nSo, the largest total increase in GDP that can result from $500 of new spending is 1.25 times the initial increase in income. To find the final increase in GDP, we multiply the initial increase in income by the multiplier effect:\n\nFinal increase in GDP = Initial increase in income * Multiplier effect\n\nFinal increase in GDP = $500 * 1.25\n\nFinal increase in GDP = $625\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $625.",
