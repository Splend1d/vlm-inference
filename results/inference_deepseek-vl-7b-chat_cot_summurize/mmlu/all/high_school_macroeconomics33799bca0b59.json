The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nWhen the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, it means that the same level of aggregate demand now requires a higher price level to be satisfied. This is because the new equilibrium price level is higher than the old one. At the new equilibrium price level, the quantity of output demanded by the market will be lower than before, as firms will produce less to match the higher price level. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity of output will decrease.",
