By definition, a free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements with the property that every element in the group can be written as a finite linear combination of these generators. If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then it must also be free abelian, because it can be generated by the same set of generators as the original group.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian.\n\nThis statement is false. The quotient group G / K is not necessarily free abelian. The group G / K is free abelian if and only if K is a normal subgroup of G. However, this is not always the case. For example, consider the group Z (the integers under addition) and its subgroup Z / 2Z (the integers modulo 2). The quotient group Z / 2Z is not free abelian, because it is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
