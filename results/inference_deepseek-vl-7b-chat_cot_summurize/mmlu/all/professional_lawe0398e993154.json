            "content": "A suspected drug dealer was arrested after selling three grams of cocaine to undercover police agents. He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of\n\nA. both indictments.\nB. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.\nC. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\nD. neither of the indictments.\n",

            "content": "Double jeopardy is a legal principle that protects individuals from being tried for the same crime more than once. In this case, the drug dealer has already been convicted and sentenced for possession with intent to distribute narcotics in state court. The new indictments for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine are essentially the same crime, so they would be considered double jeopardy.\n\nTherefore, the drug dealer's attorney's motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy would likely be successful. This would mean that the drug dealer would not be tried again for the same crime in either the state or federal court.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. both indictments.",
