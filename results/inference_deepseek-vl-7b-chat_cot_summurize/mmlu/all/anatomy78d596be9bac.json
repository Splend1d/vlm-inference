The Gastroesophageal sphincter is a muscular ring located at the junction of the esophagus (food pipe) and the stomach. It opens to allow food to enter the stomach and then closes to prevent the backflow of stomach contents into the esophagus. Bile, produced by the liver, is secreted into the small intestine (duodenum) through the bile ducts and is stored in the gallbladder. When food enters the stomach, the gallbladder releases bile into the duodenum to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins.",
