            "content": "A fifteen year-old boy was arrested for burglary. At a juvenile hearing, there was some circumstantial evidence presented but no direct evidence or eyewitness testimony. The juvenile court judge found the youth guilty and sentenced him to five years in a detention center. The juvenile's lawyer objected that the evidence did not prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but the judge held that such proof was not required in a juvenile proceeding. Will the state's appellate court affirm the ruling of the juvenile court judge?\n\nA. Yes, a juvenile does not get all of the rights enjoyed by adults and proof does not have to be beyond a reasonable doubt.\nB. No, a juvenile cannot be convicted of a crime in a juvenile proceeding except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, the reasonable doubt standard does not in any event rise to a constitutional right under our system in which each state can declare its own constitutional mandates.\nD. No, a juvenile court proceeding is always followed by a de novo proceeding in adult court in which the reasonable doubt standard is guaranteed.\n",
