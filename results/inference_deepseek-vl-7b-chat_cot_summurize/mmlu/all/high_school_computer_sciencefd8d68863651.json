Changing line 7 to a \u2190 b + 10 will NOT affect the results when the code segment is executed.\n\nThis is because the value of 'a' is determined in the first IF statement (Line 1). If 'a' is equal to 0, then 'b' is assigned the value of 'a' + 10 (Line 3). If 'a' is not equal to 0, then 'b' is assigned the value of 'a' + 20 (Line 7).\n\nChanging line 7 to a \u2190 b + 10 will not affect the results because 'a' is already determined in the first IF statement (Line 1). Changing line 7 to a \u2190 b + 10 will not change the value of 'a' in the first IF statement, and therefore will not affect the results of the code segment.",
