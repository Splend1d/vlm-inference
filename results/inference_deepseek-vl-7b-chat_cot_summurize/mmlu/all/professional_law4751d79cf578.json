A contractor who was unaware of the fee requirement agreed to perform home repairs for a city resident. After the contractor completed the work, the resident discovered that the contractor had not paid the licensing fee, and she refused to pay for the repairs, which were otherwise satisfactory. If the contractor sues the resident for breach of contract, how is the court likely to rule?\n\nA. Although the contract violates the law and is void, the court will require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work accepted.\nB. Although the contract violates the law, the court will find that public policy does not bar enforcement of the contract, because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue.\nC. Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.\nD. Because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue, the court will find that the contract does not violate the law but will allow the contractor to recover his costs only.\n",

Although the contract violates the law and is void, the court will require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work accepted.\n\nThis is the correct answer because the contract is void due to the violation of the law, but the court will still require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work accepted. This is because the contractor performed the work and the work was satisfactory, so the homeowner should be held responsible for the reasonable value of the work.\n\nB. is incorrect because even though the contract violates the law, the court can still enforce it if public policy does not bar enforcement.\n\nC. is incorrect because the contract is not void because it violates the law, but because it is voidable.\n\nD. is incorrect because the purpose of the fee is not merely to raise revenue, but also to regulate the home-repair contractors who perform work within the city limits.",
