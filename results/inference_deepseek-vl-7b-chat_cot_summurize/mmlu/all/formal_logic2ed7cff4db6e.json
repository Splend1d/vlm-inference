The truth table will have 2^3 rows, where each row represents a possible combination of truth values for M, N, and O.\n\nHere is the truth table:\n\n| M | N | O | M \u2228 N | ~M \u00b7 O / N |\n|---|---|---|-------|-------------|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |   0   |     0       |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |   1   |     1       |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |   1   |     1       |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 |   0   |     0       |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |   1   |     1       |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |   0   |     0       |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |   0   |     0       |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |   1   |     0       |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table to determine the validity of the argument:\n\n1. M \u2228 N:\n- When M is true, M \u2228 N is true.\n- When M is false, M \u2228 N is true.\n- When N is true, M \u2228 N is true.\n- When N is false, M \u2228 N is true.\n\n2. ~M \u00b7 O / N:\n- When M is true, ~M \u00b7 O / N is false.\n- When M is false, ~M \u00b7 O / N is true.\n- When N is true, ~M \u00b7 O / N is false.\n- When N is false, ~M \u00b7 O / N is true.\n\nThe argument is valid because both M \u2228 N and ~M \u00b7 O / N are true for all possible combinations of truth values for M, N, and O.\n\nHowever, the question asks for a counterexample. One possible counterexample is when M is true, O is true, and N is false. In this case, M \u2228 N is true, but ~M \u00b7 O / N is false. This counterexample shows that the argument is not always true, even though it is valid.",
