The debtor wrote a letter to the creditor stating that he would pay the creditor $10,000 received from the proceeds of the sale of his house in payment of the discharged debt. One week later, the debtor learned that the person who had contracted to buy his house reneged on the deal. As a result, the debtor refused to pay anything to the creditor.

Since the sale did not go through, the debtor is not obligated to pay the creditor anything. Therefore, the creditor would not be entitled to recover any money from the debtor in a lawsuit for breach of contract.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. $10,000.00: This would be the amount the debtor promised to pay, but since the sale of the house did not occur, the debtor is not obligated to pay this amount.\n\nC. $10,000, only if the debtor is successful in suing the person who had contracted to buy his house: This option is not relevant to the question. The question is about the debtor's obligation to pay the creditor, not about the debtor's ability to recover money from someone else.\n\nD. $15,000.00: This would be the amount the creditor is owed, but since the debtor's bankruptcy discharged the debt, the creditor is not entitled to this amount.",
