The three given conditions can be represented as:\n\nx \u2261 1 (mod 4)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nx \u2261 2 (mod 5)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\nN1 = N/4 = 60/4 = 15\nN2 = N/3 = 60/3 = 20\nN3 = N/5 = 60/5 = 12\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n15 * x1 \u2261 1 (mod 4) => x1 \u2261 1 (mod 4)\n20 * x2 \u2261 1 (mod 3) => x2 \u2261 1 (mod 3)\n12 * x3 \u2261 1 (mod 5) => x3 \u2261 1 (mod 5)\n\nThe modular inverses are:\nx1 \u2261 1 (mod 4) => x1 = 1\nx2 \u2261 1 (mod 3) => x2 = 1\nx3 \u2261 1 (mod 5) => x3 = 1\n\nNow, we can find the solution x:\nx = (1 * 15 * 1) + (1 * 20 * 1) + (1 * 12 * 1) = 15 + 20 + 12 = 47\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the given conditions. We need to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the conditions.\n\nWe can start by checking the smallest positive integer that satisfies the first condition (x \u2261 1 (mod 4)):\n1 \u2261 1 (mod 4)\n\nNow, we check the second condition (x \u2261 1 (mod 3)):\n1 \u2261 1 (mod 3)\n\nFinally, we check the third condition (x \u2261 2 (mod 5)):\n1 \u2261 2 (mod 5)\n\nNone of the smallest positive integers satisfy all three conditions. Therefore, there is no smallest whole number that satisfies all three conditions.",
