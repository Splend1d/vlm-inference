We have 8 members in the theater group, and we need to choose 3 of them to play the roles of the female lead, male lead, and 3 different objects.\n\nFirst, we choose the female lead. There are 4 females, so there are 4 ways to choose the female lead.\n\nNext, we choose the male lead. There are 4 males, so there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n\nNow, we need to choose 3 objects out of the remaining 4 members (excluding the female lead and male lead). There are 4 ways to choose the first object, 3 ways to choose the second object, and 2 ways to choose the third object.\n\nUsing the multiplication principle, the total number of ways to assign the roles is:\n\n4 (ways to choose female lead) * 4 (ways to choose male lead) * 4 (ways to choose first object) * 3 (ways to choose second object) * 2 (ways to choose third object) = 640\n\nSo, there are 640 ways to assign the roles of the play.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 640.",
