So, the implication is true.\n   - When X is false, ~X is true, and ~Y is true. So, the implication is false.\n   - The implication is valid.\n\n2. Y \u2283 Z:\n   - When Y is true, Z is true. So, the implication is true.\n   - When Y is false, Z can be true or false. So, the implication is false.\n   - The implication is valid.\n\n3. ~Z / ~X:\n   - When Z is true, ~Z is false, and ~X is true. So, the implication is true.\n   - When Z is false, ~Z is true, and ~X is true. So, the implication is true.\n   - When X is true, ~X is false, and ~Z is true. So, the implication is false.\n   - When X is false, ~X is true, and ~Z is true. So, the implication is false.\n   - The implication is valid.\n\nSince all the implications in the argument are valid, the argument is valid. Therefore, the correct option is A. Valid.",
