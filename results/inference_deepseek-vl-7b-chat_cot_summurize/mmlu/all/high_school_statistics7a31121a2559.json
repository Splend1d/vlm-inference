If the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis at one significance level, it is also strong enough to reject it at a lower significance level. For example, if you have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% level, you would also have strong evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n\nB. Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nThis statement is false. The decision to use a one- or two-sided test should be made before the data are gathered. A one-sided test assumes that the alternative hypothesis is true, while a two-sided test assumes that the null hypothesis could be true or false.\n\nC. If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is false. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is not 1%, but rather the opposite of the significance level. For example, if you conduct a hypothesis test at the 1% level, there is a 99% chance of not rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nD. The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is false. The power of a test is its ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. It does not concern the ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.",
