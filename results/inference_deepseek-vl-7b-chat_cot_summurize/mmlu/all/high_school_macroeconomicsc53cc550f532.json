The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it means that the price level at which firms are willing to supply the same quantity of goods and services has decreased. This implies that for a given price level, firms are willing to supply fewer goods and services. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity of output will decrease. At the same time, the equilibrium price level will increase because there is a decrease in the quantity of output demanded at the same price level.",
