In 1960, the shopkeeper conveyed the property by general warranty deed as follows: \"The grantor hereby conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25. \" At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single. Thereafter, the sister married and had two sons. Subsequently, one son died in an automobile accident. Three years after that son's death, the sister had a daughter.

At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single, and she had two sons. One of the sons died in an automobile accident, and three years later, the sister had a daughter.\n\nSince the sister had two sons before the conveyance, the condition of the conveyance does not apply to them. The daughter was born after the death of the son, and she is not mentioned in the condition of the conveyance. Therefore, she is not entitled to any part of the property.\n\nThe friend is the only one who is entitled to the property because he is the one who was conveyed the property in the general warranty deed. The son and the daughter are not mentioned in the condition of the conveyance, and they are not entitled to any part of the property.\n\nTherefore, the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented are in the friend, the son, and the daughter.",
