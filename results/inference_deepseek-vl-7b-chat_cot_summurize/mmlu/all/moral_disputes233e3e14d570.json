Which of the following is part of his response?\n\nA. He would say this begs the question because the immigration question is identical to the freedom-of-movement question.\nB. He would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement.\nC. He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner).\nD. He would use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable.\n",

Therefore, option C, which suggests that he would argue that some rights are not absolute, seems to be the most appropriate answer. \n\nThis is because Wellman would need to show that the right to freedom of movement is not absolute, and therefore, it does not necessarily imply that we have a right to move wherever we want. This would help to counter the objection that he is denying the right to freedom of movement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
