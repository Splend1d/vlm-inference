If A and B are independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. This is the definition of independence in probability theory.\n\nB. A and B may or may not be mutually exclusive.\n\nThis statement is also true. Mutuality exclusivity means that the events A and B cannot both occur at the same time. If A and B are independent, they may or may not be mutually exclusive.\n\nC. A and B must be mutually exclusive.\n\nThis statement is false. Independence does not imply mutual exclusivity. Two events can be independent and still occur simultaneously.\n\nD. P(A|B) = P(B|A)\n\nThis statement is also false. The probability of A occurring given B (P(A|B)) is not necessarily equal to the probability of B occurring given A (P(B|A)). Independence does not imply that the conditional probabilities are equal.",
