            "content": "The Treaty of Versailles was never voted on by the United States Senate. The passage you provided is from Woodrow Wilson's Proclamation of Neutrality in 1914, which declared the United States' policy of remaining neutral in World War I. The Treaty of Versailles, which was signed in 1919, was the peace treaty that ended World War I and imposed harsh terms on Germany. However, the United States did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and it was never voted on by the Senate. The Senate did express reservations about the division of Eastern Europe in the treaty, but it did not reject it. The United States Senate did reject the Treaty of Versailles in 1921, but that was after the passage you provided and after the treaty had already been signed.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. It was never voted on by the United States Senate.",
