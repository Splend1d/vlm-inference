Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nThe system of labor described in the first passage came into being in which of the following ways?\n\nA. Spanish colonists enslaved native American populations outright.\nB. Spain refused to purchase slaves from Africa, relying instead on native American labor.\nC. Spanish authorities adapted local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes.\nD. Spanish landowners came to depend heavily on plantation monoculture.\n",

Spanish landowners came to depend heavily on plantation monoculture.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Spanish authorities adapted local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes.\n\nIn the passage, it is mentioned that \"His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians.\" This indicates that the Spanish authorities adapted the local form of labor mobilization, which was already in place for the payment of tribute to the Indians, for their own purposes of using the Indians for labor in the mercury mine.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention any enslavement of native American populations by Spanish colonists.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about Spain refusing to purchase slaves from Africa.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about plantation monoculture or Spanish landowners depending on it.",
