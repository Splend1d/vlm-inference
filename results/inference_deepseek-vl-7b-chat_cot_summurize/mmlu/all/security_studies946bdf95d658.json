A culture that exists some of the time, but not all the time, in which no self-restraint exists and actors cannot rely on each other for help.\nB. A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.\nC. A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security.\nD. A culture within which survival relies on military power, security dilemmas abound, and security is a zero-sum game.\n",
