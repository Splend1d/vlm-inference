The associate notes the number of customers whose names begin with A and uses a random number table to pick four of these names. She then proceeds to use the same procedure for each letter of the alphabet and combines the 4 \u00d7 26 = 104 results into a group to be contacted. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. Her procedure makes use of chance.\nB. Her procedure results in a simple random sample.\nC. Each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.\nD. Her procedure introduces bias through sampling error.\n",

            "content": "A. Her procedure makes use of chance.\n\nThe associate's procedure involves using a random number table to pick four names whose names begin with a certain letter of the alphabet. This is a random process, as the selection of names is not based on any systematic or predictable pattern, but rather on the chance of the names appearing in the random number table. Therefore, her procedure makes use of chance.\n\nB. Her procedure results in a simple random sample.\n\nA simple random sample is one in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. In this case, the associate is selecting customers based on the first letter of their names, which is not a systematic or predictable process. However, the selection is not truly random because it is based on the first letter of the name, which is not a complete random process. Therefore, her procedure does not result in a simple random sample.\n\nC. Each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.\n\nThe associate's procedure does not guarantee that each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey. The probability of a customer being selected depends on the first letter of their name, which is not an equal probability for all customers. Therefore, this statement is not correct.\n\nD. Her procedure introduces bias through sampling error.\n\nThe associate's procedure does introduce bias through sampling error. The bias is introduced because the selection of customers is not based on a complete random process, but rather on the first letter of their names. This means that some customers are more likely to be selected than others, depending on the first letter of their names. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nSo, the correct conclusions are A and D. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we need to choose the most accurate one. The most accurate conclusion is D, as it directly addresses the bias introduced by the sampling method used by the associate.",
