            "content": "To calculate Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost basis of the remaining shares after the stock split.\n2. Calculate the cost basis of the shares sold.\n3. Subtract the cost basis of the shares sold from the cost basis of the remaining shares to find the basis in the 800 shares sold.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost basis of the remaining shares after the stock split.\n- Lemon had 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n- In year 5, the stock split 2-for-1.\n- So, Lemon now has 2000 * 2 = 4000 shares.\n- The cost basis of the remaining shares is the original cost basis of 2000 shares divided by the new number of shares: (2000 * $10.50) / 4000 = $21.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cost basis of the shares sold.\n- Lemon sold 800 shares.\n- The cost basis of the shares sold is the cost basis of the remaining shares after the stock split: $21.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the basis in the 800 shares sold.\n- The basis in the 800 shares sold is the cost basis of the shares sold: $21.\n\nSo, Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold is $21.
