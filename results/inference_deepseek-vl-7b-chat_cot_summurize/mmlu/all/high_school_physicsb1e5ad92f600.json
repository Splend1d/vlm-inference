Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?\n\nA. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nB. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\nD.
