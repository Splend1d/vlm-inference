It has a process that extends upwards and forwards, which, when combined with the zygomatic bone, forms the zygomatic arch. The zygomatic arch is a bony structure that supports the cheek and provides attachment for several facial muscles.\n\nB. The temporal bone is part of the skull and is not involved in forming the zygomatic arch.\nC. The sphenoid bone is part of the skull's inner structure and is not involved in forming the zygomatic arch.\nD.
