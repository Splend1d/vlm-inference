Therefore, the sum of any two elements in S is congruent to 2 modulo 10.\n\nB. (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nThis statement is false. The set S is not closed under multiplication modulo 10. For example, 2 * 4 = 8, which is not congruent to 2 modulo 10.\n\nC. (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\n\nThis statement is true. The identity element under addition modulo 10 is 0, and all elements in S are congruent to 2 modulo 10. Therefore, the sum of any element in S with 0 is congruent to 2 modulo 10.\n\nD. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nThis statement is true. The set S is not closed under multiplication modulo 10, as shown in statement B. Therefore, it does not have an identity under multiplication modulo 10.",
