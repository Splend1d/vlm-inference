            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the total outward electric displacement (D) due to a surface charge density (\u03c3) on a surface of area (A):\n\nD = \u03c3 * A\n\nIn this case, the surface area (A) is the area of the cube, which is 10 m * 10 m = 100 m^2. The surface charge density (\u03c3) is given as 20 coulombs/m^2.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = 20 coulombs/m^2 * 100 m^2\n\nD = 2000 coulombs\n\nHowever, this is the total outward electric displacement due to the cube. We need to consider that the metal surface is also contributing to the total outward electric displacement. The metal surface has a radius of 1 meter, so its area is \u03c0 * (1 m)^2 = \u03c0 m^2. The surface charge density on the metal surface is the same as the surface charge density on the cube, which is 20 coulombs/m^2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the outward electric displacement due to the metal surface:\n\nD_metal = \u03c3_metal * A_metal\n\nD_metal = 20 coulombs/m^2 * \u03c0 m^2\n\nD_metal = 20\u03c0 coulombs\n\nFinally, we can add the outward electric displacement due to the cube and the metal surface to find the total outward electric displacement:\n\nD_total = D_cube + D_metal\n\nD_total = 2000 coulombs + 20\u03c0 coulombs\n\nD_total \u2248 2000 + 62.83 coulombs\n\nD_total \u2248 2062.83 coulombs\n\nSince 2062.83 is not an integer, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 2063 coulombs.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this result.
