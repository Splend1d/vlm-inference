            "content": "Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. This statement is true. In a group, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a is an element of the group, e is the identity element of the group, and ^ denotes the group operation. If an element has order 10, it means that a^10 = e, and a^2 = a, a^4 = e, and a^5 = e. Therefore, the group has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6. This statement is false. In a group, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a is an element of the group, e is the identity element of the group, and ^ denotes the group operation. If an element has order 2, it means that a^2 = e, and a^1 = a. If an element has order 3, it means that a^3 = e, and a^1 = a. However, there is no guarantee that the product of two elements of order 2 and 3 will have order 6. For example, consider the group of integers under addition modulo 4. In this group, the elements of order 2 are 0 and 2, and the element of order 3 is 1. The product of these elements, 0*2*1 = 0, does not have order 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
