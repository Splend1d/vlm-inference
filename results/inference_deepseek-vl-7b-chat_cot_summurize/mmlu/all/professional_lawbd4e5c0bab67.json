            "content": "Within the last two years, the number of cases coming before the U. S. Supreme Court has quadrupled. Because of this increased work load, the Court has complained that it is unable to properly review all of its cases. As a consequence, Congress formed a committee to conduct a study on improving the functioning and operation of the Court. Based on the committee's recommendations, Congress enacted a statute dividing the Court into two panels. One panel would be assigned to handle criminal cases exclusively, while the other panel would handle all non-criminal matters. Each panel would be composed of four associate justices and a chief justice. According to the new law, the decisions of each panel would be final and not reviewable by any other court or judiciary. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute?\n\nA. The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.\nB. The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.\nC. Based on the doctrine ofjudicial supremacy, Congress does not have authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\nD. Based on the separate sovereignty doctrine, Congress does not have authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court.\n",

            "content": "The strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute would be that it contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court. The Constitution establishes a single Supreme Court with the power to hear cases and make decisions on matters of national importance. The statute in question, however, divides the Court into two panels, each with its own jurisdiction and decision-making authority. This effectively creates two separate courts within the Supreme Court, which is a direct violation of the single-court requirement established in the Constitution.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the constitutionality of the statute. Option B concerns the enumerated powers of Congress and the necessity of the statute for those powers, which is not directly related to the constitutionality of the statute itself. Option C discusses the doctrine of judicial supremacy, which is not directly applicable to the division of the Supreme Court into two panels. Option D, the separate sovereignty doctrine, also does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nTherefore, the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute is that it contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.",
