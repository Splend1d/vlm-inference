            "content": "To find the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) for the weights of trucks traveling on the interstate system, we can use the following formula:\n\n\u03bc = (n * \u03a3x) / N\n\u03c3 = \u221a(n * \u03a3(x - \u03bc)^2 / N)\n\nwhere:\n- \u03bc is the mean\n- \u03a3x is the sum of the weights of the trucks\n- N is the total number of trucks\n- n is the number of trucks in each weight bin\n- x is the weight of each truck\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of trucks in each weight bin. We know that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds. Let's assume that the weights are evenly distributed between these two bins.\n\nLet x1 be the weight of the truck in the first bin (10,000 - 12,000 pounds), and let x2 be the weight of the truck in the second bin (12,000 - 14,900 pounds). Then, the number of trucks in each bin is:\n\nn1 = (70/100) * N\nn2 = (80/100) * N\n\nNow, we can find the mean and standard deviation for each bin:\n\nMean (\u03bc) for the first bin:\n\u03bc1 = (n1 * x1) / N\n\u03bc1 = (70/100) * N * (10,000 - 12,000) / N\n\u03bc1 = (70/100) * N * (-2,000) / N\n\u03bc1 = -1400\n\nMean (\u03bc) for the second bin:\n\u03bc2 = (n2 * x2) / N\n\u03bc2 = (80/100) * N * (12,000 - 14,900) / N\n\u03bc2 = (80/100) * N * (-2,900) / N\n\u03bc2 = -2320\n\nNow, we can find the mean for the entire system:\n\n\u03bc = (n1 * \u03bc1 + n2 * \u03bc2) / N\n\u03bc = (70/100) * N * (-1400) + (80/100) * N * (-2320) / N\n\u03bc = (-1400 + -2320) / N\n\u03bc = -3720 / N\n\nSince we don't have the total number of trucks (N), we cannot find the exact mean (\u03bc). However, we can find the standard deviation (\u03c3) for each bin:\n\nStandard deviation (\u03c3) for the first bin:\n\u03c31 = \u221a(n1 * \u03a3(x1 - \u03bc1)^2 / N)\n\u03c31 = \u221a(70/100 * N * \u03a3(x1 - (-1400))^2 / N)\n\nStandard deviation (\u03c3) for the second bin:\n\u03c32 = \u221a(n2 * \u03a3(x2 - \u03bc2)^2 / N)\n\u03c32 = \u221a(80/100 * N * \u03a3(x2 - (-2320))^2 / N)\n\nSince we don't have the sum of the weights of the trucks (\u03a3x), we cannot find the exact standard deviation (\u03c3) for each bin. However, we can find the standard deviation for the entire system:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(n1 * \u03a3(x1 - \u03bc1)^2 / N + n2 * \u03a3(x2 - \u03bc2)^2 / N)\n\nWithout the total number of trucks (N) and the sum of the weights of the trucks (\u03a3x), we cannot find the exact mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) for the weights of trucks traveling on the interstate system.",
