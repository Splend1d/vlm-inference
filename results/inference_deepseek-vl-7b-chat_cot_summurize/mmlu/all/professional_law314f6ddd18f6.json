Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?\n\nA. The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\nB. The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\nC. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest.\nD. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n",
