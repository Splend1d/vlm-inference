            "content": "A toy collector had purchased 10 antique toys over the last several years and had had them restored by an expert in toy restoration. On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: \"Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more.\" On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\nC. Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\nD. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n",

This note can be considered an offer to the expert. The expert began restoring the toy on June 4, which can be considered an acceptance of the offer. The collector's death on June 6 does not affect the validity of the contract, as the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death. Therefore, the contract is valid and binding between the expert and the collector's estate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the collector's death does not invalidate the contract.\nOption B is incorrect because the offer did not lapse when the collector died.\nOption C is incorrect because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death, which means the contract was already in place.\nOption D is correct because the offer was accepted before the collector's death, and the contract is valid and binding between the expert and the collector's estate.",
