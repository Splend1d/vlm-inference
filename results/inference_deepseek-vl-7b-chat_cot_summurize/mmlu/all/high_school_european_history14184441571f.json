This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\n\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC. Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\nD. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n",

            "content": "The biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans is that Calvinists believed in the doctrine of predestination, which is the belief that God has predetermined who will be saved and who will not, while Lutherans believed in the doctrine of justification by faith alone, which is the belief that salvation comes through faith in Christ alone, regardless of one's inherent worth or actions. This difference in belief has significant implications for how Calvinists and Lutherans understand the role of human free will and the nature of God's grace.",
