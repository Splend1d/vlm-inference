Since the data is normally distributed, the median is the mean (25).\n\n2. Next, find the first quartile (Q1). Since the data is normally distributed, Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data. The lower half of the data is from the mean minus 1 standard deviation to the mean minus 2 standard deviations. So, Q1 = 25 - 4 = 21.\n\n3. Finally, find the third quartile (Q3). Since the data is normally distributed, Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data. The upper half of the data is from the mean plus 1 standard deviation to the mean plus 2 standard deviations. So, Q3 = 25 + 4 = 29.\n\n4. Now, we can find the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 29 - 21 = 8.\n\nSo, the approximate interquartile range for this distribution is 8.00, which corresponds to option D.",
