            "content": "The separation of the bright fringes is determined by the wavelength of the light, not the frequency. The relationship between the separation of the fringes, the distance between the slits, and the wavelength of the light is given by:\n\nd = (\u03bb * sin(\u03b8)) / (2 * d)\n\nwhere d is the separation of the bright fringes, \u03bb is the wavelength of the light, \u03b8 is the angle between the light and the slits, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nIn this problem, the separation of the bright fringes is given as 1.0 mm, the distance between the slits is 0.5 mm, and the wavelength of the light is doubled. Therefore, the new wavelength of the light is 2 * \u03bb.\n\nSince the angle \u03b8 is not given, we cannot find the exact value of the new separation of the bright fringes. However, we can express it in terms of the original wavelength:\n\nd = (2 * \u03bb * sin(\u03b8)) / (2 * 0.5)\n\nd = (2 * \u03bb * sin(\u03b8)) / 1\n\nd = \u03bb * sin(\u03b8)\n\nSince the wavelength of the light is doubled, the new separation of the bright fringes will be twice the original separation:\n\nd = 2 * 1.0 mm = 2.0 mm\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 2.0 mm.",
