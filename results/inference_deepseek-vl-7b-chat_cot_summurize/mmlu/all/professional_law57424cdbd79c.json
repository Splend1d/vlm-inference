            "content": "A man and a woman were passengers on a plane. They were seated next to one another in the first- class section of the plane. Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband. She proposed to testify that the man confided to her that he did steal the woman's money during the flight. The man's attorney objected on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. The wife's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.\nC. inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.\nD. inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n",

            "content": "The wife's proposed testimony is inadmissible because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception. \n\nThe husband's attorney's objection is based on both grounds. Privileged communication refers to any statement made in confidence that is not admissible as evidence against the person who made the statement. In this case, the wife's testimony would be privileged because she is the husband's wife and the communication was made in confidence. \n\nHearsay, on the other hand, refers to a statement made out of court that is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the wife's testimony would be hearsay because she is not testifying about what the husband said to her, but rather what he did. \n\nSince the wife's testimony discloses a privileged communication and is also hearsay not within any recognized exception, it is inadmissible. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",
