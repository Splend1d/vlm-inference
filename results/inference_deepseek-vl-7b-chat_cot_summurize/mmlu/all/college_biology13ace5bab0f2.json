            "content": "A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock. The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is B. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\n\nExplanation: According to the theory, the exposure of pollen grains to water precipitates the release of starch granules due to osmotic shock. Osmotic shock occurs when the osmotic pressure of a solution is increased, causing water to move into the solution from the surrounding environment. In this case, the surrounding environment would have a lower osmotic pressure than the interior of the pollen grains, which would have a higher osmotic pressure. This difference in osmotic pressure would cause water to move from the surrounding environment into the pollen grains, leading to the release of starch granules and potentially triggering an asthmatic attack.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the interior of the pollen grains would not be hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment; it would have a higher osmotic pressure.\n\nOption C is incorrect because plasmolysis, which is the process by which a cell loses water due to a decrease in osmotic pressure, would occur in the pollen grains before they release their contents.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the pollen grains would not undergo shrinking before they released their contents; rather, they would rupture due to the increased osmotic pressure.",
