Electron affinity is a measure of the energy released when an electron is added to an atom.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide the electron affinity values for these atoms without additional information. Please provide the electron affinity values for each of the given atoms, and I will be able to compare them and determine which has the lowest electron affinity.",
