            "content": "Fifteen years ago, two men who were fishing buddies moved onto vacant rural land owned by a woman they didn't know and built a small fishing shack on it. Twelve years ago, the men replaced the shack with a fish processing plant and a commercial fishing boat dock. The men maintained their commercial fishery operation on the land until one of them died intestate last year, leaving a sole heir. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The woman has now become aware of the changes that have occurred on the land. In an action to determine title, for whom should the court decide?\n\nA. For the man who is still alive and the deceased man's heir, because the men acquired title as tenants in common.\nB. For the man who is still alive, because he is the surviving adverse possessor.\nC. For the woman, because the use was changed by the men while they were in possession.\nD. For the woman, because title cannot be claimed by two adverse possessors simultaneously.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. For the man who is still alive and the deceased man's heir, because the men acquired title as tenants in common.\n\nThe reason for this is that the men were both tenants in common when they acquired title to the land. This means that they held the land as joint tenants, with each owning an equal share of the property. When one of them died, his share of the property would pass to his heir, who would then become the sole owner of the property.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. For the man who is still alive, because he is the surviving adverse possessor: This is incorrect because the period of time to acquire title by adverse possession is 10 years, and the men had been in possession for 15 years before the woman became aware of the changes.\n\nC. For the woman, because the use was changed by the men while they were in possession: This is incorrect because the use of the land was not changed by the men, but rather they built a fish processing plant and a commercial fishing boat dock on the land.\n\nD. For the woman, because title cannot be claimed by two adverse possessors simultaneously: This is incorrect because the men were not adverse possessors, but rather tenants in common. As such, they could both claim title to the land.",
