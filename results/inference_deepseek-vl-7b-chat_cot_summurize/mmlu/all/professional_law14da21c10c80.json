No the seller must return the down payment because the minor has declared his disaffirmance of the contract.\n\nThe minor's age and appearance may have misled the seller into believing that the minor was of legal age to enter into the contract. However, the minor's disaffirmance of the contract means that he is not bound by the agreement. As a result, the seller is not entitled to any consideration from the minor, and must return the down payment.",
