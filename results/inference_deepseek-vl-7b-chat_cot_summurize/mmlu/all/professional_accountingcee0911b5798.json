Summer had no taxable income from that year until the current year. In the current year, Summer has gross income of $80,000 and sustains another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock. Assuming that Summer can carry the entire $20,000 net operating loss to the current year, what is the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year?\n\nA. $35,000 ordinary loss.\nB. $35,000 capital loss.\nC. $50,000 ordinary loss.\nD. $50,000 capital loss.\n",

            "content": "To determine the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the amount of the net operating loss (NOL) from three years ago.\n2. Determine the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss from three years ago.\n3. Determine the amount of the NOL carried forward from three years ago.\n4. Determine the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss carried forward from three years ago.\n5. Calculate the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss that can be deducted for the current year.\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of the NOL from three years ago.\nSummer had a net operating loss of $20,000 three years ago.\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss from three years ago.\nA Code Sec. 1244 stock loss made up three-fourths of that loss. Therefore, the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss from three years ago is (3/4) * $20,000 = $15,000.\n\nStep 3: Determine the amount of the NOL carried forward from three years ago.\nThe NOL from three years ago is $20,000.\n\nStep 4: Determine the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss carried forward from three years ago.\nThe Code Sec. 1244 stock loss from three years ago is $15,000.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss that can be deducted for the current year.\nSummer can carry the entire $20,000 NOL to the current year. Therefore, the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss that can be deducted for the current year is $15,000.\n\nSince the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss is a capital loss, the answer is:\n\nD. $50,000 capital loss.",
