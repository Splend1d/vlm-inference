Since the car starts from rest, it will initially accelerate for a short period of time before reaching a speed of 5 m/s. The actual time it takes for the car to cover the entire distance of 200 m will be slightly longer than 40 s.\n\nTo find the actual time, we can use the following formula:\n\ntime = (2 * initial acceleration * distance) / (final velocity - initial velocity)\n\nIn this case, the initial acceleration is 5 m/s^2, the distance is 200 m, and the final velocity is 5 m/s. Plugging in the values:\n\ntime = (2 * 5 m/s^2 * 200 m) / (5 m/s - 0 m/s) = 200 s\n\nHowever, this is the time it takes for the car to reach a speed of 5 m/s.
