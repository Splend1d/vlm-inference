We need to find the value of x when f(2x) = 6.\n\nf(2x) = 6\n2x + 5 = 6\n2x = 1\nx = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of g(6). We are given that f(g(6)) = 13. We need to find the value of x when f(g(6)) = 13.\n\nf(g(6)) = 13\nf(2(1/2)) = 13\nf(1) = 13\n\nNow, we know that f(1) = 1 + 5 = 6.\n\nFinally, we need to find the value of 2 * g(6).\n\n2 * g(6) = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nSo, the answer is 2 * g(6) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 36.",
