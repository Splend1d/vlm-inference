Both expressions result in the same value for any value of x, as long as x is greater than zero.\n\nB. 4d+ 2e and 8d+e\n\nThese expressions are not equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. The first expression has a coefficient of 4, while the second has a coefficient of 8. The difference in coefficients means that the two expressions will not always result in the same value for any value of d and e.\n\nC. f+f+f+g and 3fg\n\nThese expressions are not equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. The first expression has four terms, while the second has only two terms. The difference in the number of terms means that the two expressions will not always result in the same value for any value of f and g.\n\nD. b+b+3c and 2b+ 3c\n\nThese expressions are not equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. The first expression has a coefficient of 1, while the second has a coefficient of 2. The difference in coefficients means that the two expressions will not always result in the same value for any value of b and c.",
