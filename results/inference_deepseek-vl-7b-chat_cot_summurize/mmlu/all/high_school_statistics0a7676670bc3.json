This means that the proportion of visitors shopping at the store is greater than 60 percent, not equal to or less than 60 percent.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the claim is that over 60 percent of the mall's visitors shop at the store, not that the proportion is exactly 0.60.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the claim is that over 60 percent of the mall's visitors shop at the store, not that the proportion is less than 60 percent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the claim is that over 60 percent of the mall's visitors shop at the store, not that the proportion is equal to 0.60.",
