            "content": "The question presents a scenario where an employee saves his boss's life by performing CPR after finding him not breathing. The boss, grateful for the employee's quick action, promises the employee a job for life. The question asks which of the given options best characterizes the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The boss's oral promise is not necessarily enforceable as a lifetime employment contract. An employment contract typically requires a written agreement and consideration, which is not provided in this scenario.\n\nB. The boss does have a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, based on a contract implied-in-fact. An implied-in-fact contract is created when one party performs a service for another party, and the promise of future employment can be considered a form of compensation.\n\nC. The employee's act of saving the boss's life is not sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise. The promise of lifetime employment is not supported by the employee's act of saving the boss's life, as it is not a legally binding consideration.\n\nD. Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there is insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment. The employee's act of saving the boss's life is not a legally binding consideration, and therefore, the promise of lifetime employment is not enforceable.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best characterization of the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date is option B. The boss has a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, based on a contract implied-in-fact.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
