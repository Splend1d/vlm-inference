            "content": "A state legislature passed a law requiring state universities to have male and female students live in separate dormitory facilities. The law was passed in order to curtail the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. Two students at a state university are engaged to be married and wish to share a dormitory room together. Citing the law, university housing officials refuse to allow them to live together in a campus dormitory facility. The students bring an appropriate action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Which of the following correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion?\n\nA. Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nB. Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nC. Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.\nD. Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\n\nThe law in question is about the right of privacy, specifically the right of students to choose their living arrangements. The state legislature has passed a law that infringes on this right, and the students are challenging its constitutionality. In such cases, the state must show that the law furthers a compelling state interest.\n\nA compelling state interest is an interest that is of such a nature that the state's action is necessary to protect it. In this case, the state's interest is in curtailing co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. However, the state's interest is not compelling because it is not necessary to protect the state's interest by infringing on the students' right to privacy. There are other ways to achieve the state's interest, such as providing separate facilities for male and female students or providing education and counseling to students about sexual health and relationships.\n\nTherefore, the state must show that the law furthers a compelling state interest. If the state cannot show this, the law would be considered unconstitutional.",
