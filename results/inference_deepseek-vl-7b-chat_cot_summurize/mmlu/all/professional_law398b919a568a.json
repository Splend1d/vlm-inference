The drug dealer was always late, so the victim continued to wait outside in the freezing cold weather because he needed a quick fix. Suddenly a car rounded the street corner and a shot rang out. The victim slumped over and fell to the sidewalk. Immediately after being shot and before he died, the victim exclaimed, \"The defendant did it!\" The defendant was indicted and is now on trial for the victim's murder. Based on these facts alone, the admissibility of the victim's statement should be determined by\n\nA. the jury, after a preliminary determination by the judge.\nB. the jury, without a preliminary determination by the judge.\nC. the judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the dying declaration if it determines that the victim knew he was dying.\nD. the judge, without assistance from the jury.\n",

            "content": "The victim's statement should be admissible in court, as it meets the criteria for a dying declaration. A dying declaration is a statement made by a person who is about to die, and it is generally admissible in court if the person making the statement knew they were about to die and the statement is made in response to an unlawful act.\n\nIn this case, the victim was shot and killed while making a drug buy, so it can be inferred that he knew he was about to die. His statement, \"The defendant did it!\" can be considered a dying declaration, and it should be admissible in court.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the dying declaration if it determines that the victim knew he was dying.",
