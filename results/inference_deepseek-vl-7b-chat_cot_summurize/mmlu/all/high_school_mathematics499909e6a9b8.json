            "content": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\nWe are given that the circumference of the circle is $12\\pi$ units, so we can set up the equation $12\\pi = 2\\pi r$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $2\\pi$, we get $6 = r$.\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square.\nSince the radius of the circle is equal to the length of a side of the square, we can set up the equation $s = 6$.\nSubstituting this value into the formula for the area of a square, we get $A = 6^2 = 36$.\nTherefore, the area of the square is $\\boxed{D}$.\nThe answer is: 36",
