This is because the outcome of the litigation is uncertain at the time the fees are paid. If the outcome is successful, the expenses can be deducted from future income, and if the outcome is unsuccessful, the expenses can be deducted from current income.\n\nCapitalizing legal fees would mean treating them as a long-term asset, which is not appropriate in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is \"No Yes,\" indicating that legal fees should not be capitalized.",
