            "content": "Let's denote the initial charge of the capacitor as C. After each second, the capacitor loses half of its charge, so after 5 seconds, it will have lost 5 * (1/2) = 2.5 times its initial charge.\n\nSo, the charge remaining after 5 seconds is C - 2.5C = 0.5C.\n\nGiven that the charge after 5 seconds is q, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.5C = q\n\nNow, we need to find the initial charge C. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5:\n\nC = q / 0.5\n\nSince we are given that the charge after 5 seconds is q, we can substitute q for 0.5C:\n\nC = q / 0.5\n\nNow, we can solve for C:\n\nC = q / 0.5\nC = q / (0.5 * q)\nC = 1 / (0.5)\nC = 2\n\nSo, the initial charge of the capacitor was 2 times its final charge after 5 seconds. Since the final charge is q, the initial charge was 2q.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4q.",
