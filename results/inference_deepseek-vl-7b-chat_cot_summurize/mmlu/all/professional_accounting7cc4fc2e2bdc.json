            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the new value of the inventory turnover (IT) when it is improved to 8 times. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nIT = COGS / Average Inventory\n\nFirst, let's find the average inventory:\n\nAverage Inventory = Total Inventory / IT\n\nWe know that the original IT is 5 times, so the total inventory is:\n\nTotal Inventory = COGS / IT\nTotal Inventory = $800,000 / 5\nTotal Inventory = $160,000\n\nNow, let's find the new IT when it is improved to 8 times:\n\nNew IT = $800,000 / 8\nNew IT = $100,000\n\nNow we can find the new average inventory:\n\nNew Average Inventory = $160,000 / $100,000\nNew Average Inventory = 1.6\n\nNow we can find the new value of the inventory turnover:\n\nNew IT = COGS / New Average Inventory\nNew IT = $800,000 / 1.6\nNew IT = $500,000\n\nNow we can find the difference between the original and new IT:\n\nDifference = New IT - Original IT\nDifference = $500,000 - $800,000\nDifference = -$300,000\n\nSince the difference is negative, it means that the funds are released from the inventory. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $160,000 is released.",
