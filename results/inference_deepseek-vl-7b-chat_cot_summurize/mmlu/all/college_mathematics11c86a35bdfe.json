We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\n(sin x + cos x)^4 = (sin x - cos x)^4\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nsin^4 x + 4sin^3 x cos x + 6sin^2 x cos^2 x + cos^4 x = sin^4 x - 4sin^3 x cos x + 6sin^2 x cos^2 x - cos^4 x\n\nSince the left side is a sum of squares, it must be nonnegative. Therefore, the right side must also be nonnegative. This means that the right side must be equal to 0:\n\n0 = sin^4 x - 4sin^3 x cos x + 6sin^2 x cos^2 x - cos^4 x\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for x:\n\nsin^4 x - 4sin^3 x cos x + 6sin^2 x cos^2 x - cos^4 x = 0\n\nThis is a fourth-degree polynomial equation in sin x. We can use numerical methods to find the roots, but it turns out that there are no real roots for this equation. Therefore, the curves do not intersect at any real value of x.\n\nSince the curves do not intersect, there is no area between them. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNone of the above",
