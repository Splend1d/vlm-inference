Baring one's entire naked body at a nudist beach is generally considered to be a normal and acceptable behavior within the context of that setting.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is considering having their baby's ears fixed to prevent teasing. While some people might argue that this is a form of body modification, it is not necessarily morally wrong. The decision to have a medical procedure like ear pinning is a personal choice and depends on the individual's values and beliefs. It is not inherently wrong to want to protect one's child from potential teasing or bullying.",
