David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring.\n4. They negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus:\n\nConsumer surplus: The difference between what David is willing to pay and what he actually pays. In this case, David is willing to pay $175, but he pays $125. So, the consumer surplus is $175 - $125 = $50.\n\nProducer surplus: The difference between what Elsa values her time at and what she actually earns. In this case, Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, but she earns $125 for two hours of tutoring. So, the producer surplus is $50 * 2 - $125 = $50.\n\nNow, let's compare the consumer and producer surpluses:\n\nConsumer surplus: $50\nProducer surplus: $50\n\nThe difference between consumer and producer surplus is $50 - $50 = $0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.",
