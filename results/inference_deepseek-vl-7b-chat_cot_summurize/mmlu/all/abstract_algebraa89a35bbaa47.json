            "content": "To find the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23 using Fermat's theorem, we first need to find the modular exponentiation of 3^47 with respect to 23.\n\nFermat's theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^(p-1) \u2261 1 (mod p) if a is not divisible by p.\n\nIn our case, p = 23 (a prime number) and a = 3.\n\n3^(23-1) = 3^22 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23. We can do this by repeatedly applying the modular exponentiation formula:\n\n(a^(p-1)) * (a^1) \u2261 a (mod p)\n\n3^22 * 3^1 \u2261 3^23 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23. We can do this by repeatedly applying the modular exponentiation formula:\n\n(3^47) * (3^22) \u2261 3^49 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nSo, the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
