The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n",

The information provided in the passage does not directly mention any of the options given. However, we can infer that option D, \"Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy,\" is the most likely consequence.\n\nThe passage mentions that the Mongol khans' rule led to an important new stage in international contact, with secure trade routes and the transmission of new ideas and inventions. This suggests that the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s likely had a significant impact on the development of Russia's political and administrative systems.\n\nWhile the passage does not explicitly state that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy as a result of the Mongol conquest, it does imply that the Mongol rule had a lasting impact on Russia's development. Therefore, option D is the most reasonable answer based on the information provided.",
