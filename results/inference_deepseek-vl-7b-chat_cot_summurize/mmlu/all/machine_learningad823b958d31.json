The algorithm iteratively updates the parameters of the model to minimize a loss function, which in the case of Gaussian mixture models, is typically the negative log-likelihood of the data.\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nThe time complexity of learning a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier is not linear in the number of records in the dataset. The time complexity of learning a Bayes optimal classifier is generally considered to be O(n^2), where n is the number of records in the dataset. This is because the classifier needs to compute the determinant of the covariance matrix, which has a time complexity of O(n^3). Therefore, the time complexity of learning a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier is not linear in the number of records in the dataset.",
