These are all objects that can be reached from the root set, which is used to identify objects that can be garbage collected.\n\nHowever, dynamically allocated objects on the heap are not part of the root set. These objects are allocated and deallocated dynamically by the program, and their memory is not directly reachable from the root set. Therefore, they are not part of the objects that the garbage collector can reclaim.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Dynamically allocated objects on the heap.",
