Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\". This strengthens the argument for female soldiers to be engaged in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations.\nB. Perpetuation of violence against women in post-conflict society has devalued the claim that violence is more prevalent in militarized societies. Women were as protected by men in pre-war society as they were in post-war society.\nC. Case studies revealed that in certain military families, levels of violence were dependent on the degree of psychological damage inflicted during fighting, however this was variable and dependent on the individual not on gender basis.\nD. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\" which may actually undermine liberal feminists' case of the \"right to fight\".\n",

Engaging female soldiers in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations, could be a practical solution to addressing the protection of women in conflict zones. This would allow for the use of female soldiers' unique skills and experiences to help rebuild and stabilize post-conflict societies.\n\nB. While violence against women in post-conflict society may be devalued in militarized societies, it is important to recognize that violence against women is a global issue that transcends military involvement. Therefore, it is crucial to address the root causes of violence against women and work towards creating a more equitable and just society for all.\n\nC. The variable and individual-dependent nature of violence within military families suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing gender-based violence is not effective. Instead, a more nuanced and individualized approach is needed to effectively address the issue.\n\nD. The ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women highlights the need for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing gender-based violence in post-conflict societies. This approach should involve not only the military, but also civil society organizations, governments, and international organizations working together to create a more equitable and just society for all.",
