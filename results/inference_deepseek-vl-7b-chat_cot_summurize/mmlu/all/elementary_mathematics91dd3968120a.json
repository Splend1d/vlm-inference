This means for every 2 parts of vinegar, we need 5 parts of oil.\n\nWe can set up the proportion as follows:\n\n2 parts vinegar / 5 parts oil = 9 parts vinegar / x parts oil\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross multiply:\n\n2 * x = 5 * 9\n\n2x = 45\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 45 / 2\n\nx = 22.5\n\nSo, 22.5 ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 22.5.",
