Steps 1 and 2 are exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the formation of a solution, the solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute. This process involves the breaking of intermolecular forces, which requires energy. This process is exothermic, meaning that energy is released into the surroundings.\n\nStep 2 involves the solute molecules being separated so they can fit into the spaces in the solvent. This process also requires energy, but since the solute is already in the solution, there is no need to create space for it. Therefore, this process is also exothermic.\n\nStep 3 involves the solute and solvent being brought together, filling in the spaces. This process requires energy because the solute and solvent must overcome the intermolecular forces to come together. This process is endothermic, meaning that energy is taken from the surroundings and used to overcome the intermolecular forces.\n\nTherefore, steps 1 and 2 are exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic.",
