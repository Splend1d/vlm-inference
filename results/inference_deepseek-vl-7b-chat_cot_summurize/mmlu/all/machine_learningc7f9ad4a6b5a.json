            "content": "Statement 1: A neural network's convergence depends on the learning rate.\nThis statement is true. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size of the updates to the model parameters. It plays a crucial role in determining the convergence of the neural network. If the learning rate is too high, the model may overshoot the optimal solution and get stuck in local minima. If the learning rate is too low, the model may take a very long time to converge.\n\nStatement 2: Dropout multiplies randomly chosen activation values by zero.\nThis statement is false. Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time. This means that during training, some neurons are ignored, which helps to improve the generalization of the model. However, the activation values themselves are not multiplied by zero, but rather, the connections between neurons are randomly deactivated.",
