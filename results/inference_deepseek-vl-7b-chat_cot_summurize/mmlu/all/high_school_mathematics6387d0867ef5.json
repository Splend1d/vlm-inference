There are 13 multiples of 13 from $-200$ to $200$, and 5 of them are congruent to 5 modulo 13: $-13, -2, -4, -6, -8$.\n\nNext, we find the number of integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 13 and also congruent to 5 modulo 13. There are 13 multiples of 13 from $-200$ to $200$, and 5 of them are congruent to 5 modulo 13: $-13, -2, -4, -6, -8$.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 13 and also congruent to 5 modulo 13 from the total number of integers from $-200$ to $200$. There are 401 integers in total, and 5 of them are congruent to 5 modulo 13: $-13, -2, -4, -6, -8$.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 13 is $13 \\times 5 - 5 = 60$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
