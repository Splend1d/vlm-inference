It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?\n\nA. It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority.\nB. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\nC.

It did not accept the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority. The text suggests that it is safer to be feared than loved, implying that the ruler should not rely on the loyalty of the people.\n\nB. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology. The text focuses on the practical aspects of ruling, such as the need for caution and the reliance on payments rather than nobility of mind to maintain friendships.\n\nC. It did not stress the importance of looking back to the classical past. While the text mentions the classical past in the context of the comparison between being loved and feared, it does not emphasize the importance of classical ideals in its political philosophy.\n\nD. It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries. The text does not mention or emphasize the importance of equality across class boundaries in its political philosophy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. It did not accept the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority.",
