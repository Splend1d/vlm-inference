This stage typically occurs between the ages of 2 and 7. During this stage, children begin to use symbols and have a more complex thought process, but they still have difficulty understanding the thoughts and perspectives of others. The Sensorimotor stage (ages 0-2), Concrete operational stage (ages 7-11), and Formal operational stage (ages 11 and up) are stages where children develop different cognitive abilities and understanding of others' perspectives.",
