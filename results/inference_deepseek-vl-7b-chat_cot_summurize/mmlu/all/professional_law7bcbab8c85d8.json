They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, \"not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. \"Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in\n\nA. the boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nB. the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.\nD. the co-worker as owner in fee simple.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. the boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nThe reason for this is that the couple were originally joint tenants with right of survivorship when they purchased the property. This means that if one of them dies, their share of the property automatically passes to the surviving partner. The boyfriend's attempt to sell the property to his co-worker without the student's knowledge and forge her signature does not change the nature of their joint tenancy. The fact that the co-worker recorded the deed does not affect the ownership of the property, as the deed was not properly executed and recorded. Therefore, the property still belongs to the boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.",
