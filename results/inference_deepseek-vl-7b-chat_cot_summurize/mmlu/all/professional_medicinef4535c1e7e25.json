Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects?\n\nA. HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations\nB. The study was not blinded\nC. There was a Type II error\nD. Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure\n",
