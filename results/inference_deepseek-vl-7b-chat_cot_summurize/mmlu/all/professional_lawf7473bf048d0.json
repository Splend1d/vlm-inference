            "content": "A homeowner was interested in changing the look of his home. He contacted an architect, who designed plans and specifications for a major \"facelift\" of the homeowner's home. The homeowner was very pleased with the plans and specifications. He showed the plans and specifications to his neighbor, who agreed that the facelift would greatly enhance the value of the homeowner's home. The homeowner contacted a contractor, who was considered to be the best in the area, to rebuild his house according to the plans and specifications. The contractor reviewed the plans and specifications and told the homeowner that he could do all the work called for by the plans and specifications for $100,000. The homeowner replied, \"That's a little more than I can afford. I really can only free up $80,000 for this project. Would you do it for that amount?\" The contractor responded, \"That's awfully low. I'll have to think about it,\" and then left. The next day, the neighbor telephoned the contractor. The neighbor explained to the contractor that he realized the value of his home would be enhanced by the improvement done to the homeowner's property. For that reason, the neighbor told the contractor he would pay him $10,000 if he would accept the homeowner's proposal and do the work called for by the plans and specifications. The contractor agreed. The next day the contractor informed the homeowner that he would accept his $80,000 offer. The contractor did all the work called for by the plans and specifications, and collected the $80,000 due him from the homeowner. However, the neighbor refused to pay the contractor the $10,000. If the contractor brings a breach of contract action against the neighbor, judgment for whom?\n\nA. The contractor, because his signing a contract with the homeowner and completing the work according to the plans and specifications was legally sufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise to pay him the $10,000.\nB. The contractor, provided the neighbor realizes an increase in his property value as a result of the work done by the contractor.\nC. The neighbor, because his promise to the contractor was illusory.\nD. The neighbor, because at the moment the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, he came under a pre-existing obligation, which was insufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise.\n",

This agreement created a legally binding contract between the contractor and the neighbor, which the neighbor breached by not paying the additional $10,000.
