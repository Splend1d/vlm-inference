            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the following equations:\n\n1. The cyclotron frequency (f) is given by:\nf = (eBv) / (2\u03c0m)\n\n2. The cyclotron frequency is given as 1,600 hertz:\nf = 1,600 Hz\n\n3. The magnetic field (B) is given as \u03c0/4 tesla:\nB = \u03c0/4 T\n\n4. The charge (e) of the particle is twice that of an electron, so e = 2e\u2080.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the cyclotron frequency equation and solve for the mass (m):\n\n1,600 = (2e\u2080\u03c0/4)(v) / (2\u03c0m)\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for m:\n\nm = (1,600 * 2\u03c0) / (\u03c0/4 * v)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the magnetic field and the cyclotron frequency:\n\nm = (1,600 * 2\u03c0) / (\u03c0/4 * 1,600)\n\nm = (3,840 * \u03c0) / (1,600)\n\nm = (3,840 * \u03c0) / 1,600\n\nm = 2.354 * 10^-22 kg\n\nSo, the particle's mass is approximately 2.354 * 10^-22 kg, which corresponds to option C.",
