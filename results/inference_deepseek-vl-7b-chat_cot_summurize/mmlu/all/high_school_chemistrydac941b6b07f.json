Since the weak acid is monoprotic, we can assume that it completely dissociates into the conjugate acid and the hydronium ion (H3O+). Therefore, the concentration of the conjugate acid is equal to the concentration of the weak acid:\n\n[A^-] = 0.25 mol / 0.25 L = 1 M\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n4.26 = 8.52 - log(1/0.25)\n\n4.26 = 8.52 - 3.30\n\n4.26 = 5.22\n\nSince the equation does not hold true, the pH value of 4.26 is not consistent with the given values. Therefore, the pKa of the weak acid cannot be determined from the given information.",
