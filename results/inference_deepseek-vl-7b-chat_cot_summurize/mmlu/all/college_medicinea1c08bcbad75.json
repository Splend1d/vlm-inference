At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n",

            "content": "A. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\n\nThis answer is the best explanation for the teacher's observation. The teacher's reward system is a variable ratio schedule, where students receive a reward (a sticker) at the end of each week, regardless of the number of days they showed up on time. This type of schedule creates a strong response and makes the behavior less susceptible to extinction, meaning that the students' behavior (showing up on time) has not changed significantly even though the reward (stickers) has increased.\n\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\n\nThis answer is not the best explanation because it suggests that the students had a stronger intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time. However, the teacher's observation shows that the students' performance on quizzes has increased significantly, but tardiness has only decreased slightly. This indicates that the students' motivation to show up on time is not the main factor affecting their behavior.\n\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\n\nThis answer is not the best explanation because it suggests that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule. However, the teacher's reward system is a variable ratio schedule, not a fixed-ratio or continuous reinforcement schedule.\n\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n\nThis answer is not the best explanation because it suggests that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.
