The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall.

I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand\u2026In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city.

The passage does not directly support any of the given options. However, it does provide some indirect support for option C. The passage mentions that the King of China is a Tartar and one of the descendants of Genghis Khan, which implies that there was some form of contact or interaction between the Chinese and the steppe nomads, which could be seen as a form of trade link. Therefore, the most directly supported conclusion by the passage is option C.",
