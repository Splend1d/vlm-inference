This is morally wrong because lying is dishonest and goes against the principle of being honest.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character does not dispose of their trash properly by leaving a hamburger wrapper in the ocean. This is morally wrong because littering can harm the environment and other living creatures. However, it is not as morally wrong as lying, which is a more serious breach of trust and honesty.",
