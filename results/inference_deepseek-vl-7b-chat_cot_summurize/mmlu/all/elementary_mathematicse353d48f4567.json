We know that 18 stamps cost $8.28, so we can set up the proportion:\n\n18 stamps / $8.28 = 12 stamps / x\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross multiply:\n\n18 * x = 12 * $8.28\n\n18x = $99.36\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 18 to solve for x:\n\nx = $99.36 / 18\n\nx = $5.52\n\nSo, it would cost Sam $5.52 to buy 12 stamps. The correct answer is D. $5.52.",
