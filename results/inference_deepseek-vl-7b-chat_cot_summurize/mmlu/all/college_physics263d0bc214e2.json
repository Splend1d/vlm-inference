            "content": "To find the average total energy of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a temperature reservoir at temperature T, we can use the equipartition theorem. The equipartition theorem states that the average energy of a system of N independent harmonic oscillators is given by:\n\nE = N * kT\n\nIn this case, the oscillator is a single harmonic oscillator, so N = 1. Therefore, the average total energy of the oscillator is:\n\nE = kT\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. kT.",
