            "content": "A. Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA.\n\nThis statement is correct. Exons are noncoding DNA sequences that are transcribed into RNA but not translated into proteins. They are spliced together with introns, which are sequences of DNA that are not translated into proteins.\n\nB. The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The first exon of a protein-coding gene does not always contain the translational start site. The start site is usually located within the first few nucleotides of the first exon, but it can also be located within the first exon or even later in the gene.\n\nC. The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The last exon of a protein-coding gene does not always contain the normal termination codon. The termination codon is usually located within the last exon, but it can also be located within the last exon or later in the gene.\n\nD. A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. A coding exon can be translated in any of the three possible forward reading frames. The reading frame is determined by the direction of the genetic code, which is based on the orientation of the codon. If the codon is read in the correct orientation, it will be translated into the corresponding amino acid. If the codon is read in the wrong orientation, it will be translated into the corresponding amino acid in the opposite reading frame.",
