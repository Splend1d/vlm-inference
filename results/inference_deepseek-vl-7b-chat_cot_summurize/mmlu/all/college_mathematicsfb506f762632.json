This means that f has a local maximum at P.\n\nCase 2: f_x(P) < 0 and f_y(P) < 0\nIn this case, both partial derivatives are negative at point P. This means that f has a local minimum at P.\n\nCase 3: f_x(P) > 0 and f_y(P) < 0\nIn this case, f_x(P) is positive and f_y(P) is negative at point P. This means that f has a saddle point at P.\n\nCase 4: f_x(P) < 0 and f_y(P) > 0\nIn this case, f_x(P) is negative and f_y(P) is positive at point P. This means that f has a saddle point at P.\n\nCase 5: f_x(P) = 0 and f_y(P) = 0\nIn this case, both partial derivatives are zero at point P. This means that f has a critical point at P, which could be a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point depending on the second partial derivatives.\n\nSince we are looking for distinct points P and Q, we can assume that P and Q are not the same point. Therefore, we can analyze the behavior of the partial derivatives at P and Q separately.\n\nIf f has a local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q, then we have Case 3.\n\nIf f has a local minimum at P and a saddle point at Q, then we have Case 4.\n\nIf f has a local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q, then we have Case 5.\n\nIf f has a local minimum at P and a saddle point at Q, then we have Case 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q",
