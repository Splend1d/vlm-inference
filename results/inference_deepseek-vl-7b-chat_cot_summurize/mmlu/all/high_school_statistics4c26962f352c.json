            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of expected value and standard deviation in probability theory.\n\nThe expected value of a random variable W, given the weights of the players, is the sum of the products of each possible weight and its probability. In this case, we are given that the expected value of W is 992 pounds.\n\nThe standard deviation of W is the square root of the variance of W, which is the sum of the squared differences from the mean divided by the number of players. In this case, we are given that the standard deviation of W is approximately 47 pounds.\n\nSince we are selecting four players at random, the number of players is 4. Therefore, the variance of W is 4 times the standard deviation squared, which is 4 * 47^2 = 4 * 22807 = 91228.\n\nNow, we can find the standard deviation of W by taking the square root of the variance:\n\nStandard deviation of W = \u221a91228 \u2248 141 pounds\n\nSo, the standard deviation of W is approximately 141 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 141 pounds.",
