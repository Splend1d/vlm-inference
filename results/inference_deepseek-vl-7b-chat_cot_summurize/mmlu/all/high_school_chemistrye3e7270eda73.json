            "content": "To determine the pH of the solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of a weak acid to the concentration of the acid and its conjugate base.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is given by:\n\npH = pKa + (log([A-]) - log([HA]))/(RT)\n\nwhere:\n- pH is the pH of the solution\n- pKa is the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the weak acid\n- [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base\n- [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid\n- R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- pKa = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 (given)\n- [A-] = 0.0300 mol/50 mL = 0.0006 mol/L (since 0.0300 mol is 0.0006 mol/L)\n- [HA] = 0.0300 mol/50 mL = 0.0006 mol/L (since 0.0300 mol is 0.0006 mol/L)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 + (log([A-]) - log([HA]))/(8.314 J/mol\u00b7K)\n\nSince [A-] and [HA] are equal, we can simplify the equation:\n\npH = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 + (log(0.0006 mol/L) - log(0.0006 mol/L))/(8.314 J/mol\u00b7K)\n\npH = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 + (log(0.0006) - log(0.0006))/(8.314 J/mol\u00b7K)\n\npH = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 + (0 - 0)/8.314 J/mol\u00b7K\n\npH = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5\n\nThe pH of the solution is approximately 4.74.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
