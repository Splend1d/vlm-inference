By the Sylow theorems, if a group has an element of order 15, then it must have a subgroup of order 15. The number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 3 and congruent to 1 mod 5. Therefore, there must be at least 8 of them.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This statement is false. The number of elements of order 15 in a group is not necessarily related to the number of elements of order 15 in a subgroup. For example, consider the cyclic group of order 15. It has only one element of order 15, but it has infinitely many elements of order 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
