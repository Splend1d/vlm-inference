An AR and an MA model: The PACF can be used to distinguish between an AR and an MA model. The PACF of an AR model will be non-zero for all lag values, while the PACF of an MA model will be zero for all lag values except for the first lag.\n\nB. An AR and an ARMA model: The PACF can also be used to distinguish between an AR and an ARMA model. The PACF of an ARMA model will be non-zero for some lag values, while the PACF of an AR model will be non-zero for all lag values.\n\nC. An MA and an ARMA model: The PACF can be used to distinguish between an MA and an ARMA model. The PACF of an MA model will be zero for all lag values except for the first lag, while the PACF of an ARMA model will be non-zero for some lag values.\n\nD. Different models from within the ARMA family: The PACF can also be used to distinguish between different models within the ARMA family. For example, the PACF of an AR(1) model will be non-zero for all lag values, while the PACF of an AR(2) model will be non-zero for some lag values.\n\nIn summary, the PACF can be used to distinguish between different models within the ARMA family, as well as between an AR and an MA model, and between an MA and an ARMA model.",
