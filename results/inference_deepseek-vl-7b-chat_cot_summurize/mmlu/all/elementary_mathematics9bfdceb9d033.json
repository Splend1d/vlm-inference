            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the humpback whales traveled and then calculate the difference in miles traveled between the humpback whales and the gray whales.\n\nFirst, let's find the rate at which the humpback whales traveled. We know that they traveled 2,240 miles in 28 days. To find their rate, we divide the distance by the time:\n\nRate of humpback whales = Distance / Time = 2,240 miles / 28 days = 80 miles per day\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance the humpback whales would have traveled in 32 days if they had traveled at the same rate:\n\nDistance traveled by humpback whales = Rate * Time = 80 miles per day * 32 days = 2,560 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in miles traveled between the humpback whales and the gray whales:\n\nDifference = Distance traveled by humpback whales - Distance traveled by gray whales = 2,560 miles - 2,368 miles = 192 miles\n\nSo, the humpback whales would have traveled 192 miles more than the gray whales if they had traveled at the same rate for 32 days.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 192.",
