The ReLU function, $f(x) = max(0, x)$, has a gradient of zero for $x<0$. The sigmoid function, $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$, has a gradient of $\\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))$, which is less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$ for all $x$.\n\nStatement 2: The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.\n\nThis statement is true. The sigmoid function has a continuous gradient because it is a smooth function. The ReLU function has a discontinuous gradient because it is a piecewise function with a jump discontinuity at $x=0$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
