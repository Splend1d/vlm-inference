            "content": "On Thursday, March 7, an owner's home was destroyed by fire. The owner's house was insured against such fire loss by an insurance company. According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.\nB. admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.\nC. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.\n",

            "content": "The bookkeeper's proposed testimony is a statement made by the owner to the bookkeeper, which is hearsay. Hearsay is a statement that is offered as evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not admissible as the best evidence, which means it is not admissible as the most reliable evidence of the contents of the envelope.\n\nHowever, there is an exception to the hearsay rule in some jurisdictions, which allows a statement made by a party to a lawsuit to be admissible if it is a statement made in the course of the regular business of the party's trade or profession. In this case, the bookkeeper's testimony would likely be admissible under this exception, as the bookkeeper's role is to handle the owner's mail and would be expected to know if the owner handed her an envelope containing a notice form for the insurance company.\n\nTherefore, the bookkeeper's proposed testimony is admissible because the owner's statement to her is admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.",
