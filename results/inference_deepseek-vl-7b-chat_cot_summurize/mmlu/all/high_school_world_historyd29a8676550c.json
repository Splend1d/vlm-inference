The rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith\nB. The arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders\nC. The eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force\nD. The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts\n\nThe correct answer is D. The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts.\n\nUnder Ashoka, the Mauryan emperor, there was a significant change in the religious landscape of India. Ashoka was a devout Buddhist, and he actively promoted Buddhism throughout his empire. He built Buddhist stupas, supported the translation of Buddhist texts into Prakrit, and sent Buddhist missionaries to neighboring countries. He also issued the famous Edicts of Ashoka, which included the \"Dhamma Edicts,\" which promoted the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith: Sikhism did not rise until much later, in the 16th century, and it was not a syncretic faith.\n\nB. The arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders: Islam did not arrive in India until much later, in the 7th century, and it was not borne by external invaders.\n\nC. The eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force: Ashoka was a devout Buddhist, but he did not eradicate traditional Hinduism. In fact, he allowed people to continue practicing their own religions as long as they did not harm others.",
