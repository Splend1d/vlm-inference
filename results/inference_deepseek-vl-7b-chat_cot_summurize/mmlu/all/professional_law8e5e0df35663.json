            "content": "An owner of an apartment building in a rundown section of town knew that one of his tenants was dealing drugs from his apartment. He also knew that the tenant's actions had led to some violent confrontations in the past, including one where a gun was discharged in the hallway outside the tenant's apartment. Because the tenant regularly paid his rent on time, the owner didn't take any action to try to evict the tenant. One day, a rival drug dealer drove by the tenant's apartment and fired his gun at the tenant's front window. One of the bullets passed through the tenant's living room and went through the wall into the apartment next door. The bullet struck and injured a neighbor who occupied the adjoining apartment. If the neighbor asserts a claim against the owner to recover damages for his injury, he should\n\nA. recover, because the owner knew that the tenant was dealing drugs from his apartment.\nB. recover, because the owner was aware that such danger existed because of the tenant's drug-dealing activities.\nC. not recover, because the owner is not liable for the criminal acts of third persons.\nD. not recover, because the neighbor is outside the zone of foreseeable danger.\n",

Therefore, the owner should have foreseen the possibility of a rival drug dealer shooting at the tenant's apartment. The owner's inaction to evict the tenant despite knowing about the drug dealing and the resulting violence indicates that he should have taken steps to mitigate the risk to the neighbors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the owner's knowledge of the tenant's drug dealing does not necessarily mean he should be held liable for the injuries caused by the rival drug dealer's actions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the owner's knowledge of the danger does not absolve him of liability. The owner should have taken steps to prevent the injury, such as evicting the tenant or taking other measures to protect the neighbors.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the neighbor is within the zone of foreseeable danger. The owner's inaction to evict the tenant and his knowledge of the drug dealing and resulting violence should have made it foreseeable that a rival drug dealer would shoot at the tenant's apartment and injure a neighbor.",
