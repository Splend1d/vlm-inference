            "content": "The current ratio and quick ratio are used to assess a company's liquidity, which is the ability to meet its short-term financial obligations. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities, while the quick ratio is calculated by dividing liquid assets (cash and marketable securities) by current liabilities.\n\nIn this case, the current ratio is 3-to-1, which means that for every $3 of current assets, there is $1 of current liabilities. The quick ratio is 1-to-1, which means that for every $1 of liquid assets, there is $1 of current liabilities.\n\nGiven that the current liabilities were $322,000, we can calculate the current assets as follows:\n\nCurrent assets = Current liabilities / Current ratio\nCurrent assets = $322,000 / 3\nCurrent assets = $107,333.33\n\nSince the current ratio is 3-to-1, we can also calculate the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses as follows:\n\nTotal amount for inventory and prepaid expenses = Current assets - Current liabilities\nTotal amount for inventory and prepaid expenses = $107,333.33 - $322,000\nTotal amount for inventory and prepaid expenses = -$214,666.67\n\nSince the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is negative, it means that the company has more current assets than current liabilities. This is not possible in a real-world scenario, so there must be an error in the calculations. Please double-check the calculations and provide the correct information.\n\nIf the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is indeed negative, it would mean that the company has more inventory and prepaid expenses than current liabilities, which is not possible. This would indicate a mistake in the calculations or the information provided.",
