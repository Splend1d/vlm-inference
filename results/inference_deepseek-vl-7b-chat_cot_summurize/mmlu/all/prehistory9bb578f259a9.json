It is supported by recent research that has shown a correlation between the areas of the brain responsible for tool making and language production and comprehension. For example, studies have found that the Broca's area, which is involved in language production, is also involved in fine motor control, which is necessary for tool making. This suggests that the skills used in tool making may have indirectly contributed to the development of language.",
