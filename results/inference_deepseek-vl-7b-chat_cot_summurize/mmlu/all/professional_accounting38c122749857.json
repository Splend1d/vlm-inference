Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $60,000.\n\nThe company paid $90,000 for services that will be performed over a six-month period. Since the payment was made in October, year 1, the company should record an adjusting journal entry to reflect this prepayment in its year 1 financial statements.\n\nThe adjusting journal entry would be:\n\nD. Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $60,000.\n\nThis entry records the prepayment of $90,000 for services that will be performed in year 2. The debit side of the entry represents the expense of the prepayment, while the credit side represents the increase in the prepaid services account. The $60,000 is the correct amount to debit the services expense account, as it represents half of the total payment made in October, year 1. The remaining $30,000 would be recorded in the year 2 financial statements.",
