            "content": "The reserve ratio is the proportion of money that a bank holds in reserve, as a percentage of the total amount of money it has issued in deposits. In this case, the reserve ratio is 10%.\n\nWhen a new customer deposits $500, the bank creates a deposit of $500. However, the bank must also hold a reserve of 10% of this deposit, which is 10% of $500. To calculate this, we multiply $500 by 10%:\n\n$500 * 10% = $50\n\nSo, the bank must hold $50 in reserve. The remaining amount of money created is the total deposit minus the reserve:\n\n$500 (total deposit) - $50 (reserve) = $450\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount of money created is $450. The correct answer is B.",
