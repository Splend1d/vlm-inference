            "content": "An avowed member of an antigovernment organization was elected president of a union. A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?\n\nA. Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\nC. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking about the applicable rule of law in a situation where a senator makes derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization during a legislative hearing, and the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. The president wants to sue the senator for defamation.\n\nOption A is not relevant to the situation because it talks about the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which is not mentioned in the question.\n\nOption B is also not relevant because it talks about a congressman, not a senator, and it does not mention defamation or the president's dismissal from his position.\n\nOption C is not relevant because it talks about the constitutional requirement for actual malice, which is not mentioned in the question.\n\nOption D is the most relevant to the situation. It states that it is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances. This means that the senator's derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization during a legislative hearing are not a violation of the president's rights, and the president cannot sue the senator for defamation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
