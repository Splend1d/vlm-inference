Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n",

The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\n\nThe Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) does release some energy in the form of ATP, but it is not the most energy-rich process. The Krebs cycle mainly breaks down pyruvate into CO2 and other compounds, but it does not directly produce ATP.\n\nThe oxidative phosphorylation stage of cellular respiration, which includes the electron transport chain and the final stages of the citric acid cycle, is where the most energy is released. In this stage, NADH and FADH2 molecules donate electrons to the electron transport chain, which leads to the production of ATP. Each NADH molecule can produce 2 ATPs, and each FADH2 molecule can produce 3 ATPs. This process is more energy-rich than the Krebs cycle, making it the stage where the most energy is harvested.",
