            "content": "To find the vapor pressure of the mixture, we can use the Raoult's law, which states that the vapor pressure of a solution is the sum of the partial vapor pressures of the individual components.\n\nLet V_A and V_B be the molar volumes of solvent A and B, respectively. The mole fraction of A in the mixture is given as 0.285.\n\nThe vapor pressure of the mixture can be calculated as:\n\nP_mix = P_A * (1 - x_A) + P_B * x_A\n\nwhere P_A and P_B are the vapor pressures of solvent A and B, respectively, and x_A is the mole fraction of A in the mixture.\n\nGiven that the mole fraction of A is 0.285, we can write:\n\nx_A = 0.285\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nP_A = 345 torr\nP_B = 213 torr\n\nP_mix = 345 * (1 - 0.285) + 213 * 0.285\nP_mix = 345 * 0.715 + 213 * 0.285\nP_mix = 241.325 + 61.47\nP_mix = 302.795 torr\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of the mixture is approximately 302.795 torr.\n\nComparing this value with the given options, the closest answer is:\n\nD. 251 torr",
