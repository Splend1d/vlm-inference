We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nPolitical discord during the Vietnam War most closely resembled the political dissensions during which of the following?\n\nA. The Spanish-American War\nB. The Mexican War\nC. World War I\nD. World War II\n",

This is because both periods saw significant internal divisions within countries, with different groups having differing opinions on the war and its goals. In the case of the Vietnam War, there were debates over the use of force and the extent of U.S. involvement. In World War I, there were debates over the war's goals and the effectiveness of the Allied and Central Powers' strategies. While the Spanish-American War, the Mexican War, and World War II also had their share of political discord, the comparison to World War I is the most accurate in terms of the scope and nature of the disagreements.",
