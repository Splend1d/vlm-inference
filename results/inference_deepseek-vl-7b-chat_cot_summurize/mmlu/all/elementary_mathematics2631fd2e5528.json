We can write this as $N = 186,425$.\n\nWe want to find a number $M$ such that the value of the digit 6 in $M$ is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in $N$. This can be written as $M = 10 \\times N$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $N$ into the equation, we get $M = 10 \\times 186,425$.\n\nCalculating the value of $M$, we get $M = 1864,250$.\n\nComparing this value with the given options, we find that the number $M = 1864,250$ is not among the options.\n\nTherefore, there is no number in the given options where the value of the digit 6 is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{None of the above}}$.",
