According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic injuries were responsible for an estimated 1.35 million deaths in 2015. This makes them the leading cause of death among 15- to 44-year-olds.\n\nDiarrheal diseases, such as cholera and dysentery, are also a significant cause of death, particularly in low-income countries. In 2015, diarrheal diseases were responsible for an estimated 210,000 deaths, primarily among children under the age of five.\n\nDiabetes, on the other hand, is a chronic condition that affects blood sugar levels. While it does not directly cause death, complications from diabetes can lead to serious health issues and even death. In 2015, diabetes was responsible for an estimated 4.6 million deaths, making it the seventh leading cause of death globally.\n\nDementia is a progressive neurological disorder that affects cognitive function, memory, and behavior. It is not a direct cause of death, but it can lead to complications such as falls, infections, and malnutrition, which can be fatal. In 2015, dementia was responsible for an estimated 5.8 million deaths, making it the sixth leading cause of death globally.\n\nIt's important to note that these statistics are based on data from 2015, and the causes of death can change over time due to various factors such as improvements in healthcare, changes in lifestyle, and advancements in medical research.",
