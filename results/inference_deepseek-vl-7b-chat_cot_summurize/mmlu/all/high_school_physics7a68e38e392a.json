            "content": "The correct answer is A. v0^2/(2\u03bcg).\n\nThe box slides on the surface without any external forces acting on it, so its speed will be reduced by the frictional force acting between the box and the surface. The frictional force is given by the formula F = \u03bcmg, where \u03bc is the coefficient of kinetic friction, m is the mass of the box, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWhen the box comes to rest, its speed will be reduced to zero. The distance it slides before coming to rest can be calculated using the formula s = ut + 1/2at^2, where s is the distance, u is the initial speed, a is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2 in this case), and t is the time it takes for the box to come to rest.\n\nThe time it takes for the box to come to rest can be calculated using the formula t = v0/a.\n\nSubstituting the values into the distance formula, we get s = (v0^2)/(2\u03bcg).\n\nTherefore, the box slides a distance of v0^2/(2\u03bcg) before coming to rest.",
