            "content": "To determine which of the given options must be divisible by 11, we need to consider the factors of 11. The factors of 11 are 1 and 11.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of its digits and the product of its digits must be divisible by 11. Let's check each option:\n\nA. 4x + 6y\nThe sum of the digits is 4 + 6 = 10, and the product of the digits is 4 * 6 = 24. The difference is 10 - 24 = -14, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nB. x + y + 5\nThe sum of the digits is x + y + 5, and the product of the digits is x * y * 5. The difference is (x + y + 5) - (xy + 5y) = x - y - 5. Since x and y are positive integers, x - y will always be positive. Therefore, x - y - 5 is not divisible by 11.\n\nC. 9x + 4y\nThe sum of the digits is 9x + 4y, and the product of the digits is 9x * 4y. The difference is (9x + 4y) - (36xy) = 9x - 36y - 5y = 9x - 41y. Since x and y are positive integers, 9x - 41y will always be positive. Therefore, 9x - 41y is not divisible by 11.\n\nD. 4x - 9y\nThe sum of the digits is 4x - 9y, and the product of the digits is 4x * 9y. The difference is (4x - 9y) - (36xy) = 4x - 9y - 36y = 4x - 45y. Since x and y are positive integers, 4x - 45y will always be positive. Therefore, 4x - 45y is not divisible by 11.\n\nNone of the given options are divisible by 11.",
