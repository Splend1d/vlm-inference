The probability distribution function p(x) of a continuous random variable x is defined such that 0 \u2264 p(x) \u2264 1 for all x. This is because the probability of any event occurring is always a number between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).\n\nStatement 2: Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain.\n\nThis statement is also true. In decision tree learning, the goal is to create a model that can make accurate predictions by splitting the data into subsets based on the features that provide the most information gain. Information gain is a measure of the reduction in uncertainty or the increase in knowledge that results from making a split on a particular feature. The process of decision tree learning involves making a series of splits that minimize the information gain, leading to a tree that can make accurate predictions.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.
