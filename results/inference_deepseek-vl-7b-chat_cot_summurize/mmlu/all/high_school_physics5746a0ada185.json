            "content": "To find the acceleration due to Earth's gravity, we can use the formula:\n\nAcceleration (a) = Force (F) / Mass (m)\n\nFirst, we need to find the force of Earth's gravity acting on the Space Shuttle. The force of gravity between two objects is given by the formula:\n\nForce (F) = G * (Mass of Earth (M_E) + Mass of Shuttle (M_S)) / R^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 \u00d7 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), M_E is the mass of Earth (approximately 5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg), M_S is the mass of the Space Shuttle, and R is the radius of the orbit (300 km).\n\nHowever, we don't have the mass of the Space Shuttle. Instead, we can use the fact that the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface (g) is approximately 9.8 m/s^2. This acceleration is due to the combined effect of Earth's mass and the Space Shuttle's mass. Therefore, we can write:\n\n9.8 m/s^2 = G * (5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg + M_S) / (6400 km)^2\n\nNow, we can solve for M_S:\n\nM_S = 9.8 m/s^2 * (5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg / 6.674 \u00d7 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (6400 km)^2 / 9.8 m/s^2\n\nM_S \u2248 1.07 \u00d7 10^23 kg\n\nNow that we have the mass of the Space Shuttle, we can find the acceleration due to Earth's gravity:\n\na = F / M_S\na = G * (5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg + 1.07 \u00d7 10^23 kg) / (6400 km)^2\na \u2248 9.8 m/s^2\n\nSo, the acceleration due to Earth's gravity experienced by the Space Shuttle is approximately 9.8 m/s^2, which corresponds to option C.",
