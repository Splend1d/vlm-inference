The applicable state statute limits eligibility to citizens of the United States and aliens seeking U. S. citizenship. A candidate for a J. D. degree at the state law school applied for one of the non-interest-bearing loans. Since he did not intend to seek U. S. citizenship, he was refused the loan for ineligibility under the state statute. In a suit by the candidate challenging the constitutionality of the state statute, he will\n\nA. win, because the statute is violative of the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. win, because classifications by a state that are based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.\nC. lose, because the statute promotes a compelling state interest.\nD. lose, because alienage classifications are not, per Se, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.\n",

The state statute limits eligibility for these loans to citizens of the United States and aliens seeking U.S. citizenship. Since the candidate does not intend to seek U.S. citizenship, he is ineligible for the loan under the state statute.\n\nThe candidate's challenge to the constitutionality of the state statute would be based on the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This clause prohibits states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, and from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nIn this case, the candidate is arguing that the state statute is depriving him of a benefit (the loan) without due process of law, as he was not given an opportunity to challenge his ineligibility under the statute. Additionally, the candidate is arguing that the statute denies him equal protection under the laws, as it discriminates against him based on his alienage, which is not a legitimate state interest.\n\nTherefore, the candidate would likely win the suit, as the state statute is violative of the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",
