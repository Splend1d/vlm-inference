So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 49:\n\n4/7 = 4 * 6/49 = 24/49\n2/7 = 2 * 9/49 = 18/49\n\nNow, we add the fractions:\n\n24/49 + 18/49 = 42/49\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n42/49 \ufffd 2/2 = 21/24.5\n\nSo, the sum of 4/7 and 2/7 is 21/24.5.
