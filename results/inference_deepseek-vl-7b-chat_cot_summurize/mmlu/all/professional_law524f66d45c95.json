Just ahead, the pedestrian noticed a private dinner club. As the pedestrian approached the club, he noticed a sign over the front door that read: \"ADMITTANCE TO MEMBERS ONLY. \" Although the pedestrian was not a member of the exclusive club, he entered the dimly lit club, found a door marked \"Gentlemen,\" and entered the restroom. Which of the following would best describe the pedestrian's legal status when he was in the restroom?\n\nA. Trespasser.\nB. Guest.\nC. Licensee.\nD. Invitee.\n",

In this case, the pedestrian entered the private club for the purpose of using the restroom, even though he was not a member. Therefore, he was a Licensee.\n\nA Trespasser is someone who enters a property without permission, and is not there for a specific purpose. A Guest is someone who is invited to enter a property, and is there for a specific purpose. An Invitee is someone who is invited to enter a property for a specific purpose, and is there for that purpose.\n\nTherefore, the pedestrian's legal status when he was in the restroom would best be described as a Licensee.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
