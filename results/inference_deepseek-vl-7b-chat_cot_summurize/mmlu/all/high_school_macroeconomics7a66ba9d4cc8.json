In fractional reserve banking, banks create money by lending out more than they hold in reserve. If banks hold excess reserves, they have more money in reserve than they need to meet withdrawal demands, which limits their ability to create new money through lending.\n\nA. households that borrow redeposit the entire loan amounts back into the banks. This actually increases the ability of banks to create money, not limit it.\nC. banks lend all excess reserves to borrowing customers.
