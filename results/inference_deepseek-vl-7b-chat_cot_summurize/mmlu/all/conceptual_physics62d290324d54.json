The frequency of the standing wave pattern is determined by the length of the tube.\n\nAt a frequency of 256 Hz, the wavelength of the standing wave pattern is 256 / (2 * pi * 1000) = 1 / 1000 meters. The wavelength of the standing wave pattern is equal to the length of the tube divided by the frequency.\n\nSo, the length of the tube at a frequency of 256 Hz will be one-quarter the value for a tube open at both ends.",
