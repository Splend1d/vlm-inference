Therefore, these costs should be capitalized as software cost.\n\nThe costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility ($15,000) are not directly related to the development of the software. These costs are related to the technological feasibility of the software, which is a separate aspect of the project. Therefore, these costs should not be capitalized as software cost.\n\nSo, the amount to capitalize as software cost is:\n\n$10,000 (detailed program design) + $44,000 (other coding and testing costs) = $54,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $44,000.",
