The given data set is already in ascending order:\n\n$79.88, $17.88, $19.88, $21.88, $29.88\n\nSince there are 5 numbers in the set (an odd number), the median will be the middle number. In this case, the median is the third number:\n\n$17.88, $19.88, $21.88, $29.88\n\nThe median is $19.88. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $19.88",
