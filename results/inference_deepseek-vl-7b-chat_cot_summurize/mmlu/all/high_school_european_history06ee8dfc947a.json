            "content": "The passage describes a situation where a passerby shouts an announcement about the start of war to the narrator. The narrator then goes to his newspaper's office and bursts into the office of Georges Clemenceau, their chief. Clemenceau asks what Paris is saying, and the narrator replies that Paris is singing. Clemenceau then responds with \"It will be all right then.\"\n\nFrom this exchange, we can infer that Clemenceau was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war. He did not show any disgust or doubts about France's ability to win the war, nor did he predict that he would one day serve as prime minister of France. Therefore, the correct answer is D. He was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
