The truth table will have 2^3 = 8 rows, where each row represents a combination of truth values for J, K, and L.\n\nHere is the truth table:\n\n| J | K | L | J \u2261 ~K | J \u2228 L | ~K / L |\n|---|---|---|--------|--------|---------|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |      1 |      1 |       1 |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |      0 |      1 |       0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |      0 |      1 |       0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 |      1 |      0 |       0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |      1 |      1 |       1 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |      0 |      1 |       0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |      0 |      1 |       0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |      1 |      0 |       0 |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table to determine the validity of the argument:\n\n1. J \u2261 ~K:\n   - When J is true, ~K is false.\n   - When J is false, ~K is true.\n   So, J \u2261 ~K is true when J is false and false.\n\n2. J \u2228 L:\n   - When J is true, J \u2228 L is true.\n   - When J is false, J \u2228 L is true.\n   So, J \u2228 L is true when J is true or false.\n\n3. ~K / L:\n   - When K is true and L is true, ~K / L is false.\n   - When K is true and L is false, ~K / L is true.\n   - When K is false and L is true, ~K / L is true.\n   - When K is false and L is false, ~K / L is false.\n   So, ~K / L is true when K is false and L is true or false.\n\nThe argument J \u2261 ~K is true when J is false and false, and J \u2228 L is true when J is true or false. The argument ~K / L is true when K is false and L is true or false. Since all three conditions are true, the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A. Valid.",
