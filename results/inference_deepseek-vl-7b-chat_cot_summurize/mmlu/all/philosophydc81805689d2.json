            "content": "Mill's argument in On Liberty and Other Essays is that individuals should be free to act according to their own judgment, as long as their actions do not harm others. This means that individuals should be free to make decisions based on their own values, beliefs, and understanding of the world, rather than being constrained by external rules or authorities.\n\nIn this context, Mill's claim that we should always calculate the expected consequences of our action (A) is not necessarily the most important aspect of his argument. While it is true that we should consider the potential consequences of our actions, Mill's main point is that individuals should be free to make their own decisions, as long as they do not harm others.\n\nOn the other hand, Mill's claim that we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility (B) is a key aspect of his argument. Mill believed that individuals should make decisions based on the principle of utility, which means that they should consider the consequences of their actions for themselves and others. This principle is closely related to the idea of utilitarianism, which is a moral theory that holds that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being.\n\nMill's claim that we should consult tradition (C) is also an important aspect of his argument. Mill believed that individuals should be free to make their own decisions, but they should also be aware of the values and beliefs that have been passed down through generations. This means that individuals should consider the customs and traditions of their society when making decisions, but they should also be free to challenge and change these traditions if they believe that they are not in the best interests of society.\n\nFinally, Mill's claim that we should consult scripture (D) is not a central aspect of his argument. While Mill was a religious thinker, he did not believe that individuals should make decisions based on religious texts alone. Instead, he believed that individuals should consider the values and beliefs of their society, as well as their own personal values and beliefs, when making decisions.\n\nIn summary, Mill's argument in On Liberty and Other Essays is that individuals should be free to make their own decisions, as long as they do not harm others. This means that individuals should consider the consequences of their actions, but they should also be free to challenge and change traditional values and beliefs if they believe that they are not in the best interests of society.",
