            "content": "To find the coefficient of the (x - 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial for y = x2/3 around x = 8, we can use the formula for the Taylor polynomial of a function of the form f(x) = g(x - h(x)), where h(x) = x - x0 and g(x) is a polynomial of degree n.\n\nThe Taylor polynomial for y = x2/3 around x = 8 is given by:\n\nP(x) = y(x0) + h'(x0)(x - x0) + ... + (h(x0))^n * g(x - x0)^n\n\nIn this case, x0 = 8, h(x) = x - 8, and g(x) = x2. So, we have:\n\nP(x) = (8)(x - 8) + (x - 8)^2/2\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of the (x - 8)2 term, which is the coefficient of the (x - 8) term squared. This term is (x - 8)^2, so we need to find the coefficient of this term in the expansion of (x - 8)^2.\n\nThe coefficient of the (x - 8) term in the expansion of (x - 8)^2 is 1, since (x - 8) is the first term in the expansion.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of the (x - 8) term squared, which is (x - 8)^2. The coefficient of the (x - 8) term squared is 1, since (x - 8) is the first term in the expansion of (x - 8)^2.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the (x - 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial for y = x2/3 around x = 8 is 1/144.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nC. 1/144",
