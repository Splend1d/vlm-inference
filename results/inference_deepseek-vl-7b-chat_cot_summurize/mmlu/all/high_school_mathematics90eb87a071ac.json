In other words, we need to solve the equation $8^x = 2$.\n\nWe can rewrite 8 as $2^3$, so the equation becomes $(2^3)^x = 2$. Using the property of exponents, we can simplify this to $2^{3x} = 2$.\n\nNow, we can equate the exponents and solve for $x$: $3x = 1$. Dividing both sides by 3, we get $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\log_8 2 = \\boxed{\\text{D}}$.",
