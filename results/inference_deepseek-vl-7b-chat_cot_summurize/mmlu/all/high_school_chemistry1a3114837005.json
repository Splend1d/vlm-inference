Solubility of ionic compounds increases with the size of the cations and anions.\n2. Solubility of covalent compounds increases with the size of the molecules.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\nA. NaBr (sodium bromide) - Na is a small cation, and Br is a small anion. The solubility of ionic compounds increases with the size of the cations and anions.\n\nB. NiSO3 (manganese(II) sulfate) - Ni is a medium-sized cation, and SO3 is a small anion. The solubility of ionic compounds increases with the size of the cations and anions.\n\nC. CrCl3 (chromium(III) chloride) - Cr is a medium-sized cation, and Cl is a small anion. The solubility of ionic compounds increases with the size of the cations and anions.\n\nD. Mn(NO3)2 (manganese(II) nitrate) - Mn is a medium-sized cation, and NO3 is a small anion. The solubility of ionic compounds increases with the size of the cations and anions.\n\nBased on the solubility rules, none of the compounds should be expected to be the least soluble in water. However, if we consider the size of the cations and anions, we can make an educated guess:\n\n- Na (cations) is smaller than Ni, Cr, and Mn.\n- Br (anions) is smaller than SO3, NO3.\n\nTherefore, NaBr is expected to be the least soluble in water among the given options.",
