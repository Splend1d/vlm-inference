The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes. A state agency determines the eligibility of applicant institutions. Eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the payments of subsidies under the statute to all church-affiliated institutions in the state. The federal district court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action for lack of standing.\nB. uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause.\nC. invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause.\nD. uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education.\n",

            "content": "The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from favoring or establishing a particular religion. The state statute in question authorizes the payment of state funds to private institutions of higher learning that meet certain criteria and do not award only seminarian or theological degrees. The grants are non-categorical but may not be used for sectarian purposes.\n\nThe federal district court will most likely uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause. This is because the statute does not favor or establish a particular religion, but rather provides a neutral benefit to all private institutions of higher learning that meet the specified criteria. The added provision prohibiting the use of the grants for sectarian purposes further ensures that the statute does not favor or establish a particular religion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause.",
