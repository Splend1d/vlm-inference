            "content": "To break even, the company needs to earn enough revenue to cover its fixed costs. Let's calculate the revenue from selling DVD players and home entertainment systems separately.\n\nRevenue from DVD players:\nEach DVD player sells for $200, and the unit variable cost is $160. So, the profit per DVD player is $200 - $160 = $40.\n\nRevenue from home entertainment systems:\nEach home entertainment system sells for $600, and the unit variable cost is $460. So, the profit per home entertainment system is $600 - $460 = $140.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from selling DVD players and home entertainment systems.\n\nTotal revenue from DVD players:\nThe company sells one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold. So, for every four DVD players sold, they earn one home entertainment system's profit.\n\nTotal revenue from home entertainment systems:\nThe company sells one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold. So, for every four DVD players sold, they earn one home entertainment system's profit.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from selling DVD players and home entertainment systems.\n\nTotal revenue = Total revenue from DVD players + Total revenue from home entertainment systems\nTotal revenue = 4 * $40 + 1 * $140\nTotal revenue = $160 + $140\nTotal revenue = $300\n\nSince the company's fixed costs are $90,000, the company needs to earn at least $90,000 in revenue to break even.\n\nTherefore, the company needs to sell at least $300 in revenue to cover its fixed costs.\n\nThe answer is A. 300.",
