            "content": "To calculate the pH of the resulting mixture, we need to determine the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. We can do this by using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + (log([H+][B-]) / log([B+][B-]))\n\nwhere pKa is the pKa value of the conjugate acid-base pair, [H+] is the concentration of H+ ions, and [B-] is the concentration of the conjugate base.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentration of H+ ions in the HBr solution:\n\n[H+] = [HBr] * (1 - [OH^-]/[HBr])\n\nSince the HBr solution is 0.0025 M, the concentration of OH^- ions is equal to the concentration of KOH, which is 0.0023 M. Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the HBr solution is:\n\n[H+] = 0.0025 M * (1 - 0.0023 M/0.0025 M) = 0.0025 M\n\nNow, let's find the concentration of H+ ions in the KOH solution:\n\n[H+] = [HBr] * (1 - [OH^-]/[HBr])\n[H+] = 0.0023 M * (1 - 0.0025 M/0.0023 M) = 0.0023 M\n\nSince the H+ ions are the same in both solutions, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the resulting mixture:\n\npH = pKa + (log([H+][B-]) / log([B+][B-]))\npH = 4.0 (pKa for HBr) + (log(0.0023 M) / log(0.0025 M))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\npH \u2248 4.0 + (log(0.0023) / log(0.0025)) \u2248 4.0 + 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
