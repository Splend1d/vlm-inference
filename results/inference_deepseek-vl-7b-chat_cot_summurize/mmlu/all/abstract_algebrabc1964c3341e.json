A factor group is a quotient group, and quotient groups can be non-Abelian even if the original group was Abelian. For example, consider the group of integers under addition, which is Abelian. The factor group of integers modulo 2 is not Abelian, as addition modulo 2 is not commutative.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nThis statement is also true. If H is a normal subgroup of G, then the factor group G/H is a group, and K is a normal subgroup of G/H. Since G/H is a group, K is a normal subgroup of G/H. By the Correspondence Theorem, K is a normal subgroup of G.",
