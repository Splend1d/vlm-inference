However, we can estimate the number of data points by finding the number of salaries in the first quartile.\n\nSince the first quartile is $48,815, we can estimate that there are approximately 25% of the total number of salaries in the first quartile. So, we can estimate that there are approximately 25% of the total number of salaries in the first quartile.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nStandard Deviation (SD) = $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.25} \\sum_{i=1}^{0.25} (x_i - 55800)^2}$\n\nStandard Deviation (SD) = $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.25} \\sum_{i=1}^{0.25} (48815 - 55800)^2}$\n\nStandard Deviation (SD) = $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.25} \\sum_{i=1}^{0.25} (-6985)^2}$\n\nStandard Deviation (SD) = $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.25} \\sum_{i=1}^{0.25} 411625}$\n\nStandard Deviation (SD) = $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.25} 1646100}$\n\nStandard Deviation (SD) = $\\sqrt{65844}$\n\nStandard Deviation (SD) = $844.4$\n\nSo, the standard deviation is approximately $844.4$. However, since the options are not in the form of a decimal, we can round it to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the standard deviation is approximately $844$.\n\nThe correct answer is B. $10,356$.",
