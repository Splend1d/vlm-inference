He argues that justice is simply the advantage of the stronger, meaning that those who are stronger and more powerful get to define what is just and unjust. This view is in direct opposition to the traditional Greek belief that justice is a virtue of the soul, and it sets the stage for the philosophical debate between Thrasymachus and Socrates.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the advantage of the stronger.",
