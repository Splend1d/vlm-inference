After several sessions with the boy and his family, you receive a letter from the school principal requesting information about the boy's condition, and a signed release from the boy's parents is included with the letter. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. refuse to release the records to anyone but a licensed psychologist.\nB. refuse to release the records to anyone but the boy's parents.\nC. release only that information you believe to be relevant to the school's concerns.\nD. release photocopies of your complete file on the boy and his family.\n",

In this case, the boy's parents have given you a signed release, which means they have given their consent for you to share information about their son's therapy with the school. Therefore, you should release the records to the school principal, as long as the information shared is relevant to the school's concerns and does not violate the boy's privacy.\n\nIt is important to note that you should not release photocopies of your complete file on the boy and his family, as this could potentially violate the boy's privacy and confidentiality. Instead, you should only share the information that is relevant to the school's concerns and that has been given consent by the boy's parents.\n\nIn conclusion, the best answer is C. release only that information you believe to be relevant to the school's concerns.",
