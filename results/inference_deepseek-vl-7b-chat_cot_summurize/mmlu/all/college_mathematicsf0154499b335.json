            "content": "Statement 1: If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected.\nThis statement is true. The closure of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A. If A is connected, it means that it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. The closure of A is also a connected set, as it contains all the points in A and all the points that are limit points of A.\n\nStatement 2: Every continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) has a fixed point.\nThis statement is also true. A fixed point of a function is a point such that the function maps it back to itself. For a continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1), there exists a point c in the domain such that f(c) = c. This is because continuous functions preserve the topology of the domain, and the only points in the domain that are mapped to themselves under a continuous function are the boundary points of the domain.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A.",
