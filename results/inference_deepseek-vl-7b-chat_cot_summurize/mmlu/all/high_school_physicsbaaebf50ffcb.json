A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite\u2019s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite\u2019s new orbit?\n\nA. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.\nB. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.\nC. The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.\nD.

            "content": "The satellite's speed has increased by 1%, which means its new speed is 101% of its original speed. This increase in speed will cause the satellite to move in a circle with a larger radius. The original orbit was just above the atmosphere, so the new orbit will also be just above the atmosphere. Therefore, the satellite's new orbit is a circle of larger radius.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
