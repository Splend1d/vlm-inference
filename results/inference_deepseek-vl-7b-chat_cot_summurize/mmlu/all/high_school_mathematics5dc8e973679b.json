He needs to choose 3 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (12 total marbles - 1 chosen red, green, or blue marble). There are 9 choices for the first marble, 8 choices for the second marble, and 7 choices for the third marble.\n\n3. To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of choices for each step: 3 * 9 * 8 * 7 = 1512.\n\nSo, there are 1512 ways for John to choose 4 marbles with exactly one of them being red, green, or blue.\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options.
