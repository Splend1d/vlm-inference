Since d people buy salad and p people buy soup, the total number of people is d + p. Each salad costs $3.99 and each soup costs $2.99, so the total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = (Number of salads * Cost per salad) + (Number of soups * Cost per soup)\nTotal cost = (d * $3.99) + (p * $2.99)\n\nComparing this expression to the given options, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3.99p + 2.99d",
