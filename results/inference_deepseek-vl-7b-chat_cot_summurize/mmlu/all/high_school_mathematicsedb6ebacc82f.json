            "content": "Let's denote the amplitude of the water level as A and the period of the tide as T.\n\nAt high tide, the water level is A, and at low tide, the water level is 0. Since the water level changes sinusoidally, we can write the equation for the water level as:\n\nL(t) = A * sin(2\u03c0t/T)\n\nAt 8 A.M., the water level is 15 feet, and at 2 P.M., the water level is 3 feet. We can find the period T by using the formula:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 / \u03c9\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency. We can find \u03c9 by using the formula:\n\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0 / T\n\nAt 8 A.M., the water level is 15 feet, and at 2 P.M., the water level is 3 feet. The time difference between these two points is 6 hours, so:\n\n6 = T\n\nNow we can find the angular frequency \u03c9:\n\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0 / 6 = \u03c0/3\n\nNow we can find the amplitude A:\n\nA = 15\n\nAt 8 A.M., the water level is 15 feet, and at 2 P.M., the water level is 3 feet. The water level drops by 12 feet in 6 hours. To find the rate of change per hour, we can use the formula:\n\nRate of change = (Final value - Initial value) / Time\n\nRate of change = (0 - 15) / 6 = -2.5 feet per hour\n\nNow we can find the rate of change per hour at noon:\n\nRate of change at noon = -2.5 * sin(\u03c0/3)\n\nRate of change at noon = -2.5 * (\u221a3/2)\n\nRate of change at noon = -3\u221a3/2\n\nSo, the water level was dropping at noon at a rate of 3\u221a3 feet per hour.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3\u221a3.",
