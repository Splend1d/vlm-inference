They are responsible for activating the transcription of specific genes by binding to regions near the gene and allowing an RNA polymerase to transcribe the gene. This process is essential for the production of proteins in the cell, as it allows the cell to produce the necessary proteins for its functions. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
