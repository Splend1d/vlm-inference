            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the following events:\n\n1. The first three dice show prime numbers and the last three dice show composite numbers.\n2. The first three dice show composite numbers and the last three dice show prime numbers.\n\nLet's first find the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of outcomes is 6^6 = 46656.\n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where the first three dice show prime numbers and the last three dice show composite numbers. There are 4 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7) and 5 composite numbers (4, 6, 8, 9, 10). The first three dice can show any combination of these 9 numbers, and the last three dice can show any combination of the remaining 3 numbers. So, there are 9 * 3 = 27 outcomes for this case.\n\nSimilarly, there are 27 outcomes where the first three dice show composite numbers and the last three dice show prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers is 27 + 27 = 54.\n\nThe probability of this event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = \\frac{54}{46656} = \\frac{54}{46656} = \\frac{1}{888}\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. There might be a mistake in the options provided.",
