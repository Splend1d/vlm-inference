The farmer decides to test H0: \u03bc = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : \u03bc > 4.0 ounces, at a 5 percent level of significance, where \u03bc = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer. The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?\n\nA. P(Z > 2)\nB. P(Z < 2)\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n",

            "content": "To calculate the p-value for this test, we will use the following formula:\n\nP(Z > z) = P(Z > (Z\u03b1/2))\n\nwhere Z\u03b1/2 is the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 5 percent level of significance. For a two-tailed test, the critical value is (Z\u03b1/2) = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nSince the farmer is testing H0: \u03bc = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : \u03bc > 4.0 ounces, we will use the critical value for the alternative hypothesis (\u03bc > 4.0 ounces) which is (Z\u03b1/2) = 1.96.\n\nNow, we will calculate the p-value:\n\nP(Z > 1.96) = P(Z > 1.96) = 0.05\n\nSo, the p-value for this test is 0.05.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. P(Z > 2).",
