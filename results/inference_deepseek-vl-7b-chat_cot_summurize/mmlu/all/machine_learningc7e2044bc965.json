            "content": "Statement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nThis statement is true. The linear regression estimator, which is the least squares estimator, has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators of a linear function of a random variable. This is a result of the properties of the least squares estimator, which is based on minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nThis statement is also true. In AdaBoost, the weights assigned to the training examples are non-negative and sum to 1. This is because AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm, which iteratively builds a weak learner (in this case, a classifier) that corrects the errors of the previous weak learner. The weights are used to balance the contribution of each training example to the final classifier. Since the weights are non-negative and sum to 1, the coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are also non-negative.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A.
