This is because the two variables are not linearly related; the number of hours studied does not increase in a predictable way as the number of hours studied for the second exam increases. The first exam had a standard deviation of 1 hour, while the second exam had a standard deviation of 10 hours, but this does not necessarily mean that the number of hours studied for the second exam is directly related to the number of hours studied for the first exam.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
