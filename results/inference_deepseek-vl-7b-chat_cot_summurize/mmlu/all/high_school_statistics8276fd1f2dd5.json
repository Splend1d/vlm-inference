            "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the Z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table. The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the data point, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of the population.\n\nMean (\u03bc) = (\u03a3X_i) / n\nStandard deviation (\u03c3) = \u221a[\u03a3(X_i - \u03bc)^2 / n]\n\nHowever, we don't have the actual data points for the population. Instead, we have a sample of 40 homes with an average building time of 83 days. We can use this sample to estimate the population parameters.\n\nSample mean (X\u0304) = 83\nSample standard deviation (s) = \u221a[\u03a3(X_i - X\u0304)^2 / (n - 1)]\n\nUsing the sample data:\n\nSample mean (X\u0304) = 83\nSample standard deviation (s) = \u221a[\u03a3(X_i - 83)^2 / (40 - 1)]\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days. We can use the standard normal distribution table to find the Z-scores for these values.\n\nZ(80) = (80 - 83) / \u221a[\u03a3(X_i - 83)^2 / (40 - 1)]\nZ(90) = (90 - 83) / \u221a[\u03a3(X_i - 83)^2 / (40 - 1)]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, we find that:\n\nZ(80) \u2248 -1.28\nZ(90) \u2248 1.28\n\nNow, we can use the Z-score formula to find the probability that the average building time is between 80 and 90 days:\n\nP(Z \u2264 1.28) = 0.9541\nP(Z \u2264 -1.28) = 0.0459\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that the average building time is between 80 and 90 days by subtracting the probabilities:\n\nP(80 \u2264 X\u0304 \u2264 90) = P(Z \u2264 1.28) - P(Z \u2264 -1.28)\nP(80 \u2264 X\u0304 \u2264 90) = 0.9541 - 0.0459 = 0.9082\n\nSo, with 90.82% confidence, we can assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days.\n\nThe answer is: B",
