This is because a maximal ideal is a prime ideal if and only if it is the intersection of all its proper ideals.\n\nStatement 2: If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is field.\nThis statement is false. While it is true that if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a domain (since it is a commutative ring with unity), it is not necessarily a field. A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. In general, R/I is not a field, as it may not have a multiplicative identity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, True.",
