The Cl2 molecule is much larger than F2 (atomic radius is 99 pm for chlorine and is 64 pm for fluorine). Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?\n\nA. Chlorine has a higher dipole moment than fluorine.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in Cl2 are much weaker than those in F2.\nC. The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of chlorine is much greater than the mass of fluorine.\n",
