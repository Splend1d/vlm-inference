Increases.\n\nWhen the federal deficit increases, it leads to an increase in the demand for loanable funds. This is because the government is borrowing more money to finance its spending, which increases the amount of money available for private borrowing. As a result, the demand for loanable funds increases.\n\nAn increase in the demand for loanable funds leads to an increase in the real interest rate. This is because when there is more demand for loans, lenders can charge higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk. As a result, the real interest rate increases.\n\nFinally, an increase in the real interest rate leads to an increase in investment spending. This is because when interest rates are high, it becomes more expensive for businesses to borrow money to invest in new projects. As a result, businesses are less likely to invest, and investment spending decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct direction of these effects is A.
