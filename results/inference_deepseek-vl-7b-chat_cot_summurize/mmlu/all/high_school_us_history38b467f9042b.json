            "content": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\nA.

            "content": "The passage above discusses the establishment of a boarding club for working girls, which was a response to the difficulties they faced during a strike in a large shoe factory. The club was meant to provide support and solidarity to the members, especially those who were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind financially. The club was self-managed by the members, and the settlement only provided the initial furniture and paid the first month's rent.\n\nThe political goal that this passage would most directly support is C. Greater rights for unions. The establishment of the boarding club was a response to the difficulties faced by the working girls during the strike, which indicates a need for better support and solidarity among workers. This could be seen as a call for greater rights for unions, as they would be able to provide such support and solidarity to their members.\n\nA. Women's suffrage is not directly addressed in the passage. While the passage does discuss the situation of working girls, it does not specifically mention women's suffrage.\n\nB. Trust-busting is not directly addressed in the passage. The passage does not discuss any specific trusts or the need to break them up.\n\nD. Weakening political machines is not directly addressed in the passage. The passage does not discuss any specific political machines or the need to weaken them.\n\nTherefore, the passage would most directly support the political goal of C. Greater rights for unions.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
