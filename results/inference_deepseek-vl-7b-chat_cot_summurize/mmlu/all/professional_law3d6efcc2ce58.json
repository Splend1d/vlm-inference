            "content": "A millionaire owned two adjacent 10-story commercial buildings. One building housed medical offices, and the other building housed dental offices. The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The buildings' other floors were rented to professionals and used as offices. There was an enclosed walkway that connected the second floor of each building. Thus, shoppers and office staff could walk across the common walkway and gain access to each building. While the buildings were being used in this manner, the millionaire sold the dental building to an investor by warranty deed, which made no mention of any rights concerning the walkway. The walkway continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. Thereafter, the walkway became unsafe as a consequence of wear and tear. As a result, the investor hired a contractor to repair the walkway area. When the millionaire saw the contractor removing the carpeting along the walkway, he demanded that the investor discontinue the repair work. After the investor refused, the millionaire brought an action to enjoin the investor from continuing the work. The most likely result will be a decision for\n\nA. the millionaire, because the investor does not have rights in the walkway.\nB. the millionaire, because the investor's rights in the dental building do not extend to the walkway.\nC. the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\nD. the investor, because he has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect himself from possible tort liability from persons using the walkway.\n",

            "content": "C. the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\n\nThe correct answer is C because the investor has an easement in the walkway, which means he has the right to use it for the purpose it was intended, in this case, for the benefit of both buildings. The warranty deed that transferred the dental building to the investor did not mention the walkway, but this does not affect the investor's rights to the walkway. The walkway was part of the dental building's common areas, and the investor has an implied right to keep it in repair to ensure the safety of the building's occupants and the public.\n\nA. is incorrect because the investor does have rights in the walkway, even though they were not mentioned in the warranty deed.\nB. is incorrect because the investor's rights in the dental building do extend to the walkway, as it was part of the building's common areas.\nD. is incorrect because the investor's right to repair the walkway is not based on potential tort liability, but rather on his implied right to keep the walkway in repair for the benefit of both buildings.",
