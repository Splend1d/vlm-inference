            "content": "To calculate the earnings per share (EPS), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of shares outstanding at the end of the year.\n2. Calculate the total revenue for the year.\n3. Calculate the total expenses for the year.\n4. Calculate the net income for the year.\n5. Divide the net income by the total number of shares outstanding to get the EPS.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Total number of shares outstanding at the end of the year:\n120000 shares (initial) + 40000 shares (issued) = 160000 shares\n\n2. Total revenue for the year:\nNet income for the year is $480000.\n\n3. Total expenses for the year:\nWe don't have the information about the expenses for the year, so we can't calculate the total expenses.\n\n4. Net income for the year:\nNet income = Total revenue - Total expenses\nNet income = $480000\n\n5. Earnings per share (EPS):\nEPS = Net income / Total number of shares outstanding\nEPS = $480000 / 160000 = $3.00\n\nSo, Toft should report earnings per share of $3.00 for the year. The correct answer is C. $3.00.",
