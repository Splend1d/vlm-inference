            "content": "To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nA. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\nB. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\nC. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\nD. The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n",

The plaintiff does not need to prove that the ordinance is not necessary or that it does not serve a compelling state interest, but rather that it is not substantially related to an important state interest.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The city does not need to prove that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, as the plaintiff is not challenging the necessity of the ordinance.\nB. The city does not need to prove that the ordinance will have a disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons, as the plaintiff is not challenging the impact of the ordinance.\nD. The city does not need to prove that the ordinance is within state regulatory authority, as the plaintiff is not challenging the authority of the ordinance.",
