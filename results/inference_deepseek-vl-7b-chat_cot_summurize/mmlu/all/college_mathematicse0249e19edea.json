            "content": "Let the length of the yard be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are given that the total fencing is $2l + 2w = x$. We want to maximize the area of the yard, which is given by $A = lw$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation for the fencing as $l = x/2 - w$. Substituting this into the area equation, we get $A = (x/2 - w)w = xw/2 - w^2/2$.\n\nTo maximize the area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of $A$ with respect to $w$ and setting it equal to 0.\n\n$\\frac{dA}{dw} = \\frac{x}{2} - 2w = 0$\n\nSolving for $w$, we get $w = \\frac{x}{4}$. Substituting this back into the equation for $l$, we get $l = \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{x}{4}$.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the yard that maximize the area are $l = \\frac{x}{4}$ and $w = \\frac{x}{4}$. The maximum area is then $A = \\frac{x^2}{16}$.\n\nComparing this to the options given, the maximum possible area of the yard is $\\boxed{\\text{B. } x^2/8}$.",
