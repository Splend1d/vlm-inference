A considerable amount of energy still remains in ethanol, yet ethanol is a waste product for the yeast cells that produce it. What, then, is the purpose of fermentation?\n\nA. Fermentation provides CO2 for photosynthesis.\nB. Fermentation provides CO2 for cellular respiration.\nC. Yeast cells excrete ethanol in order to provide a defense against invading bacteria.\nD. Fermentation replenishes the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue.\n",
