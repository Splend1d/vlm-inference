The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\nB. The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\nC. The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.\nD. The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.\n",
