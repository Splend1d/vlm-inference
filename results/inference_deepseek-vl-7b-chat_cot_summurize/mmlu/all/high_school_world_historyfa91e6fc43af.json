To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations\nD. That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects\n",

            "content": "The first passage can be said to undermine the commonly held assumption about Western imperialism that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. This is because the passage suggests that while the British Empire in India had the power to end the practice of sati, they were also aware of the potential consequences of doing so, such as risking the safety of the British Empire. The British considered the practice of sati to be repugnant, but they also recognized the need to maintain control over the Indian population through economic means, rather than imposing their cultural norms.\n\nThe second passage reinforces this point by suggesting that the best way to keep the Indian population in a state of subordination was to make them dependent on the foodstuffs and manufactured goods that the British Empire provided. This implies that the British were more concerned with maintaining their economic control over the Indian population than with imposing their cultural norms.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.",
