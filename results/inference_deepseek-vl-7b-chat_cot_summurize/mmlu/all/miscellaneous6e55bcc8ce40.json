I would work without a net and without the noise of the crowd to disturb me. The view from on high is dizzying, instructive. I do not record the world exactly as it comes to me but transform it by making it pass through a prism of fabulous stories I have collected on the way. I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?\n\nA. The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.\nB. The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.\nC. The author makes a comparison between his own experiences and that of others in his profession.\nD. The author chronicles the various phases of his work in a particular discipline.\n",

            "content": "The passage is a reflection on the author's writing process and the way he interprets the world around him. The author uses a metaphor to describe his approach to writing, likening it to a lepidopterist collecting rare moths or Costa Rican beetles, or a storyteller interpreting the world through a prism of stories. The author does not explicitly state his reasons for taking a certain course of action, nor does he compare his experiences to those of others in his profession. He also does not chronicle the various phases of his work in a particular discipline. Instead, he focuses on explaining his own life and writing process, inviting readers to join him on this journey.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the organization of the passage is:\n\nA. The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.",
