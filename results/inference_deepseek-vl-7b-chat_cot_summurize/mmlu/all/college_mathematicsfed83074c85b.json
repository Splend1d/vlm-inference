The area of each disk is \u03c0(x^2 - x^2) = \u03c0x^2.\n\nNow, we integrate the area of the cross-sectional slices from x = 0 to x = 1:\n\nVolume = \u222b[0, 1] \u03c0x^2 dx = \u03c0 \u222b[0, 1] x^2 dx = \u03c0 (x^3/3) | from 0 to 1\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nVolume = \u03c0 (1^3/3 - 0^3/3) = \u03c0 (1/3)\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid of revolution is \u03c0/3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.",
