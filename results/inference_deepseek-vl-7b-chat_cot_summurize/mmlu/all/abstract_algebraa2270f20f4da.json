This is because the direct product of two cyclic groups is still cyclic, as each element of the direct product can be written as a product of elements from the two cyclic groups.\n\nStatement 2: The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12.\nThis statement is also true. The external direct product of D_3 and D_4, which are both dihedral groups, is indeed isomorphic to D_12, the dihedral group of order 12. This can be shown by finding the generators of the three groups and showing that the relations between the generators are the same in all three groups.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
