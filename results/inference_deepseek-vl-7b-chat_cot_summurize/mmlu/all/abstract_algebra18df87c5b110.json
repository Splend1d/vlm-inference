            "content": "Statement 1: A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.\n\nThis statement is true. A homomorphism is a function that preserves the structure of a group. If a homomorphism is one-to-one (also known as injective), it means that each element in the domain group is mapped to a unique element in the codomain group. In this case, the kernel (the set of elements that map to the identity in the codomain) would consist of only the identity element, as no other element can map to the identity.\n\nStatement 2: The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.\n\nThis statement is also true. The image of a group under a homomorphism is the set of all elements in the codomain that can be obtained by applying the homomorphism to elements of the domain. If the domain group has 6 elements, and the codomain group has a smaller size, it is possible for the image of the homomorphism to have fewer elements. For example, if the codomain is a group of order 4, the image of the group of 6 elements could have at most 4 elements.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
