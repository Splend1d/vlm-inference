After a time, the dogs salivated in response to the presenter (UCR).\n\nThis is the correct answer because it correctly describes the components of Ivan Pavlov's research on conditioning. Pavlov's research involved presenting dogs with food (CS) and then with the sights and sounds of the experimenter (UCS). After a while, the dogs would salivate in response to the experimenter (UCR), indicating that the neutral stimulus (UCS) had become a conditioned stimulus (CS) through repeated association with the unconditioned stimulus (CS).",
