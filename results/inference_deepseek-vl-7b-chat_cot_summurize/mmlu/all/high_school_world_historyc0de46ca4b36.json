A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nThe passage is most clearly an example of which of the following?\n\nA. Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa\nB. A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa\nC. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world\nD. Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa\n",

It suggests that the greatest contribution Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid disunity and create a political union. This union, according to the author, will project a stronger African personality, command respect from the rest of the world, and serve as an example to a divided world. The passage does not focus on failed unification attempts, a plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa, or opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa. Therefore, the correct answer is C. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world.",
