            "content": "In 1993, a farmer had good record title to a farm in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. Before the professor had paid the rancher and taken his deed, the professor visited the farm and observed the fence. However, the teacher was not present when the professor visited the property, and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094f anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The professor then recorded the deed. Note: This jurisdiction uses Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Indices and has no Tract IndexThe jurisdiction's recording act provides: \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. \"In 2008, in an action to quiet title to the farm, which of the following parties would have priority of title?\n\nA. The professor.\nB. The investor.\nC. The teacher.\nD. The rancher.\n",

In 2007, the rancher sold the farm to the professor for $25,000, but the professor did not record the deed.\n\nThe investor bought the farm from the farmer in 1998 and recorded the deed, which is the first conveyance that is recorded.

Therefore, the rancher's deed is not valid against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration.\n\nThe professor bought the farm from the rancher in 2007, but the professor did not record the deed. Therefore, the professor's deed is not valid against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration.\n\nIn 2008, the action to quiet title to the farm would be between the investor and the teacher, as they are the parties with valid recorded deeds against the professor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
