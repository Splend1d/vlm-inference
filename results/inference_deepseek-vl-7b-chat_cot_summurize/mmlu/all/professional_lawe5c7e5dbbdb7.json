            "content": "A man, his brother and his friend all discuss murdering the man's neighbor because the neighbor took some shots at the man's dog but he missed. They agree on a plan. They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, \"I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder.\" The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this scenario, all three men are involved in a criminal conspiracy to murder the neighbor. The man and his brother went ahead with the plan and attempted to poison the neighbor, which is an overt act that constitutes a criminal conspiracy. The friend, although not directly involved in the act of poisoning, was part of the planning and provided advice on how to obtain the poison. This also constitutes a criminal conspiracy. Therefore, all three men are guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n\nThe attempted murder charge is also applicable because the man and his brother attempted to carry out the plan to poison the neighbor, which is an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the man and his brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder, as stated above.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the friend is not guilty of nothing. He is guilty of criminal conspiracy as well.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the friend is not only guilty of criminal conspiracy but also attempted murder, as he was part of the planning and provided advice on how to obtain the poison.",
