The statute does not, however, restrict the sale of red meat products. Producers of red meat have challenged the statute as a violation of their free speech rights protected by the First Amendment. Is the court likely to find the statute constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it does not serve a substantial government interest.\nB. No, because it is more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest in preventing certain cancers.\nC. Yes, because it does not affect speech protected by the First Amendment.\nD. Yes, because it serves a legitimate government interest in protecting public health.\n",
