(M \u2261 ~N) is true when M is false and N is true. In this case, M / N is also true.\n2. (M \u2261 ~N) is true when M is true and N is false. In this case, M / N is also true.\n3. (M \u2261 ~N) is true when M is false and N is false. In this case, M / N is also true.\n4. (M \u2261 ~N) is true when M is true and N is true. In this case, M / N is also true.\n\nSince the argument (M \u2261 ~N) is true for all possible combinations of truth values for M and N, the argument is valid.\n\nHowever, the statement M / N is not always true for the given argument. For example, when M is true and N is false, the argument (M \u2261 ~N) is true, but M / N is false. Therefore, the argument is valid, but the statement M / N is not always true.",
