We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area to the left of the z-score (since we want the probability of being less than 100,000 miles, we need to find the area to the left of the z-score).\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of z = 2.0833 is approximately 0.0667.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles, is approximately 0.0667 or 6.67%.\n\nHowever, since the options are not in decimal form, we can round this value to the nearest whole number. In this case, the closest whole number is 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0.34.",
