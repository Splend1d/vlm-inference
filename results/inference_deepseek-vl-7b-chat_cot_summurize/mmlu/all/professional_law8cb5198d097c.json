            "content": "A husband and wife owned and operated a grocery store. The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store. The defendant picked up the package, which contained baked bread that had been delivered earlier in the evening, and the defendant then ran off. Which of the following crimes will the defendant most likely be convicted of?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Burglary.\nC. Larceny and attempted burglary.\nD. Larceny and burglary.\n",

The defendant entered the property without permission (attempted burglary) by going through the back yard and attempting to pry open the back window of the grocery store.\n2. The defendant stole the money from the cigar box (larceny) after he entered the store.\n\nTherefore, the defendant is guilty of both larceny and attempted burglary, making options C and D incorrect. Option A is incorrect because the defendant did not actually steal anything from the store, he only intended to do so. Option B is correct because the defendant attempted to enter the store (burglary) and then stole the money (larceny).",
