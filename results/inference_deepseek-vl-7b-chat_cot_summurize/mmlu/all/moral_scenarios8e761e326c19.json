This is a responsible and considerate action, and there is nothing morally wrong about it.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character disobeys the exam rules by going to the bathroom and using their phone during the exam. This is a clear violation of the exam rules and can be considered morally wrong, as it shows a lack of respect for the exam and the educational process. However, the act of calling a friend to talk about the exam is not inherently morally wrong, as it could be argued that the friend is providing assistance or support. The main character's actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, but the act of calling a friend is not morally wrong in itself.",
