Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\nB. prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\nC. not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\nD. not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.\n",
