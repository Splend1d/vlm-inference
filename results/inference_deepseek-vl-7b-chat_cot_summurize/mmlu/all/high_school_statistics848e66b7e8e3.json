            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of percentiles. The percentiles represent the percentage of people who scored below a certain score. For example, the 64th percentile means that 64% of the people scored lower than the person in question.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mary scored eight more points than Pam.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The percentiles only tell us the relative positions of the scores, not the exact scores. Mary could have scored 8 points more than Pam, or she could have scored 8 points less. We cannot determine this from the given information.\n\nB. Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The percentiles only tell us the relative positions of the scores, not the exact scores. Mary's score could be 8% higher, but it could also be 8% lower. We cannot determine this from the given information.\n\nC. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The percentiles only tell us the relative positions of the scores, not the exact scores. It is possible that 8% of the people scored between Pam and Mary, but it is also possible that 8% of the people scored below Mary and above Pam. We cannot determine this from the given information.\n\nD. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\nThis statement is true. The 64th percentile means that 64% of the people scored lower than Mary, and the 56th percentile means that 56% of the people scored lower than Pam. Therefore, the remaining 100% - 64% - 56% = 20% of the people scored higher than both Mary and Pam. Since there are 100% of the people who took the test, it follows that 20% of them scored higher than both Mary and Pam, which is 36 people.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
