When a cannonball is fired horizontally, it experiences no vertical acceleration (since it is fired from a cliff, it will not gain or lose height). Therefore, its horizontal velocity (speed) remains constant.\n\nThe initial speed of the cannonball is 10 m/s. Since there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, the speed one second after being fired will also be 10 m/s.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 10 m/s",
