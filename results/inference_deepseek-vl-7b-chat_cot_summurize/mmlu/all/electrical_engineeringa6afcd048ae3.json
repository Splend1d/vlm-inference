This is because the RL combination can exhibit inductive reactance when the current flows through the inductor, which can cause the current to rise sharply and the voltage to drop. This characteristic is similar to the behavior of a full bridge inverter under load commutation mode.\n\nThe other options (RLC underdamped, RLC overdamped, and RLC critically damped) are not suitable for load commutation mode because they do not exhibit the necessary characteristics to cause the current to rise sharply and the voltage to drop.",
