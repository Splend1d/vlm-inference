To find the total number of books he will read, we can divide the total number of weeks by the number of weeks it takes to read each book.\n\nTotal number of weeks = 12\nNumber of weeks per book = 2\n\nTotal number of books = Total number of weeks / Number of weeks per book\nTotal number of books = 12 / 2\nTotal number of books = 6\n\nSo, Ty will read a total of 6 books.
