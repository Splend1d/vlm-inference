The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe passage above is most associated with which of the following developments?\n\nA.

The text emphasizes the importance of peace and the need for Asia and Africa to unite and mobilize their spiritual, moral, and political strength on the side of peace. This aligns with the principles of the non-aligned movement, which was established in 1954 to promote peace, independence, and self-determination for developing countries and to oppose the domination of any one group or ideology. The other options (global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, the Green Revolution in agriculture, and mobilization of pan-Asian ideology) are not directly related to the main theme of the passage.",
