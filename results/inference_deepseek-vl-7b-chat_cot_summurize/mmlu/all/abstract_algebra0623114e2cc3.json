A field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy the properties of a ring. Therefore, every field is indeed a ring.\n\nStatement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity. This statement is also true. In the context of rings, a multiplicative identity is an element that, when multiplied by any element of the ring, leaves that element unchanged. Every ring has at least one multiplicative identity, which is typically denoted by the symbol '1'.",
