Then, the length of the rectangle is $2w$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal:\n\n$d^2 = w^2 + (2w)^2$\n\n$d^2 = w^2 + 4w^2$\n\n$d^2 = 5w^2$\n\nGiven that the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$, we can set up the equation:\n\n$5\\sqrt{5} = 5w^2$\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{5} = w^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$w = \\sqrt{5}$\n\nNow, we can find the area of the rectangle:\n\n$A = w \\times 2w$\n\n$A = \\sqrt{5} \\times 2\\sqrt{5}$\n\n$A = 5$\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 5, which corresponds to option C.",
