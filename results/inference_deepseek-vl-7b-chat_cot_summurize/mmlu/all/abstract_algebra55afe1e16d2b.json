In this case, n = 10.\n\nSo, the maximum possible order for an element of S_10 is 10^(10-1) = 10^9.\n\nComparing this to the options given:\n\nA. 6\nB. 12\nC. 30\nD. 105\n\nThe maximum possible order is 10^9, which is not listed in the options. However, if we consider the next largest option, which is 10^8 (10000000), we can see that it is not listed in the options either. The next largest option is 10^7 (1000000), which is not listed either.\n\nSince none of the options match the maximum possible order, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the options.",
