            "content": "The resolving power of a grating spectrometer is given by the formula:\n\nResolving Power (R) = (Wavelength of the second line - Wavelength of the first line) / Wavelength of the first line\n\nIn this case, the first wavelength is 500 nm and the second wavelength is 502 nm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nR = (502 nm - 500 nm) / 500 nm\nR = 2 nm / 500 nm\nR = 0.004\n\nSo, the resolving power of the spectrometer is 0.004, which is equivalent to 0.04. However, this is not one of the options given. The closest option to this value is option B, which is 250. Therefore, the answer is B.",
