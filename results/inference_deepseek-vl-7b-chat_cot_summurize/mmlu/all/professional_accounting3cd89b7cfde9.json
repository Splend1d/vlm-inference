            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of perpetuity. A perpetuity is an investment that generates a constant amount of cash flow forever. The formula to calculate the value of a perpetuity is:\n\nValue = Cash Flow / (r - g)\n\nwhere:\n- Value is the value of the investment\n- Cash Flow is the constant cash flow generated by the investment\n- r is the market discount rate (15% in this case)\n- g is the growth rate of the investment (5% in this case)\n\nGiven that the investment's next payout is $10, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nValue = $10 / (0.15 - 0.05)\n\nValue = $10 / 0.10\n\nValue = $100\n\nSo, the value of the investment is $100.
