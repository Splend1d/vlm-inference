            "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the population mean (\u03bc), which is 4 ounces in this case. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the population standard deviation (\u03c3) divided by the square root of the sample size (n):\n\nStandard deviation of the sampling distribution = \u03c3 / \u221an\nStandard deviation of the sampling distribution = 0.25 / \u221a40\nStandard deviation of the sampling distribution = 0.25 / 2\nStandard deviation of the sampling distribution = 0.125\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 3.9 ounces. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\nz = (3.9 - 4) / 0.125\nz = -0.1 / 0.125\nz = -0.8\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -0.8. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability. Using a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score less than -0.8 is approximately 0.0225.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces is approximately 0.0225, which corresponds to option B.",
