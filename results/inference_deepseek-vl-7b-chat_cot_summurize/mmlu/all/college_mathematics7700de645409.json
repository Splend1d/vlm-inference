The displacement of the particle is given by the vector (t, t^2, t^3).\n\nThe component of F in the direction of the displacement is given by the dot product of F and the displacement vector:\n\nF_x = F_x(t, t^2, t^3) = F_x(t, t^2, t^3)\n\nSince F is a constant unit force parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1), its components are F_x = -1, F_y = 0, and F_z = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the dot product of F and the displacement vector:\n\nF_x(t, t^2, t^3) = -1 * t + (-1 * t^2) + 1 * t^3 = -t^2 + t^3\n\nNow, we need to find the work done by F on the particle between time t=0 and time t=1. The work done is given by the integral of the force component F_x over the interval [0, 1]:\n\nW = \u222b(F_x(t, t^2, t^3) dt) from 0 to 1\n\nW = \u222b(-t^2 + t^3) dt from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral:\n\nW = [-t^3/3 + t^4/4] from 0 to 1\n\nW = [-1/3 + 1/4] = -1/12\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options.
