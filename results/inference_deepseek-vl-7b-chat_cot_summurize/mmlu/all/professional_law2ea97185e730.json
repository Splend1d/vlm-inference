            "content": "A state enacted a statute prohibiting any motor vehicle traveling within the state from having window tinting or glass coating of any kind. The bill passed the state legislature at the urging of state and local law enforcement agencies who argued that tinted windows prevented them from observing interior car activity. Most citizens also supported the bill, especially after a state trooper was killed by an occupant in a window-tinted limousine. The trooper was unable to see that his assailant was armed and dangerous when he approached the vehicle for a speeding infraction. A limousine company operates a limo service in a neighboring state and has a fleet of 68 limos, all of which have tinted windows. Each year, the company makes thousands of trips into the state to transport passengers to the international airport situated 10 miles from the border separating the two states. Since all of its limos are manufactured with tinted windows, the company will incur great expense in ordering limos without tinting. The company brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of the state statute. Assuming that the company has proper standing to assert such an action, which of the following is their strongest constitutional argument to invalidate the aforesaid statute?\n\nA. Because window tinting is permitted on vehicles in neighboring states, this law denies the company the equal protection of laws.\nB. Because this law burdens interstate commerce by prohibiting all vehicles with window tinting from entering the state, this law violates the commerce clause.\nC. Because window tinting on vehicles is legal in their home state, this law violates the contract clause by preventing the company from fulfilling its obligation to transport passengers into a neighboring state.\nD. Because interstate travel is a fundamental right that may not be burdened by state law, it violates the company's substantive due process rights by arbitrarily and unreasonably regulating economic activity.\n",

            "content": "The strongest constitutional argument for the company to invalidate the statute would be that it violates the commerce clause. The commerce clause in the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, between the states, and with Indian tribes. The company's argument would be that by prohibiting all vehicles with window tinting from entering the state, the statute is unduly burdening interstate commerce. This is because the company operates a limo service that transports passengers between states, and the statute would require them to either remove the tinting on their vehicles or face significant expenses in ordering new limos without tinting. This burden on their business is a direct result of the state's regulation of interstate commerce.\n\nThe other options do not present as strong a constitutional argument. The equal protection clause would only apply if the company can show that the state is treating them differently than similar businesses in neighboring states, which is not the case here. The contract clause would only apply if the company has a contractual obligation to transport passengers into the state, which is not mentioned in the question. The substantive due process clause would only apply if the statute is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest, which is not the case here either. The statute is clearly aimed at preventing law enforcement from being unable to see interior car activity, which is a legitimate state interest.",
