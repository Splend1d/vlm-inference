            "content": "Let's denote the event that Alfred asks Charlene as A, the event that Ben asks Charlene as B, and the event that neither Alfred nor Ben asks Charlene as N.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.6\nP(B) = 0.18\nP(N) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - 0.6 - 0.18 = 0.22\n\nWe are also given the probability that at least one of them will ask her, which is 0.72. This can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of A and B:\n\nP(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.6 + 0.18 = 0.78\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that Ben asks Charlene, which is P(B). To do this, we can use the following equation:\n\nP(B) = P(A \u2228 B) - P(N)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nP(B) = 0.78 - 0.22 = 0.56\n\nSo, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.56, which is not listed in the options provided. However, since the answer choices are not given in increasing order of probability, we can assume that the closest answer is the closest to 0.56. In this case, the closest answer is 0.78, which is not the correct answer. Therefore, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is not given in the options.",
