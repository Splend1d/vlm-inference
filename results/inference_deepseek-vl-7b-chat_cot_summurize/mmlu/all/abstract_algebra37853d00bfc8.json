The cycle index is a polynomial expression that represents the cycle structure of a permutation.\n\nThe permutation p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) can be written as a product of disjoint cycles:\n\np = (1, 2, 5)(2, 3) = (1, 2)(5, 3) = (1, 3)(2, 5)\n\nNow, we can find the cycle index of p by finding the cycle structure of each cycle and multiplying the cycle indices together.\n\nFor the cycle (1, 3):\n\nCycle index = (1, 3) = (1^2, 3^1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nFor the cycle (2, 5):\n\nCycle index = (2, 5) = (2^1, 5^1) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nNow, we multiply the cycle indices together:\n\nCycle index of p = (4)(7) = 28\n\nSo, the index of <p> in S_5 is 28.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
