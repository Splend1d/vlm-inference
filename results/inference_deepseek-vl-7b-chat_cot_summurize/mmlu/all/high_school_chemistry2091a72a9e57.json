CH3NH2 (ammonia) can form hydrogen bonds. \n\nHydrogen bonds are formed between hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms (usually oxygen or nitrogen) and other electronegative atoms. In this case, ammonia (CH3NH2) has a nitrogen atom with a high electronegative capacity, which can form hydrogen bonds.\n\nA. CH3OCH2CH3 (ethanol) can also form hydrogen bonds, but it is less likely than ammonia because it has a lower electronegative capacity.\n\nB. HCN (hydrogen cyanide) is a weak base and can form hydrogen bonds, but it is less common than ammonia and ethanol.\n\nC. CH3OCH2Br (ethanol with a bromine atom attached) cannot form hydrogen bonds because the bromine atom is not electronegative enough to form hydrogen bonds.",
