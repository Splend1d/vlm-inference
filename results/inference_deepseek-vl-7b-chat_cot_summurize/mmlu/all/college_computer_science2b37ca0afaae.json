The common divisors are the divisors that are common to both 6 and 12. \n\nLooking at the sets provided, we can see that set D is the only set that contains all the common divisors of 6 and 12. \n\nTherefore, the set of all common divisors of two integers is {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12}.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
