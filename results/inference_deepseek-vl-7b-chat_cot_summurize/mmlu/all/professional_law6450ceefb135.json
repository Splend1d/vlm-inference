According to the contract, settlement (or closing) was to take place on March 1 of the same year. On January 20, a barn on the property was destroyed by fire. When the buyer was notified of the loss the following day, he contacted the seller and told him that the deal was off because of the fire. As a result, the buyer filed suit against the seller on January 25 for a refund of his down payment of $5,000. In his suit, the buyer will be unsuccessful and will be obliged to complete the contract if the court determines that on January 20\n\nA. the buyer held the legal title to the farm.\nB. the seller held the legal title to the farm.\nC. the buyer held the equitable title to the farm.\nD. the seller held the equitable title to the farm.\n",

            "content": "The question is asking for the legal status of the farm on January 20, when the fire occurred. The options provided are:\n\nA. the buyer held the legal title to the farm.\nB. the seller held the legal title to the farm.\nC. the buyer held the equitable title to the farm.\nD. the seller held the equitable title to the farm.\n\nThe legal title to a property is the right to possess and control the property, which is usually transferred through a deed or other legal documents. The equitable title, on the other hand, is the right to possess and control the property in the absence of a legal title, such as when there is a cloud on the title (e.g., a lien, a pending lawsuit, or a fire).\n\nIn this case, the contract of sale was in place, and the buyer had made a down payment of $5,000. This indicates that the buyer had the legal title to the farm, as the down payment is typically made to secure the legal transfer of the property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the buyer held the legal title to the farm.",
