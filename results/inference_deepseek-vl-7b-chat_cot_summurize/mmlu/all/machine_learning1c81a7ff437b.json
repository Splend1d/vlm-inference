In gradient descent, we typically update our parameters (weights or biases) by taking a step in the opposite direction of the gradient. This operation involves computing the dot product of the gradient and the current parameters, and then updating the parameters by a certain learning rate.\n\nLet's denote the number of features (or input dimensions) as D, and the number of training examples as N. The gradient of the cost function is a vector of length D, and the parameters we are updating are also a vector of length D.\n\n1. Computing the dot product of the gradient and the parameters: This operation has a time complexity of O(D).\n2. Updating the parameters: This operation involves a single scalar multiplication and a single assignment operation, both of which have a time complexity of O(1).\n\nTherefore, the total time complexity of one gradient descent update is O(D) + O(1) = O(D).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
