            "content": "A landlord owned an apartment which he leased to a college senior for a three-year term beginning December 1, 2007, for a monthly rental of $1,000 to be payable on the first of each month. After the college senior resided in the apartment for six months, he assigned his interest in the premises to a college junior on June 1,2008. The college junior paid the rental on the apartment for two months and then assigned his interest to a college sophomore. The sophomore took possession on August 1, 2008 and paid the rental for August but did not pay the rental for the next three months of occupancy. Then on December 1, 2008 the college sophomore assigned the premises to a college freshman who took possession but didn't pay any rental to the landlord during the period of his occupancy from December 1,2008 to April 1,2009. On April 5, 2009, the landlord brings an action against the college freshman to recover the outstanding rent that is due on the premises. The freshman is most likely liable for\n\nA. $8,000. 00\nB. $7,000. 00\nC. $5,000. 00\nD. $4,000. 00\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. $8,000.00.\n\nThe landlord leased the apartment to the college senior for a three-year term beginning December 1, 2007, at a monthly rental of $1,000. The college senior resided in the apartment for six months and then assigned his interest to the college junior. The college junior paid the rental for two months and then assigned his interest to the college sophomore. The sophomore took possession on August 1, 2008, and paid the rental for August but did not pay the rental for the next three months of occupancy. The college freshman took possession on December 1, 2008, and did not pay any rental to the landlord during the period of his occupancy from December 1, 2008, to April 1, 2009.\n\nThe total outstanding rent due on the premises at the time of the landlord's action against the college freshman is $8,000.00. The college freshman is liable for this amount because he took possession of the premises after the college junior and college sophomore had already failed to pay the rent. The college freshman did not pay any rent during his occupancy, so he is responsible for the outstanding rent from the college junior's occupancy (two months) and the college sophomore's occupancy (three months).",
