Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nWhich of the following observations about revolutions and gender is best supported by the first passage?\n\nA. Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.\nB. Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution.\nC. Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them.\nD. Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.\n",

            "content": "The first passage, written by Olympe de Gouges in 1791, addresses the rights of women and the Revolution. It emphasizes the need for women to wake up and recognize their rights, and it criticizes the enslaved man for becoming unjust to his companion after gaining freedom. This passage suggests that the author believes women should be more involved in the revolution and that they should fight for their rights.\n\nThe second passage, from an interview with Halima Ghomri in the 1970s, discusses the situation of women in Algeria after the war of independence. The speaker mentions that while they are now free and can work without fear, nothing has changed in terms of education and economic status. This suggests that the speaker believes that revolutions do not necessarily lead to significant improvements for women.\n\nComparing these two passages, it seems that the first passage supports the idea that revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights, as it emphasizes the need for women to fight for their rights and the fact that they have not received the benefits they expected from the Revolution. The second passage supports the idea that women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them, as it describes the situation of women in Algeria after the war of independence as unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the observation that is best supported by the first passage is: Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
