            "content": "Statement 1: The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements. This statement is true. The image of a group under a homomorphism is the set of all images of the elements of the group under the homomorphism. If the group has 6 elements, the image of the group under the homomorphism could have any number of elements, including 12.\n\nStatement 2: There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. This statement is also true. Homomorphisms are always possible between groups. For example, consider the group of integers modulo 6 under addition, which has 6 elements, and the group of integers modulo 12 under addition, which has 12 elements. There is a homomorphism from the first group to the second group that sends each integer modulo 6 to the corresponding integer modulo 12.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.
