In our case, we have the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c).\n\nSince Z_3[x] is a commutative ring, the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is also commutative. Therefore, we need to check if the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c has a unity element.\n\nLet's consider the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c = x^3 + x^2 + 0. Since x^3 + x^2 is a monic polynomial, it has a unity element. In this case, the unity element is 1.\n\nNow, we need to check if the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c has a unity element for all c in Z_3. Let's consider the cases:\n\n1. c = 0: x^3 + x^2 + 0 = x^3 + x^2, which is a monic polynomial and has a unity element.\n\n2. c = 1: x^3 + x^2 + 1 = x^3 + x^2 + 0, which is a monic polynomial and has a unity element.\n\n3. c = 2: x^3 + x^2 + 2 = x^3 + x^2 + 0, which is a monic polynomial and has a unity element.\n\nFor all c in Z_3 = {0, 1, 2}, the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c has a unity element, and thus the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. 0\nB. 2\nC. 1\nD. 3",
