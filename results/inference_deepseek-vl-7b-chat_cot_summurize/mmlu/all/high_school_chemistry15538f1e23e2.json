Convert the given mass of mercury(II) oxide to moles.\n2. Calculate the moles of oxygen gas that will form.\n\nStep 1: Convert the mass of mercury(II) oxide to moles\n4.32 g * (1 mol / 216 g mol^-1) = 0.02 mol\n\nStep 2: Calculate the moles of oxygen gas that will form\nSince the reaction is 1 mole of mercury(II) oxide decomposes to 1 mole of oxygen gas, we can directly say that 1 mole of oxygen gas will form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 0.100 mol.",
