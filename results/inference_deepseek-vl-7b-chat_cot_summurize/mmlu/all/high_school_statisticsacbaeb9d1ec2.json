The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\nThis is because the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normally distributed when the population is normally distributed. In this case, the population is strongly skewed right, but the sample size is large (16), which means the sample mean will be close to the population mean (210 mg/dL) and the standard deviation of the sample mean will be close to the population standard deviation (15 mg/dL).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The shape is unknown - This is not true, as the shape of the sampling distribution is approximately normal.\n\nB. The shape is somewhat skewed right - This is not true, as the population is strongly skewed right, but the sample mean will be close to the population mean and the standard deviation of the sample mean will be close to the population standard deviation.\n\nD. The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75 - This is incorrect because the standard deviation of the sample mean will be close to the population standard deviation, not 3.75.",
