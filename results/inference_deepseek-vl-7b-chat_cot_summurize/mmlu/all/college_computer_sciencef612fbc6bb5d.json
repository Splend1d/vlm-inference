Once a process has been granted a resource, the process has exclusive use of that resource until it is released. If a process requests a resource that is already in use, the process enters a queue for that resource, waiting until the resource is available. Which of the following will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock?\n\nA. Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority\nB. Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all\nC. Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number\nD. Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting\n",
