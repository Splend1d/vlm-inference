By definition, a free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements without any common divisors other than 1. Since there are no divisors other than 1, it is clear that a free abelian group is also torsion-free.\n\nStatement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\nThis statement is false. While it is true that every finitely generated abelian group is torsion-free, it is not necessarily true that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group. For example, consider the direct sum of two copies of the integers, which is a finitely generated torsion-free abelian group but not a free abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
