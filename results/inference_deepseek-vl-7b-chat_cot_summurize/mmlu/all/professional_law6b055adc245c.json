Any violation or noncompliance with said statute shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than three years nor more than seven years. \"The defendant was involved in an accident that involved injuries to the other driver. The defendant, however, knowing his license to be revoked and afraid of being arrested, fled the scene. However, the victim was able to write down the license number of the defendant's vehicle, and the defendant was rapidly apprehended and put in jail. The defendant is charged with violating the aforementioned statute. He files a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the disclosure requirement of the statute violates his privilege against self-incrimination. His motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the statute makes no provision for Miranda warnings concerning his right to remain silent.\nB. granted, because the statute requires him to provide incriminating information that can be used againsthim in a criminal prosecution.\nC. denied, because the legislative intent in enacting the statute was designed to require disclosure of information to be used primarily in civil litigation.\nD. denied, because in accordance with public policy considerations, the required disclosures are insufficiently testimonial.\n",

This information can be used against him in a criminal prosecution for hit-and-run, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for not less than three years nor more than seven years.\n\nThe defendant's privilege against self-incrimination is a constitutional right that protects individuals from being compelled to testify against themselves in a criminal prosecution. In this case, the defendant's license was revoked, and he was aware that providing his personal information could lead to his arrest and imprisonment. Therefore, the disclosure requirement of the statute is considered incriminating information that can be used against him in a criminal prosecution, and his motion to dismiss should be granted.",
