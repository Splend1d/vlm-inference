If there is no such appointment in a will, in equal shares to any surviving children of her grandchild. When the grandchild dies, she is in debt. Can the creditors attach the house?\n\nA. Yes, because of the rule in Shelly's case.\nB. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\nC. Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.\nD. No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.v\n",
