            "content": "A. Money demand is nearly perfectly elastic.\n\nIf money demand is nearly perfectly elastic, it means that the quantity of money demanded by households and firms is directly proportional to the interest rate. In this case, a central bank cannot lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, as doing so would not increase the quantity of money demanded. This would limit the ability of the central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy.\n\nB. Investment demand is nearly perfectly elastic.\n\nIf investment demand is nearly perfectly elastic, it means that the quantity of investment demanded by firms is directly proportional to the interest rate. In this case, a central bank cannot lower interest rates to stimulate investment, as doing so would not increase the quantity of investment demanded. This would also limit the ability of the central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy.\n\nC. Banks make loans with all excess reserves.\n\nIf banks make loans with all excess reserves, it means that they do not hold any reserves in excess of what they need to meet their reserve requirements. In this case, a central bank cannot lower interest rates to stimulate lending, as doing so would not increase the amount of loans banks make. This would limit the ability of the central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy.\n\nD. Households carry very little cash holding their money in checking and saving deposits.\n\nIf households carry very little cash and hold most of their money in checking and saving deposits, it means that a central bank cannot lower interest rates to stimulate spending, as doing so would not increase the amount of cash households hold. This would limit the ability of the central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy.\n\nHowever, the most limiting factor would be A. Money demand is nearly perfectly elastic, as it directly prevents the central bank from conducting expansionary monetary policy by lowering interest rates.",
