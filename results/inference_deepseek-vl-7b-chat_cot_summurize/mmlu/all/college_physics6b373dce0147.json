            "content": "The time required for one revolution of a satellite in a circular orbit around a planet is given by the formula:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt(m/mu)\n\nwhere T is the time required for one revolution, m is the mass of the satellite, mu is the gravitational parameter (gravitational force between the satellite and the planet divided by the mass of the satellite), and 2\u03c0 is a constant representing the circumference of the orbit.\n\nThe gravitational parameter, mu, is proportional to the mass of the planet (M) and the mass of the satellite (m), but inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the orbit (R^2). Therefore, the time required for one revolution is not directly proportional to either m or R, but is inversely proportional to R^2.\n\nHowever, if we consider the time required for one revolution as a function of the mass of the planet (M), it is not a linear function. The time required for one revolution increases as the mass of the planet increases, but the rate of increase is not constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The time required for one revolution is proportional to R^(3/2).",
