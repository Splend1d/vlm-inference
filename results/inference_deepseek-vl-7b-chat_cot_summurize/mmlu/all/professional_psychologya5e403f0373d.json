Testifying in a divorce proceeding could potentially breach these boundaries and create a conflict of interest. Additionally, the psychologist may not have enough information about the other involved parties to provide an unbiased opinion. It is best to decline the request to testify in order to maintain the integrity of the therapeutic relationship and the psychologist's professional ethics.",
