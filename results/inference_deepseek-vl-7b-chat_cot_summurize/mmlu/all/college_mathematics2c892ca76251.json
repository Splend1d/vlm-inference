We are given that S3 = S2 + 14.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of subsets of X with 4 elements. Since each element in X can either be in a subset or not, there are 2^n subsets of X, where n is the number of elements in X. In this case, n = 4, so there are 2^4 = 16 subsets of X with 4 elements.\n\nHowever, we are asked for the number of subsets of X with exactly 4 elements, which means we need to exclude the subsets that contain 3 elements. Since S3 = S2 + 14, we can subtract 14 from the total number of subsets with 4 elements to get the number of subsets with exactly 4 elements:\n\n16 - 14 = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 subsets of X with exactly 4 elements. The correct answer is not listed in the given options, so we can assume that the problem statement is incorrect or there is an error in the given options.",
