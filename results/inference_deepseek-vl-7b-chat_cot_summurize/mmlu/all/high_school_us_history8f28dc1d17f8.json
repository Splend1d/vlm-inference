During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nWhich of the following best expresses the perspective of Logan in the passage above?\n\nA.

            "content": "The passage above is an address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, in 1774. The passage describes Logan's perspective on the conflict between his people and the white settlers, his advocacy for peace, and his pursuit of revenge for the murder of his family by Colonel Cresap.\n\nOption A suggests that Logan believes the expansion of British settlements must be stopped. However, the passage does not provide any explicit information to support this claim. Logan does mention that he advocated for peace during the last long and bloody war, but this does not necessarily mean he opposes the expansion of British settlements.\n\nOption B suggests that Logan laments the loss of his family. While Logan does express his grief over the murder of his family by Colonel Cresap, this is not the main focus of his address. He also does not specifically lament the loss of his family.\n\nOption C suggests that Logan opposes a new peace treaty. The passage does not provide any explicit information to support this claim. Logan does express his love for the whites and his advocacy for peace, but this does not necessarily mean he opposes a new peace treaty.\n\nOption D suggests that Logan believes that Indians need to find strength in unity. This seems to be the most accurate representation of Logan's perspective in the passage. Logan expresses his love for the whites and his advocacy for peace, but he also mentions that he has killed many and fully glutted his vengeance. This suggests that he believes in the strength of his people and the importance of unity in pursuing their goals.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option D. Logan believes that Indians need to find strength in unity.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
