            "content": "A. After applying batch normalization, the layer\u2019s activations will follow a standard Gaussian distribution.\n\nBatch normalization is a technique used in neural networks to normalize the activations of a layer. This means that the output of the layer will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is the distribution of a standard Gaussian (normal) distribution. This helps to improve the training of the network by making the activations more consistent across different mini-batches.\n\nB. The bias parameter of affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward.\n\nThis statement is not entirely true. The bias parameter of an affine layer is not redundant when a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward. The bias term is still needed in the affine layer to adjust the output of the layer, and the batch normalization layer will not affect the bias term.\n\nC. The standard weight initialization must be changed when using Batch Normalization.\n\nThis statement is not entirely true. The standard weight initialization (e.g., Xavier or He initialization) can be used when using batch normalization. However, some studies have shown that using a different initialization scheme (e.g., Glorot initialization) can lead to better performance in some cases.\n\nD. Batch Normalization is equivalent to Layer Normalization for convolutional neural networks.\n\nThis statement is not entirely true. While both batch normalization and layer normalization can be used in convolutional neural networks, they are not equivalent. Batch normalization is typically used in fully connected layers, while layer normalization is typically used in convolutional layers. Additionally, batch normalization applies to the entire mini-batch, while layer normalization applies to the activations of a single layer.",
