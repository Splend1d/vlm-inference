The expert's opinion is relevant to the issue of the company's negligence in failing to mark the submerged island, which is a key element of the plaintiff's case. The expert's opinion on the cost and feasibility of marking the island would provide evidence of the company's negligence in failing to do so. The other options are either irrelevant or go beyond the scope of the expert's qualifications.",
