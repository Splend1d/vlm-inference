On March 7, the woman sent the following purchase order to a manufacturer of widgets:\"Promptly ship 1,000 widgets, catalogue #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price to our warehouse. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \"This order was received by the manufacturer on March 9. The next day, the manufacturer replied by fax:\"Your order has been received. Shipment date will be March 12. Price $50 for each widget delivered. Be advised that these are the last widgets, under catalogue #B4-IEU, that we can deliver, since this variety is no longer being manufactured. \"Upon receipt of the fax, the woman immediately sent the following fax:\"Cancel our previous order for 1,000 widgets under catalogue #B4-IEU. Price too high. \"Assume $50 per widget was the current wholesale market price. Was an enforceable contract in effect between the woman and the manufacturer?\n\nA. No, because the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer, since it didn't contain a price term.\nB. No, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance.\nC. Yes, because the woman's order created a valid option contract.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer.\n",
