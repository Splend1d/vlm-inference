The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.\n\nWhen you double the number of experimental units for each treatment, the experiment becomes more powerful. This means that the probability of detecting a true effect (power) increases, while the probability of making a Type I error (false positive) remains the same. The probability of making a Type II error (false negative) decreases.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.",
