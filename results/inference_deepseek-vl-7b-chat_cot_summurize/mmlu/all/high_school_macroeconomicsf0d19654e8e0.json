Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase\n\nWhen a central bank engages in contractionary monetary policy, it means that the bank is trying to reduce the money supply in the economy. This can lead to an increase in interest rates, as banks will charge more for loans to discourage borrowing and spending.\n\nAt the same time, a contractionary monetary policy can also lead to a decrease in the demand for new homes, as people may be less likely to borrow money to buy a new home. This can result in a decrease in the price of new homes, as there is less demand for them.\n\nFinally, a contractionary monetary policy can also lead to an increase in the unemployment rate, as businesses may be less likely to hire new workers if they are worried about the future of the economy. This can result in more people being unemployed, which can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate.",
