Therefore, the polynomial is already in the form of a polynomial with coefficients in the field.\n\nThe polynomial x^2 + 1 in Z_2 can be rewritten as (x + 1)(x + 1) in the polynomial form.\n\nNow, let's find all the zeros of the polynomial (x + 1)(x + 1) in Z_2.\n\nThe polynomial (x + 1)(x + 1) can be factored as (x + 1)^2 in Z_2.\n\nIn Z_2, the only element that is equal to 1 is 1. Therefore, the only possible value for x in the polynomial (x + 1)^2 is 0.\n\nSo, the zeros of the polynomial x^2 + 1 in Z_2 are 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0,1.",
