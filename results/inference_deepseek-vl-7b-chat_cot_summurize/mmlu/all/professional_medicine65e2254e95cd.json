A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL (N<4). One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis. Which of the following is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test?\n\nA. Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population\nB. Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen\nC. Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population\nD. Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL\n",

This information can be obtained from the biopsy results.\n\nOption D provides this information: \"Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL\". This is the necessary information to calculate the sensitivity of the test.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
