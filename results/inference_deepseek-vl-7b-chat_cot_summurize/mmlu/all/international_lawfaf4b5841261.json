            "content": "Functional (ratione materiae) immunity refers to a legal concept in which a person or entity is immune from being sued or held liable for certain actions or omissions, based on the nature of the matter involved. This type of immunity is based on the principle that certain activities or situations are inherently beyond the control or responsibility of the person or entity involved, and therefore should not be subject to legal liability.\n\nIn the context of the options provided, the closest answer to functional immunity would be option B: \"Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act.\" This is because functional immunity is concerned with the nature of the act or situation, rather than the person or entity involved in it.\n\nIt's important to note that functional immunity is not a blanket immunity, but rather a specific type of immunity that applies to certain situations or acts. It is also not a substitute for other forms of immunity, such as absolute or qualified immunity, which may also be available in certain circumstances.",
