            "content": "Statement 1: The set of all rectangles in the 2D plane (which includes non axisaligned rectangles) can shatter a set of 5 points.\n\nThis statement is false. The concept of \"shattering\" refers to the ability of a set of points to be separated by a certain number of hyperplanes. In the case of rectangles, it is not possible to shatter a set of 5 points with a single rectangle. This is because a rectangle can only separate points that lie on the same side of the rectangle, and there are only 4 such points for a 2D rectangle. Therefore, it is not possible to shatter 5 points with a single rectangle.\n\nStatement 2: The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nThis statement is true. The VC-dimension of a classifier is a measure of its capacity to shatter a set of points. In the case of the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier, when k = 1, the classifier simply returns the label of the nearest neighbour. This means that the classifier can shatter any set of points by simply returning the label of the nearest neighbour, regardless of the position of the other points. Therefore, the VC-dimension of the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
