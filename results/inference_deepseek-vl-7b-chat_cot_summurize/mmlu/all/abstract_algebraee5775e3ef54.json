A permutation is a function that maps every element in a set to a unique element in another set. Since each element in the input set maps to a unique element in the output set, a permutation is a one-to-one function.\n\nStatement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one. This statement is false. While it is true that if a function is one-to-one, it is a permutation, the converse is not necessarily true. A permutation is a specific type of function, but not all functions are permutations. For example, a function that is not one-to-one, such as a function that multiplies all input values by a constant, is not a permutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
