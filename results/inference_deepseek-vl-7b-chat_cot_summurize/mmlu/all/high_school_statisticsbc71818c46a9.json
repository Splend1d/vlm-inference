            "content": "To find the expected gain or loss per game, we need to calculate the probability of each outcome and then multiply it by the corresponding winnings or losses.\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each outcome:\n\n1. Both dice show a 6: There are 2 * 1 = 2 ways to get a 6 on both dice.\n2. One die shows a 6 and the other shows a number other than 6: There are 6 * 5 = 30 ways to get a 6 on one die and a number other than 6 on the other die.\n\nSo, there are a total of 2 + 30 = 32 favorable outcomes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected gain or loss per game:\n\n1. Both dice show a 6: The player wins $20.\n2. One die shows a 6 and the other shows a number other than 6: The player loses $2.\n\nSo, the expected gain or loss per game is (2 * $20) + (30 * -$2) = $40 - $60 = -$20.\n\nHowever, this result is negative, which means the player would lose money in the long run. This is because the probability of winning is less than the probability of losing.\n\nTo find the expected gain or loss per game, we need to take the absolute value of the result:\n\n|-$20| = $20.\n\nSo, the expected gain or loss per game is $20.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The player will gain about $1.44.",
