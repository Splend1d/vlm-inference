In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\"\nJohn L. O'Sullivan, \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" 1839\nWhich of the following best states the principle described above?\n\nA. Colonists were destined to leave the British Empire because of the distance between the New World and England.\nB. Women are biologically predestined to lives of child rearing and domestic labor.\nC.

This principle is not about colonists leaving the British Empire, women's biological roles, or the inevitability of America's expansion to the West Coast. It is also not about the abolition of slavery, which was a result of moral and social changes, not divine destiny.\n\nTherefore, the principle described in the passage is best stated by option C: America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
