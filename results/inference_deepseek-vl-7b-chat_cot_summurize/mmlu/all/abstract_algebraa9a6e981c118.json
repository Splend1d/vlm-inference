We can do this by plugging in each possible value of x in Z_7 and checking if the polynomial equals zero.\n\n1. x = 0: (0)^3 + 2(0) + 2 = 2 (not a zero)\n2. x = 1: (1)^3 + 2(1) + 2 = 7 (not a zero)\n3. x = 2: (2)^3 + 2(2) + 2 = 15 (not a zero)\n4. x = 3: (3)^3 + 2(3) + 2 = 31 (not a zero)\n5. x = 4: (4)^3 + 2(4) + 2 = 67 (not a zero)\n6. x = 6: (6)^3 + 2(6) + 2 = 201 (not a zero)\n\nSo, the polynomial x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7 has no zeros.
