            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for energy dissipation in a resistor, which is given by:\n\nE = IV\n\nwhere E is the energy dissipation, I is the current, and V is the voltage.\n\nFirst, we need to find the current when the voltage is doubled. We can use Ohm's Law, which states that V = IR. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nI = V/R\n\nwhere R is the resistance.\n\nNow, when the voltage is doubled, the new voltage is 2V. Plugging this into the current equation, we get:\n\nI = (2V)/R\n\nSince the energy dissipation is given as 1 W, we can write the equation as:\n\n1 W = (2V)/R\n\nNow, we need to find the new energy dissipation when the voltage is doubled. We can use the formula for energy dissipation in a resistor:\n\nE = IV\n\nPlugging in the new voltage and current, we get:\n\nE = (2V) * (I)\n\nE = (2V) * ((2V)/R)\n\nE = 4V^2/R\n\nNow, we can compare this new energy dissipation to the given energy dissipation of 1 W:\n\n4V^2/R = 1 W\n\nTo find the new energy dissipation, we need to solve for R:\n\nR = (1 W) * (4V^2) / (4V^2)\n\nR = 1 W\n\nNow, we can find the new energy dissipation when the voltage is doubled:\n\nE = IV\n\nE = (2V) * (1 W)\n\nE = 2 W\n\nSo, the new rate of energy dissipation when the voltage is doubled is 2 W. The correct answer is not in the given options, but it can be calculated using the provided information.",
