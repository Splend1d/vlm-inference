The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be\n\nA. that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.\nB. that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.\nC. that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.\nD. that the mistake made the contract unconscionable.\n",

The other options do not apply in this situation:\n\nA. The homeowner was not aware of the mistake because the bid was sent by telegram, which is not something the homeowner could control.\nB. The telegraph company is not an independent contractor, they are a separate service provider and the painter should have been aware of the mistake.\nC. The homeowner did not have an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids, as the painter should have been aware of the mistake in the bid.",
