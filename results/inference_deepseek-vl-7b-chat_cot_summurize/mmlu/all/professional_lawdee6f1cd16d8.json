            "content": "An illegal alien and her three children live in a U. S. city. The city council has enacted an ordinance requiring illegal aliens to pay a $100 \"school fee\" for each child enrolled in a city public school. Citizens and legal aliens are not required to pay the school fee. The city council has enacted this law to raise funds to hire additional teachers who are bilingual. The city determined that over 15% of children attending public schools in the city were illegal aliens. Furthermore, the city conducted a study and found that the overwhelming majority of illegal aliens residing in the city did not pay any local property taxes. As a result, since the city provided educational benefits to the children of illegal aliens, the school fee furthered a significant governmental interest. The illegal alien, who is indigent, is unable to pay the city school fee. The city will not allow her children to attend school unless the fee is paid. If she seeks your legal advice regarding the constitutionality of the fee, you should advise her that the ordinance is\n\nA. valid, because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.\nB. valid, because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nC. invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\nD. invalid, because the cost of educating the children imposed an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers.\n",

This is a compelling governmental interest because it aims to improve education by providing bilingual teachers. The school fee is a reasonable way to fund this interest, as it affects only those who benefit from the educational services provided by the city.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. This option is too vague and does not provide a clear reason why the ordinance is valid.\nC. This option is incorrect because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not the same as denying them the right to pay a fee for the services they receive.\nD. This option is incorrect because the cost of educating the children is not an undue burden on the public school system. The city council has determined that over 15% of children attending public schools in the city were illegal aliens, and the school fee is a reasonable way to fund the additional bilingual teachers they need.",
