The maximum displacement of the resultant wave is equal to the larger of the two original amplitudes, while the minimum displacement is equal to the smaller of the two original amplitudes. In this case, the larger amplitude is 6 cm, so the maximum displacement is 6 cm, and the minimum displacement is 4 cm. Therefore, the displacement of the resultant wave will be between 4 cm and 6 cm, which is A. 2 cm \u2264 D \u2264 10 cm.",
