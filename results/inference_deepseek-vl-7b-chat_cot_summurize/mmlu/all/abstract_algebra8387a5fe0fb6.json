This means that the order of the elements does not matter.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. g = g^-1 for every g in G\nThis is a property of an element being its own inverse. If G is abelian, then every element in G is its own inverse, but the converse is not necessarily true. So, this statement is true for G if G is abelian.\n\nB. g = g^2 for every g in G\nThis is a property of an element being its own square. If G is abelian, then every element in G is its own square, but the converse is not necessarily true. So, this statement is true for G if G is abelian.\n\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\nThis is a property of the group operation being associative. If G is abelian, then this statement is true for G.\n\nD. G is of finite order\nThis statement is not necessarily true for G if G is abelian. A group is said to be of finite order if the order of every element in the group is finite. If G is abelian, then every element in G is its own inverse, which means the order of every element in G is 1, not finite.\n\nSo, the statements A and B are true for G if G is abelian, and C is also true for G if G is abelian. However, statement D is not necessarily true for G if G is abelian. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{A, B, C}}$",
