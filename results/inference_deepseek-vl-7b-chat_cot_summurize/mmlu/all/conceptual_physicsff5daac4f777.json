            "content": "The correct answer is D. None of these.\n\nThe force exerted by the rope is 25 N, and the crate is lifted by 100 N. The mechanical advantage of the pulley system is the ratio of the forces exerted by the rope to the weight of the crate, which is 25 N / 100 N = 1/4. This means that for every 1-m length of rope pulled down, the crate rises 1/4 m.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the rise of the crate in centimeters, not meters. To convert 1/4 m to centimeters, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25 cm.\n\nSo, for every 1-m length of rope pulled down, the crate rises 25 cm. Therefore, the answer is D. None of these.",
