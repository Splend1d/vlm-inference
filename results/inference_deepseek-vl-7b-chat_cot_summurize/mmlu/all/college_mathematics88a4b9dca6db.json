If A and C are connected, it means that there is no separation between them. If A is connected, it means that it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Similarly, if C is connected, it means that it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Since B is a proper subset of both A and C, it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Therefore, B must be connected.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\n\nThis statement is also true. Compactness is a topological property that means that every open cover of a set has a finite subcover. If A and C are compact, it means that every open cover of A and C has a finite subcover. Since B is a proper subset of both A and C, it must also have a finite subcover of its open cover. Therefore, B is compact.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\n\nThis statement is also true. A topological space is Hausdorff (also known as T2) if for any two distinct points x and y in the space, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x \u2208 U and y \u2208 V. If A and C are Hausdorff, it means that for any two distinct points a and c in A and C, there exist disjoint open sets U and V in A and C such that a \u2208 U and c \u2208 V. Since B is a proper subset of both A and C, it must also have disjoint open sets in its topology. Therefore, B is Hausdorff.",
