The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. The court will most likely construe restriction (23) as a (an)\n\nA. negative easement.\nB. equitable servitude.\nC. affirmative covenant.\nD. fee simple absolute.\n",

            "content": "The restriction in the general plan, which prohibits the construction of any house or structure on the strip of land running through the blocks, can be construed as an (23) affirmative covenant. This is because it imposes a positive obligation on the subsequent owners of the lots to refrain from building on that particular strip of land. \n\nAn easement is a right that one person has to use another person's land for a specific purpose, such as access to a public utility company. A servitude is a similar right, but it is imposed on the land of the servient estate (the land being used) rather than the dominant estate (the land imposing the right). A fee simple absolute is the highest form of ownership, where the owner has full and exclusive possession and control of the property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (23) C. affirmative covenant.",
