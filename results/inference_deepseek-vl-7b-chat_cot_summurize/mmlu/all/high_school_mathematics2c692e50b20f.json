            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFirst, we need to find the time it takes for Jennifer to run the first half of the race. The distance of the first half is 26.2 miles / 2 = 13.1 miles. The speed is 8 mph.\n\nTime = 13.1 miles / 8 mph = 1.6375 hours\n\nNext, we need to find the time it takes for Jennifer to run the second half of the race. The distance of the second half is also 26.2 miles / 2 = 13.1 miles. The speed is 6 mph.\n\nTime = 13.1 miles / 6 mph = 2.1833 hours\n\nNow, we can find the total time it takes for Jennifer to complete the race by adding the time for the first half and the time for the second half.\n\nTotal Time = 1.6375 hours + 2.1833 hours = 3.8208 hours\n\nRounding to the nearest hour, the total time is approximately 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 4.12.",
