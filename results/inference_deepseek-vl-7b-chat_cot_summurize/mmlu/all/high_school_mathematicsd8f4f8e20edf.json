Let's check each option:\n\nA. 392: The prime factors of 392 are 2 and 19. Since 2^2 = 4 and 19^2 = 361, both 4 and 361 are factors of 392. Therefore, 392 is a powerful number.\n\nB. 336: The prime factors of 336 are 2, 2, 2, and 3. None of the square of these prime factors are factors of 336. Therefore, 336 is not a powerful number.\n\nC. 300: The prime factors of 300 are 2, 2, 3, 5, and 11. None of the square of these prime factors are factors of 300. Therefore, 300 is not a powerful number.\n\nD. 297: The prime factors of 297 are 3 and 33. Since 3^2 = 9 and 33^2 = 1089, neither 9 nor 1089 are factors of 297. Therefore, 297 is not a powerful number.\n\nSo, the only number that is a powerful number among the given options is 392.",
