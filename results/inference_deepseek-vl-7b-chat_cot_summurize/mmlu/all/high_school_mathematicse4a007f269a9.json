The perfect squares in this range are 100, 121, 144, 169, 196.\n\nNext, we need to find the primes that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. The primes that meet this condition are 101, 103, 107, 109, 145, 147, 151, 157, 167, 181, 193.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of these primes. The sum of the primes is 101 + 103 + 107 + 109 + 145 + 147 + 151 + 157 + 167 + 181 + 193 = 1998.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the primes between 100 and 200, inclusive, that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square is 1998.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 298.",
