By definition, a free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements with no relations between them. For every positive integer rank, there exists a free abelian group of that rank. For example, the free abelian group of rank 1 is the set of integers, and the free abelian group of rank 2 is the set of pairs of integers.\n\nStatement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\nThis statement is false. The Betti number is a topological invariant that measures the \"holes\" in a space, while the number of elements in a generating set is a purely algebraic quantity. While it is true that a finitely generated abelian group is free if and only if its Betti numbers are all zero, the converse is not true. There exist finitely generated abelian groups that are not free, such as the direct product of two free groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, True.",
