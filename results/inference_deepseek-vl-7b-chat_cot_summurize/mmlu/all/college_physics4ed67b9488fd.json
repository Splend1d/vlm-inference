We want to find the frequency of the next higher harmonic, so n = 2.\n\nFrequency (f) = (2 * 131 Hz) / (2 * pi)\n\nFrequency (f) = 262 Hz / (2 * pi)\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of pi as 3.14159:\n\nFrequency (f) \u2248 262 Hz / (2 * 3.14159)\n\nFrequency (f) \u2248 262 Hz / 6.28318\n\nFrequency (f) \u2248 42.359 Hz\n\nThe next higher harmonic for the organ pipe has a frequency of approximately 42.359 Hz. However, this is not one of the given options. The closest option is B. 196 Hz, which is not the correct answer.",
