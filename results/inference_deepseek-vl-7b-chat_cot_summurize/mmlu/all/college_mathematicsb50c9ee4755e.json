The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\n\nd = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nIn this case, the curve xy = 8 is a circle with radius 8. The center of the circle is at the origin (0, 0). So, the coordinates of the curve are (8, 8).\n\nd = sqrt((0 - 8)^2 + (0 - 8)^2)\nd = sqrt(64 + 64)\nd = sqrt(128)\n\nThe shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin is 16.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 16",
