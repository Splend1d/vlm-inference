Plug x = 0 into the derivative:\n\ndy/dx = 1 + e^0 = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is 1.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlug in the slope (m = 1) and the point (x1 = 0, y1 = 0):\n\ny - 0 = 1(x - 0)\n\ny = x\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = x.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. y = x + 1",
