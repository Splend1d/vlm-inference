Fallacy of Composition\n\nThe statement \"Each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons\" is an example of the Fallacy of Composition. This fallacy occurs when one assumes that what is true for the parts (individuals) must also be true for the whole (the aggregate of all persons). In this case, Mill is assuming that because individual happiness is a good for each person, the general happiness (the aggregate of all persons) must also be a good. However, this is not necessarily true. The general happiness may not be a good for the aggregate of all persons, as it depends on the individual's subjective perception of happiness.",
