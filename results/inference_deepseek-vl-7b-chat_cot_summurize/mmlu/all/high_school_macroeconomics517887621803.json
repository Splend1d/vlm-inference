A decrease in taxes and a lower discount rate: This policy would likely increase consumer spending and investment, as individuals would have more disposable income and businesses would have lower borrowing costs. This could potentially lead to an increase in real GDP.\n\nB. An increase in government spending and an increase in taxes: This policy would likely increase government spending, which could stimulate the economy, but it would also increase taxes, which could reduce consumer spending and investment. The net effect on real GDP would depend on the balance between the two effects.\n\nC. A decrease in taxes and selling bonds in an open market operation: This policy would likely increase consumer spending and investment, as individuals would have more disposable income and businesses would have lower borrowing costs. However, selling bonds in an open market operation would likely increase the money supply, which could lead to inflation.\n\nD. An increase in government spending and an increase in the discount rate: This policy would likely increase government spending, which could stimulate the economy, but it would also increase the discount rate, which could reduce consumer spending and investment. The net effect on real GDP would depend on the balance between the two effects.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most likely combination of policies that would have brought the economy to this point is A.
