Female students who attend half-time are still permitted a $100 tax exemption, whereas male students who attend half-time are no longer permitted any tax exemption. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the correct rule of constitutional law regarding the state tax exemption for students who enroll half-time?\n\nA. The tax exemption would be invalidated as a denial of due process.\nB. The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause.\nC. The tax measure would be upheld as within the area of substantive due process.\nD. The tax measure would be upheld as within the power of a municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.\n",

            "content": "The correct rule of constitutional law regarding the state tax exemption for students who enroll half-time is most accurately summarized by option D. The tax measure would be upheld as within the power of a municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.\n\nThis is because the state is providing a tax exemption to full-time students and not providing one to half-time students, which is a differentiation based on the status of the students (full-time or half-time). This differentiation is within the power of the municipality (in this case, the state) to tax different classes of persons unequally.\n\nThe other options do not apply in this context:\n\nA. The tax exemption would be invalidated as a denial of due process. This would apply if the state was denying the tax exemption without a fair process, but in this case, the state is providing the exemption to full-time students and not to half-time students, which is a differentiation based on the status of the students, not a denial of due process.\n\nB. The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause. This would apply if the state was treating different classes of students unequally, but in this case, the state is treating full-time and half-time students differently, which is within the power of the municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.\n\nC. The tax measure would be upheld as within the area of substantive due process. This would apply if the state was providing the tax exemption as a substantive right, but in this case, the tax exemption is a policy decision, not a substantive right.",
