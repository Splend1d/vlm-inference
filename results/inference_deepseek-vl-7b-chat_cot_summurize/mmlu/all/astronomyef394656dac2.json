Since the gravity on the new planet is half of Earth's gravity, the weight on the new planet will be half of 50N.\n\nWeight on the new planet = 50N / 2 = 25N\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of the sand bag on the new planet. The mass of the sand bag is given as 5kg. Since mass is a scalar quantity and does not depend on the gravitational force, the mass of the sand bag will remain the same on the new planet.\n\nMass on the new planet = 5kg\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nMass 5kg weight 25N",
