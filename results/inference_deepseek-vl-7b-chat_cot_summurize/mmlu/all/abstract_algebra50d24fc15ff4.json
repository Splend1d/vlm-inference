If G and G' are two groups, there always exists a homomorphism from G to G' if the groups are not isomorphic.\n\nStatement 2: Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.\nThis statement is false. A homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation, but it does not have to be a one-to-one map. For example, consider the homomorphism from the group of integers modulo 4 to the group of integers modulo 3, which sends 0 to 0, 1 to 1, 2 to 2, and 3 to 1. This homomorphism is not one-to-one.",
