This means that the quantity demanded is relatively insensitive to changes in price.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A 5% price increase results in a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded.\nThis situation is an example of inelastic demand. The percentage change in quantity demanded (3%) is less than the percentage change in price (5%).\n\nB. A 4% price increase results in a 6% decrease in the quantity demanded.\nThis situation is not an example of inelastic demand. The percentage change in quantity demanded (6%) is greater than the percentage change in price (4%).\n\nC. A 4% price increase results in a 4% decrease in the quantity demanded.\nThis situation is not an example of inelastic demand. The percentage change in quantity demanded (4%) is equal to the percentage change in price (4%).\n\nD. A 3% price decrease results in a 5% increase in the quantity demanded.\nThis situation is not an example of inelastic demand. The percentage change in quantity demanded (5%) is greater than the percentage change in price (3%).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. A 5% price increase results in a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded.",
