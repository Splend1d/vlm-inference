This is because the maximum speed occurs when the block is at its maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, which is the amplitude. The acceleration due to gravity, which is a constant, is acting against the restoring force of the spring, so the maximum speed is proportional to the square root of the amplitude because the restoring force is proportional to the amplitude.",
