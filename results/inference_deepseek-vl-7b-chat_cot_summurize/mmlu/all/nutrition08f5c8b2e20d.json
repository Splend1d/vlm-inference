So, the digestible energy intake is:\n\n9279 kJ - 647 kJ - 318 kJ = 8304 kJ\n\nTherefore, the average daily digestible energy intake is 8304 kJ.\n\nTo calculate the average daily metabolisable energy intake, we subtract the energy content of faeces and urine from the gross energy intake. So, the metabolisable energy intake is:\n\n9279 kJ - 647 kJ - 318 kJ = 8304 kJ\n\nTherefore, the average daily metabolisable energy intake is 8304 kJ.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 647 kJ and 318 kJ",
