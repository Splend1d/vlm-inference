The origin is at (0, 0, 0).\n\nLet's find the distance from the origin to each point on the plane:\n\nA. (0, 0, 1):\nDistance = \u221a((0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2) = \u221a(1^2) = 1\n\nB. (3/7, 3/14, 9/14):\nDistance = \u221a((3/7 - 0)^2 + (3/14 - 0)^2 + (9/14 - 0)^2) = \u221a(9/49 + 9/49 + 81/196) = \u221a(9/16 + 9/16 + 81/16) = \u221a(181/16)\n\nC. (7/15, 8/15, 1/15):\nDistance = \u221a((7/15 - 0)^2 + (8/15 - 0)^2 + (1/15 - 0)^2) = \u221a(49/225 + 16/225 + 1/225) = \u221a(66/225)\n\nD. (5/6, 1/3, 1/3):\nDistance = \u221a((5/6 - 0)^2 + (1/3 - 0)^2 + (1/3 - 0)^2) = \u221a(25/36 + 1/36 + 1/36) = \u221a(41/36)\n\nThe point that is closest to the origin is the one with the smallest distance. Comparing the distances, we have:\n\n\u221a(181/16) < \u221a(66/225) < \u221a(41/36)\n\nSo, the point closest to the origin is:\n\nB. (3/7, 3/14, 9/14)",
