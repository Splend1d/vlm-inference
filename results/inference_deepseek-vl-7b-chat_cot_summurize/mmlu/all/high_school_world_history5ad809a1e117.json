            "content": "This question refers to the following information.\nWhether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?\n\nA. The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\nB. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\nC. They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.\nD. They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n",

            "content": "The tone of the first passage suggests that the British were motivated to eradicate the sati ritual primarily because they considered it inhumane and a cruel practice that was causing the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of innocent victims. They felt that they had the power to prevent this and that it was their responsibility to do so. They were not necessarily concerned with Christianizing the Hindu population, promoting women's equality, or expressing a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs. Therefore, the tone of the first passage best supports the supposition that the British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
