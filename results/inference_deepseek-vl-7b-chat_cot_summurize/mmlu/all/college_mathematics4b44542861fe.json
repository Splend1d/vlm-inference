            "content": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Even if V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, it does not mean that U = M(V). For example, consider the case where T is a 2x2 matrix and V is the space of 2x2 matrices. In this case, U = M(V) because all matrices in M(V) are in U. However, U is not equal to M(V) because there are matrices in M(V) that are not in U.\n\nII. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\nThis statement is true. By the definition of U and W, we have dim(U) = dim(M(V)) and dim(W) = dim(M(V)). Therefore, dim(U) + dim(W) = dim(M(V)). Since V has dimension n, we have dim(M(V)) = n^2.\n\nIII. dim (U) < n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. As mentioned in statement I, U = M(V) when V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T. In this case, dim(U) = dim(M(V)) = n^2. Therefore, dim(U) can be greater than n.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. II only.",
