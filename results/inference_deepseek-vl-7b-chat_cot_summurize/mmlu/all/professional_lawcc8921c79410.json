The woman knew that the $5 bill, which had President Lincoln's picture upside down, was worth $500 to bill collectors. The woman then asked the customer if he would like to exchange \"that old $5 bill for a new bill. \" The customer accepted the woman's offer and handed her the misprinted bill for a new one.
