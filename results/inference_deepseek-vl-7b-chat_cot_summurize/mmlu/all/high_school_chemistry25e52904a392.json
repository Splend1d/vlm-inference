            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use the equilibrium constant (Kp) and the partial pressure of SO3 (P(SO3)) to find the partial pressure of O2 (P(O2)).\n\nThe equilibrium constant (Kp) is given as 3.0 \u00d7 10^22. This value represents the equilibrium constant for the reaction:\n\nSO2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) \u21cc SO3(g)\n\nThe partial pressure of SO3 (P(SO3)) is given as 0.789 atm Hg. This value represents the partial pressure of SO3 at equilibrium.\n\nWe can use the following equation to find the partial pressure of O2 (P(O2)):\n\nP(O2) = Kp * P(SO3) / P(SO2)\n\nFirst, we need to find the partial pressure of SO2 (P(SO2)). We can use the fact that the total pressure of the system is the sum of the partial pressures of the reactants:\n\nP(total) = P(SO2) + P(O2) + P(SO3)\n\nSince the reaction is at equilibrium, the partial pressures of the reactants and products are equal:\n\nP(SO2) + P(O2) = P(SO3)\n\nNow, we can solve for P(SO2):\n\nP(SO2) = P(SO3) - P(O2)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for P(SO2) into the equation for P(O2):\n\nP(O2) = 3.0 \u00d7 10^22 * 0.789 atm Hg / (0.789 atm Hg - P(O2))\n\nWe are asked to find the expected partial pressure of O2, so we need to find the value of P(O2) when the reaction comes to equilibrium. Since the reaction is at equilibrium, the partial pressure of O2 will be equal to the partial pressure of SO3:\n\nP(O2) = 0.789 atm Hg\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation for P(O2):\n\n0.789 atm Hg = 3.0 \u00d7 10^22 * 0.789 atm Hg / (0.789 atm Hg - 0.789 atm Hg)\n\n0.789 atm Hg = 3.0 \u00d7 10^22 * 0.789 atm Hg\n\n0.789 atm Hg = 2.354 \u00d7 10^22 atm Hg\n\nNow, we can find the expected partial pressure of O2:\n\nP(O2) = 0.789 atm Hg / 2.354 \u00d7 10^22 atm Hg\n\nP(O2) = 0.0000333 atm Hg\n\nThe expected partial pressure of O2 is 0.0000333 atm Hg.\n\nHowever, the options provided are not in the same units as the partial pressure of O2. To convert the partial pressure of O2 to the same units as the options, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 atm Hg = 1.333 \u00d7 10^-5 torr\n\n0.0000333 atm Hg = 0.0000333 * 1.333 \u00d7 10^-5 torr\n\n0.0000333 atm Hg = 4.55 \u00d7 10^-6 torr\n\nThe expected partial pressure of O2 is 4.55 \u00d7 10^-6 torr.\n\nNone of the provided options match this value.
