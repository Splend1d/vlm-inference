However, there is currently no vaccine available for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Vaccines for herpes are being researched, but none have been approved for widespread use yet.\n\nA. Chemotherapy - This is not a correct answer, as chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer, not herpes infections.\n\nC. Hygiene and social distancing - While good hygiene and practicing social distancing can help to prevent the spread of herpes, they are not a direct method of controlling the infection itself.\n\nD. No method - This answer is also incorrect, as antiviral medications are available to help manage herpes infections.",
