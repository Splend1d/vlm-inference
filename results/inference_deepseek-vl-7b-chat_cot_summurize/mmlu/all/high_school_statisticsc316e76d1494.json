In this case, the power is 0.8, which means that there is an 80% chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. This means that there is a 20% chance of committing a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true). Therefore, the probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1, which corresponds to 20% or 0.2 in decimal form.\n\nB. If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2.\n\nThe probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis (H0) is also known as the probability of a Type II error. In this case, the power of the test is 0.8, which means that there is an 80% chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. This means that there is a 20% chance of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is true. Therefore, the probability of failing to reject H0 (Type II error) is 0.2, which corresponds to 20% or 0.2 in decimal form.\n\nC. The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.3.\n\nThe probability of committing a Type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false) is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the probability of committing a Type II error is 0.3.\n\nD. All of the above are valid conclusions.\n\nA and B are valid conclusions, as they are directly related to the power of the test and the probabilities of committing a Type I and Type II error, respectively. However, C is not a valid conclusion, as it is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, only A and B are valid conclusions.",
