The salesman wants to sell Zoey as many bricks as possible to cover her patio with a thickness of one brick, while not having any extra bricks. The patio area is a rectangle with dimensions 12 feet by 10 feet, and each individual brick is 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches. What would be the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell to meet his sales criteria?\n\nA. 5,760\nB. 2,880\nC. 2,160\nD. 1,440\n",

            "content": "To find the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell, we need to calculate the total area of the patio and divide it by the area of one brick.\n\nThe area of the patio is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 12 feet * 10 feet = 120 square feet.\n\nThe area of one brick is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height: 4 inches * 6 inches * 2 inches = 48 square inches.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of bricks needed to cover the patio: 120 square feet / 48 square inches = 2.5 bricks.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a brick, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell is 3 bricks.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices provided match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices.",
