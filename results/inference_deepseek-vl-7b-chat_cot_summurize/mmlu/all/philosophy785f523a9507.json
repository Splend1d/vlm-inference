It is not possible to determine whether the death of two people is always worse than the death of one, sometimes less bad, exactly as bad, or if the notion of the sum of two people's losses should be rejected based on the information provided.\n\nTo evaluate Taurek's claim, we would need more context or specific criteria for comparing the losses or impacts of the deaths of two people versus one person. Additionally, the claim about the sum of two people's losses would require a clear understanding of what is meant by \"losses\" and how they should be summed or compared.\n\nIn summary, without further information or context, it is not possible to accurately assess Taurek's claim.",
