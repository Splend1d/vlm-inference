We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.\nC. We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\nD. When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n",
