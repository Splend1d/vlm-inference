            "content": "The question presents a scenario where an amateur detective, without knowledge of the reward notice, investigates the murder of the man's brother and later leads to the arrest and conviction of the murderer. The detective then learns about the reward and demands the $10,000 from the man. The question asks whether the detective will succeed in his action to recover the reward.\n\nOption A suggests that the detective will succeed because his apprehension of the murderer created a contract implied in law. This is not necessarily true, as the contract would have to be based on an agreement or understanding between the parties, which was not present in this case.\n\nOption B suggests that the detective will succeed because he was unaware of the offer. This is not a valid argument, as the detective's lack of knowledge of the reward does not affect his right to the reward.\n\nOption C suggests that the detective will not succeed because he did not have knowledge of the reward. This is not a valid argument, as the detective's lack of knowledge of the reward does not affect his right to the reward.\n\nOption D suggests that the detective will not succeed because his investigation was not a bargained-for exchange. This is the most valid argument, as the detective's investigation was not a bargained-for exchange with the man, and therefore, the man is not obligated to pay the reward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The detective will not succeed in his action to recover the $10,000 reward because his investigation was not a bargained-for exchange.",
