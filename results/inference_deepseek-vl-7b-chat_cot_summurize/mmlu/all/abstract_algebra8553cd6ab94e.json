In the case of the ring Z_3 x Z_3, the identity element is (0, 0) and the zero element is (0, 0).\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. 0: If the characteristic is 0, then 0 times the identity element should be the zero element. However, 0 times (0, 0) is still (0, 0), which is not the zero element.\n\nB. 3: If the characteristic is 3, then 3 times the identity element should be the zero element. In this case, 3 times (0, 0) is (0, 0), which is the zero element.\n\nC. 12: If the characteristic is 12, then 12 times the identity element should be the zero element. However, 12 times (0, 0) is not the zero element.\n\nD. 30: If the characteristic is 30, then 30 times the identity element should be the zero element. However, 30 times (0, 0) is not the zero element.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x Z_3 is 3. The correct answer is B.",
