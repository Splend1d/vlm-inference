The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant forms a group under matrix multiplication. This is because the group axioms are satisfied:\n\n1. Closure: The product of any two 2 x 2 matrices is another 2 x 2 matrix.\n2. Associativity: The product of three 2 x 2 matrices is the same as the product of the three matrices in any order.\n3. Identity: The 2 x 2 identity matrix serves as the identity element under matrix multiplication.\n4. Inverse: For each 2 x 2 matrix, there exists an inverse matrix such that the product of the matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix.\n\nStatement 2: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nThis statement is false. The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is not a group under matrix multiplication. This is because the group axioms are not satisfied:\n\n1. Closure: The product of two 2 x 2 matrices with determinant 1 does not always result in another 2 x 2 matrix with determinant 1. For example, the product of the matrices (1, 0) and (0, 1) has determinant 1, but the product of the matrices (1, 1) and (1, 1) has determinant 1 as well, but it is not a 2 x 2 matrix.\n2. Associativity: The product of three 2 x 2 matrices with determinant 1 does not always result in the same matrix as the product of the three matrices in any order.\n3. Identity: The 2 x 2 identity matrix with determinant 1 serves as the identity element under matrix multiplication.\n4. Inverse: For each 2 x 2 matrix with determinant 1, there exists an inverse matrix such that the product of the matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
