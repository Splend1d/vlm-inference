            "content": "The central limit theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the behavior of sample means as the sample size increases. The theorem states that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\nI. The mean of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the mean of the population.\nThis statement is not entirely correct. According to the central limit theorem, the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (also known as the population mean) is equal to the population mean. However, the mean of the sampling distribution of a single observation (x\u0304) is not necessarily equal to the population mean.\n\nII. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the standard deviation of x-divided by the square root of the sample size.\nThis statement is also not entirely correct. According to the central limit theorem, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (also known as the standard error) is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIII. If the sample size is large, the shape of the sampling distribution of x-is approximately normal.\nThis statement is correct. The central limit theorem states that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed. This is because the sum of many independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the original distribution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
