According to the Sylow theorems, a group of order 42 is a p-group, where p is a prime number. In this case, p = 3, and the Sylow theorems state that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3^2 = 9. By the normalizer-centralizer theorem, the normalizer of a Sylow p-subgroup is also a Sylow p-subgroup. Therefore, the normalizer of a Sylow 3-subgroup is itself, and thus the normal subgroup of order 7 is a Sylow 3-subgroup.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\nThis statement is false. As mentioned in the previous response, a group of order 42 is a p-group, where p = 3. The Sylow theorems state that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. However, there is no Sylow 8-subgroup in a group of order 42, as 8 is not a divisor of 42. Therefore, there is no normal subgroup of order 8 in a group of order 42.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B.
