The diameter is given as 3 cm, so the radius is 1.5 cm. The perimeter (circumference) of a circle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\n\nPerimeter = 2 * \u03c0 * 1.5 cm \u2248 9.42 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the resistance per meter. The formula for resistance is:\n\nResistance = (Number of turns) / (Length of the solenoid)\n\nResistance = 1000 turns / 30 cm \u2248 33.33 ohms/meter\n\nNow, we can find the energy stored in the magnetic field:\n\nEnergy = (1000 turns) * (10 A) * (30 cm) * (9.42 cm) * (33.33 ohms/meter)\nEnergy \u2248 0.015 joule\n\nSo, the energy stored in the magnetic field of the solenoid is approximately 0.015 joule. The correct answer is A.",
