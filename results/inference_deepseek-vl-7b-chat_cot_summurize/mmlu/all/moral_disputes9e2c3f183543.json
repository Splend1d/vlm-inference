Mill believed that human desires and preferences are the ultimate source of value and that what is desirable is whatever satisfies these desires. He rejected the idea that desires could be determined by external authorities, such as experts or God, and argued that rational insight alone could not determine desirability. Instead, Mill emphasized the importance of empirical evidence, such as observing people's actual desires and preferences, in determining what is desirable.",
