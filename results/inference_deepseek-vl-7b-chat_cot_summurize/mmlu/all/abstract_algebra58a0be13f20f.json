If a is an element of G and aH is a subgroup of G, then a is in H by definition of a subgroup. Conversely, if a is in H, then aH is a subgroup of G.\n\nStatement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H. This statement is false. The equality aH = bH does not imply that ab is in H. It only implies that aH = bH, which means that the left cosets aH and bH are equal. However, this does not necessarily mean that ab is in H. For example, consider the groups Z2 and Z2. In Z2, the subgroups are {0} and {1}, and the elements are {0, 1}. The left cosets are {0}, {1}, and {0, 1}, but ab = 0 for all a, b in Z2. Therefore, ab is not in H for any a, b in Z2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
