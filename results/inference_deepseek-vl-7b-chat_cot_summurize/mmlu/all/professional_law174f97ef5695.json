            "content": "The bystander's prior statement, which contradicts the current testimony, could potentially impeach the bystander's credibility. However, it is not clear whether the trial judge should instruct the jury to disregard the prior statement entirely or only to consider it as evidence of the bystander's credibility. \n\nOption A, permitting the jury to consider the prior statement as substantive evidence, would allow the jury to consider the bystander's prior statement as evidence of the defendant's guilt. This could potentially lead to an unfair trial, as the jury might be influenced by the bystander's prior statement rather than the evidence presented in the trial.\n\nOption B, permitting the defendant to call other witnesses to confirm the fact that the prior statement had been made, could potentially help to corroborate the bystander's testimony. However, this option does not directly address the issue of whether the prior statement should be considered as substantive evidence or only as evidence of the bystander's credibility.\n\nOption C, on request by the defendant, instructing the jury that the bystander's testimony that the defendant had driven through the red light bedisregarded, would directly address the issue of whether the prior statement should be considered as substantive evidence or only as evidence of the bystander's credibility. This option would allow the jury to disregard the prior statement entirely, which could potentially lead to an unfair trial, as the jury might be influenced by the bystander's prior statement rather than the evidence presented in the trial.\n\nOption D, on request by the plaintiff, instructing the jury that the prior statement may be used only to impeach the bystander's credibility, and not as substantive evidence, would allow the jury to consider the prior statement as evidence of the bystander's credibility, but not as evidence of the defendant's guilt. This option would not directly address the issue of whether the prior statement should be considered as substantive evidence or only as evidence of the bystander's credibility.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C. The trial judge should instruct the jury that the prior statement may be used only to impeach the bystander's credibility, and not as substantive evidence. This would allow the jury to disregard the prior statement entirely, which could potentially lead to an unfair trial, as the jury might be influenced by the bystander's prior statement rather than the evidence presented in the trial.",
