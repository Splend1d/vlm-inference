A splitting field is a field that contains all the roots of a polynomial with coefficients in another field. If R is a field, then it is a splitting field for any polynomial with coefficients in R. The rational numbers Q are a field, so any polynomial with coefficients in Q will have a splitting field over R.\n\nStatement 2: There is a field with 60 elements.\nThis statement is false. The smallest field is the rational numbers Q, which has only 2 elements. A field with 60 elements would be a much larger field, and there is no known field with 60 elements.",
