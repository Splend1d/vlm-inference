            "content": "A first-year law student worked as a part-time law clerk at a prestigious law firm. He was permitted to borrow law books and legal treatises to take home for his own personal use. One afternoon, the law student was preparing a brief in the firm's law library when he noticed a book lying on the conference table. Making sure no one was watching him, he took the book and placed it in his briefcase. He planned to take the book home that night with the intention of not returning it. If the law student is subsequently charged with larceny of the book, which of the following claims, if true, would LEAST aid him in his defense?\n\nA. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\nB. He intended to return the book after reading it.\nC. The law firm had given him possession of the book.\nD. The law firm had given him custody of the book.\n",

            "content": "The law student's defense would be that he did not steal the book, but rather borrowed it with the intention of returning it. Therefore, the claim that would least aid him in his defense is that the law firm had given him possession of the book. If the law firm had given him possession, it would imply that he had the right to take the book, which contradicts his defense that he borrowed it with the intention of returning it.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
