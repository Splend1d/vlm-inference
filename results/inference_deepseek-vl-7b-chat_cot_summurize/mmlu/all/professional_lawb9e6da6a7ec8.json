I'll pay you $275 if you will change the oil, replace the oil filter, and adjust the carburetors by February 10. \"The mechanic received the man's letter on February 3. That same day, he telephoned an auto supply company and ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work. Two days later, the mechanic met the man at a party and this conversation took place:The man: \"Disregard the letter I sent you last week. \"The mechanic: \"No way, man, I already ordered the materials on from the auto supply company. \"The man: \"Sorry, but I sold my car yesterday, so forget the repair work. \"If the mechanic initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties?\n\nA. The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.\nB. The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.\nC. Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.\nD. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n",

            "content": "The man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties is that the mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer. This is because, under the doctrine of consideration, a contract is not enforceable if one party has not fulfilled their part of the agreement before the other party revokes their offer. In this case, the man's offer was to pay the mechanic $275 for the specified services, and the mechanic had not yet begun performing these services when the man revoked his offer. Therefore, the man's argument that no contract was formed would be that the mechanic had not completed performance before the offer was revoked.\n\nThe other options do not directly address the man's argument. Option B is not relevant because the man's offer could be accepted by a return promise, and the man did revoke his offer. Option C is also not relevant because the man's offer could be accepted by letter, and the man did revoke his offer. Option D is not strong because the man revoked his offer before the mechanic had begun the requested acts of acceptance.",
