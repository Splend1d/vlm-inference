A partial-ordering relation is a relation that is reflexive and transitive, but not necessarily symmetric. Therefore, every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\n\nB. Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\n\nThis statement is false. The number of relations from a set of n elements to a set of m elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, m) = n! / (m!(n-m)!), where ! denotes the factorial function. In this case, n = 3 and m = 2, so the number of relations is C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3 / 2 = 1.5, not 64.\n\nC. Empty relation _ is reflexive.\n\nThis statement is true. The empty relation, denoted by an underscore (_), is reflexive because for any element x, x is related to itself (x, x) by the empty relation.\n\nD. Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\n\nThis statement is false. The properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are not negative of each other. Symmetry means that if an element x is related to an element y by the relation, then y is also related to x by the relation. Un-symmetry means that if an element x is related to an element y by the relation, then y is not related to x by the relation. These properties are distinct and not negative of each other.",
