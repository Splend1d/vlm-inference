            "content": "Wilshire Street is a public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Wilshire and Figueroa Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car. The businessman suffered damages in the amount of $5,000. The woman, on the other hand, suffered damages in the amount of $1,000. The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. \" Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.\nB. The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.\nC. The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.\nD. The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.\n",

            "content": "To determine the appropriate judgment in the case, we need to calculate the proportion of negligence attributable to each party and then apply the statute's provision for damages.\n\nThe statute states that damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. Since both drivers are negligent, we need to calculate the proportion of negligence attributable to each party.\n\n30% of the negligence is attributable to the woman, and 70% of the negligence is attributable to the businessman.\n\nNow, we need to apply the statute's provision for damages. The statute states that damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. Since the businessman is the injured party, his damages should be diminished by the proportion of negligence attributable to the woman.\n\nThe businessman's damages are $5,000, and the woman's negligence is 30% of the total negligence. Therefore, the businessman's damages should be reduced by 30% of $5,000, which is $1,500.\n\nThe businessman's new damages are $5,000 - $1,500 = $3,500.\n\nSince the woman's negligence is 30% of the total negligence, her damages should be reduced by 30% of $1,000, which is $300.\n\nThe woman's new damages are $1,000 - $300 = $700.\n\nNow, we can calculate the set-off of damages between the respective parties. The statute states that there shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate judgment in the case is:\n\nA. The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.",
