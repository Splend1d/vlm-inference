It is observed that a speaker frequency of 60 Hz does not produce standing waves in the string. Which explanation for this phenomenon is correct?\n\nA. The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\nB. The wave speed on the string is fixed.\nC. 60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound.\nD. The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz.\n",
