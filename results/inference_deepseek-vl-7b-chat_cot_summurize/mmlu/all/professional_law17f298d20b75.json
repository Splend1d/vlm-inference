The defendant was taken directly from the scene of the crime in a patrol car to the police station where he was placed, still handcuffed, in an interview room. He waited for about an hour, and a detective finally came in. The detective gave the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to sign the waiver and speak to the detective. The defendant then confessed to the robbery. Which of the following allegations would be LEAST helpful in suppressing his statement?\n\nA. Before the defendant gave the statement he was refused permission to use the bathroom.\nB. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\nC. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\nD. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\n",

            "content": "The defendant's statement would be least helpful in suppressing if the arrest was not based on probable cause. This is because the defendant's rights under Miranda v. Arizona are based on the premise that the person is in custody and being interrogated by the police. If the arrest was not based on probable cause, then the defendant's rights under Miranda may not have been violated.\n\nProbable cause is a legal standard that allows law enforcement to arrest a person without a warrant if there is a reasonable belief that the person has committed a crime. If the arrest was not based on probable cause, then the defendant's rights under Miranda may not have been violated.\n\nThe other allegations (A, B, and D) do not necessarily invalidate the defendant's statement. The refusal to use the bathroom before giving the statement (A) does not have a direct impact on the validity of the statement. Having a private lawyer on retainer (B) does not affect the validity of the statement, as the defendant's rights are protected by the police, not the lawyer. The fact that the warnings were given in English (D) does not invalidate the statement, as the defendant's rights are protected by the police, not the language of the warnings.\n\nTherefore, the allegation that would be LEAST helpful in suppressing the defendant's statement is that the arrest was not based on probable cause.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
