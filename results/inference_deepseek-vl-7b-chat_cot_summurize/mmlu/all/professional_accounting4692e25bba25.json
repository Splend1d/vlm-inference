            "content": "To calculate the NPV (Net Present Value) of the investment project, we can use the formula:\n\nNPV = (Expected Cash Flows / (1 + Discount Rate)^Time) - Initial Investment\n\nIn this case, the expected cash flows are $2 million in five years, the discount rate is 10%, and the initial investment is $1 million.\n\nNPV = ($2,000,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5) - $1,000,000\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discount factor:\n\n(1 + 0.10)^5 = 1.2105106\n\nNow, we can plug this into the formula:\n\nNPV = ($2,000,000 / 1.2105106) - $1,000,000\n\nNPV \u2248 $1,666,666.67 - $1,000,000\n\nNPV \u2248 $666,666.67\n\nSo, the NPV of the investment project is approximately $666,666.67. However, since the options are not in this format, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe closest whole number to $666,666.67 is $667,000. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $242,000",
