To find the number of elements in this group, we need to find the largest multiple of 25 that is less than or equal to 30.\n\n25 * 1 = 25\n25 * 2 = 50 (which is not less than or equal to 30)\n\nSo, the largest multiple of 25 that is less than or equal to 30 is 25. Therefore, the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25 has 1 element.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 25",
