            "content": "To find the work done on a particle of mass m to accelerate it to a speed of 0.6c, we can use the formula:\n\nW = (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere W is the work done, m is the mass of the particle, v is the final velocity, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nIn this case, the final velocity v is 0.6c. Since the speed of light is constant, we can use the fact that 1c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nSo, v = 0.6c = 0.6 * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s = 1.8 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nW = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2) * m * (1.8 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nW = (1/2) * m * (1.8 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nW = (1/2) * m * (3.24 x 10^16 m^2/s^2)\n\nW = (1/2) * m * 3.24 x 10^16 m^2/s^2\n\nW = 0.612 m^2/s^2\n\nNow, we can convert this to joules (the unit of work) by multiplying by 10^18:\n\nW = 0.612 * 10^18 J\n\nW \u2248 6.12 x 10^17 J\n\nSo, the work done on a particle of mass m to accelerate it to a speed of 0.6c is approximately 6.12 x 10^17 joules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1.25mc^2",
