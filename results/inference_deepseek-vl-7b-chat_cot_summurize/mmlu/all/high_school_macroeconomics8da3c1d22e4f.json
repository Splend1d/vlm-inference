Real income is the income adjusted for inflation, which is represented by the CPI.\n\nLet's denote the initial real income as R0 and the initial nominal income as N0. The initial CPI is 100.\n\nThe nominal income increases by 8 percent, so the new nominal income is N1 = N0 * (1 + 0.08).\n\nThe CPI increases by 2 percent, so the new CPI is 100 * (1 + 0.02).\n\nNow, we can calculate the new real income, R1, using the formula:\n\nR1 = N1 / (CPI * (1 + (N1 - R0) / N0))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 * (1 + (N0 * (1 + 0.08) - R0) / N0))\n\nR1 = (N0 * (1 + 0.08)) / (100 *",
