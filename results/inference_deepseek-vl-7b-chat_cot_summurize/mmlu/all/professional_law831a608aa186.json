            "content": "An inventor developed a prototype of an automobile. engine that she believed was going to revolutionize the automotive industry because of the engine's fuel-efficient properties. As a wedding present to the inventor's brother, the inventor wrote on a wedding card she gave to her brother:\"I hereby assign to you 20 percent of the net profits realized from the production and distribution of my automobile engine within the first year of production. \"The inventor then borrowed money from creditors and began to promote her automobile engine. She was contacted by a major automobile manufacturer about the possibility of using the engine in a new line of cars the manufacturer intended to release during the next calendar year. While on her way to meet with the representatives of the manufacturer, the inventor was killed in an automobile collision. The manufacturer then contracted with the executor of the inventor's estate to license the use of the automobile engine design for a 10-year period for $500,000, payable to the estate. The creditors from whom the inventor borrowed the money to promote her automobile engine have now attached the proceeds from the licensing agreement, which have so far been paid into the estate. The brother also asserts his assigned rights to a share of the proceeds. In subsequent actions by the creditors and the brother, the court will most probably hold in favor of\n\nA. the brother, because the rights of an assignee are superior to a lien against the assignor subsequently obtained by legallequitable proceedings.\nB. the brother, because any proceeds of the assigned right received by the assignor thereafter are held in constructive trust for the assignee.\nC. the creditors, because the inventor's assignment to the brother was unenforceable as a defective assignment.\nD. the creditors, because the rights of creditors/lienors are superior to those of a donee beneficiary.\n",

This assignment was made before the creditors were paid, and therefore, the creditors' liens on the proceeds of the assignment are junior to the brother's rights as an assignee. The court is likely to hold that the brother's rights as an assignee are superior to the creditors' liens, as the rights of an assignee are generally superior to a lien against the assignor that is subsequently obtained by lawful proceedings.",
