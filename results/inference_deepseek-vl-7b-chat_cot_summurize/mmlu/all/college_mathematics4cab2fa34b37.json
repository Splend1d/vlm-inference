            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 courses and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it, we can think of this as distributing 2 identical items (professors) into 20 distinct boxes (courses).\n\nThe number of ways to distribute the professors among the courses is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (professors) and k is the number of items to be distributed (courses).\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (professors) and k = 20 (courses). So, we have:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/(2)\n\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 different ways to assign the professors to the courses.\n\nNow, we need to consider that each professor can be assigned to any course, so we need to multiply the number of ways to assign each professor by the number of ways to assign the remaining professors.\n\nSince there are 10 professors, there are 10! ways to assign them to the courses. However, since each professor can be assigned to any course, we need to divide by the number of ways to assign each professor, which is 20! (since each professor can be assigned to any of the 20 courses).\n\nSo, the total number of different assignments is:\n\n45 * 20! / 20!\n\n45 * 20! / 20! = 45\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 10!/2^9.",
