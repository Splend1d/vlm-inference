            "content": "To calculate the total flight time of the soccer ball, we need to find the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height and then fall back to the ground.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum height the ball can reach. The maximum height (h) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nh = \u221a(2 * g * L)\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2) and L is the initial launch angle (30\u00b0).\n\nh = \u221a(2 * 9.81 * 30)\nh \u2248 15.7 m\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height. We can use the following formula:\n\nt = 2 * h / v\n\nwhere t is the time, h is the height, and v is the initial velocity.\n\nt = 2 * 15.7 / 10\nt \u2248 3.14 s\n\nSince the ball reaches its maximum height in 3.14 seconds, the total flight time is the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height and fall back to the ground:\n\nTotal flight time = 3.14 s + 3.14 s\nTotal flight time \u2248 6.28 s\n\nHowever, this total flight time includes the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height and the time it takes for the ball to fall back to the ground. Since air resistance is negligible, the ball will continue to fall back to the ground at the same speed it was kicked. Therefore, the total flight time should be the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height:\n\nTotal flight time = 3.14 s\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1 s",
