However, it's important to note that the question is somewhat vague and could be interpreted in different ways.\n\nOne interpretation could be the difference in the approval of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which aimed to desegregate schools. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 1964, 60% of Americans supported the Civil Rights Act, and the breakdown by region is not explicitly provided. However, it's known that the South had a lower approval rate than the rest of the country.\n\nAnother interpretation could be the difference in the approval of school desegregation policies, which would require more specific data.\n\nWithout more context or specific data, it's difficult to provide an accurate answer. If you have more information or a specific time period in mind, please provide it so I can give a more accurate response.",
