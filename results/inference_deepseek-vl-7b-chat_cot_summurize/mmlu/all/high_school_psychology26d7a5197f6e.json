Achievement tests are designed to measure a person's knowledge or skills in a specific subject area. They are often used to evaluate a student's progress in a particular subject over time.\n\nThe AP Psychology examination is designed to assess a student's knowledge of the subject matter covered in the course. It is not designed to measure a student's aptitude (ability to learn) or intelligence (general cognitive ability), nor is it designed to be projective (measuring unconscious thoughts or feelings).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. achievement",
