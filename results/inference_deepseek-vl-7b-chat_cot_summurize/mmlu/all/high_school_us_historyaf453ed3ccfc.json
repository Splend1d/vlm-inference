The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance. Should its influence become concentrated, as it may under the operation of such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation. But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it cannot be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence.\"\nPresident Andrew Jackson, Veto of the Bank of the United States, 1832\nWhich of the following events most directly caused the formation of the Second Bank of the United States?\n\nA. The failure of the Specie Circular\nB. Unregulated currency and federal debts after the War of 1812\nC. Efforts by Alexander Hamilton to stabilize the national economy\nD. Federalist counter-reaction to the extreme budget-cutting under Jefferson\n",
