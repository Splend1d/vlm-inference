This means that the codon on the mRNA will have the same base as the anticodon on the tRNA. The anticodon on the tRNA is complementary to the codon on the mRNA.\n\nIn this case, the codon on the mRNA is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032. The anticodon on the tRNA will have the same base at the first position (the 5\u2032 end) and the third position (the 3\u2032 end) to match the mRNA codon. Therefore, the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032.",
