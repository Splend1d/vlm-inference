            "content": "Statement 1: f : X \u2192 Y is continuous and X is compact. f must be uniformly continuous.\n\nThis statement is true. According to the definition of continuity, a function is continuous if it maps each open set in the domain to an open set in the codomain. Compactness, on the other hand, is a property of topological spaces, where every open cover has a finite subcover. Uniform continuity is a stronger property that requires the function to be continuous on every closed interval. Since f is continuous and X is compact, f must be uniformly continuous.\n\nStatement 2: If f(x), g(x) : R \u2192 R are everywhere differentiable, f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable.\n\nThis statement is false. The differentiability of a function is not preserved under composition. If f and g are differentiable functions, then f(x) and g(x) are differentiable functions, but f(g(x)) is not necessarily differentiable. The derivative of f(g(x)) is the derivative of f evaluated at g(x), which may not exist if g(x) is not differentiable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, False.",
