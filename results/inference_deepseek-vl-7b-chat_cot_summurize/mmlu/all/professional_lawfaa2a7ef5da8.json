The property consisted of a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. During her occupancy, the boss paid $3,500 each year in insurance and property taxes. In addition, the premises on the property had a fair market value during this period of $1,500 each year. Following her mother's death, the boss's daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. As the administratrix of the boss's estate, the daughter sought to collect from the co-worker one- half of the cost of insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. Conversely, the co-worker claimed that he was not liable for any of the expenses. Furthermore, the coworker's attorney advised him that the daughter did not own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, he (the co-worker) owned the entire property. The attorney also informed the co-worker that the daughter owed him rent for the entire period of her occupancy, and if she continued to occupy the premises, then she would be liable for insurance and property taxes as well. In an appropriate action to determine the title of the property, what, if any, interest does the daughter have in the said property?\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.\nB. An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\nC. An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\nD. An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.\n",

            "content": "The correct answer is A. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.\n\nThe co-worker and the boss were both tenants in common, meaning they owned the property equally. When the boss died, her share of the property passed to her daughter as her heir. However, since the co-worker owned the entire property by right of survivorship (meaning that if the boss died, her share would pass to him), the daughter does not have any interest in the property.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. An undivided one-half interest: This would be correct if the co-worker and the boss were tenants by the entirety, meaning they owned the property as a single unit. However, they were tenants in common, so this answer is incorrect.\n\nC. An undivided one-half interest: This answer is similar to option B and is also incorrect.\n\nD. An undivided whole interest: This answer is incorrect because the co-worker already owned the entire property by right of survivorship, so the daughter does not have any interest in it.",
