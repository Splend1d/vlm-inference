The function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) is already in the form of y = f(x), where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable.\n\nThe boundary curve is the graph of y = f(x). To find the equation of the boundary curve, we need to solve the equation f(x) = 0 for x.\n\n0 = x/(1 + x^3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 + x^3), we get:\n\n0 = x\n\nThis means that the boundary curve is a vertical line at x = 0. The region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) is a right triangle with base 0 and height 1.\n\nThe volume of a right triangle is given by the formula V = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, the base is 0 and the height is 1.\n\nV = (1/2) * 0 * 1 = 0\n\nSo, the volume of the solid generated is 0.
