Individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years, and thus are not able to reproduce and pass on the gene. What would explain how this allele and its associated disease is preserved in the population?\n\nA. Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.\nB. Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form.\nC. Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual.\nD. Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive.\n",
