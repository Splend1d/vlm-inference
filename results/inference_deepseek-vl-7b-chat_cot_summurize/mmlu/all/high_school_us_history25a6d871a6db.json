They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment\u2026.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of following Amendments to the Constitution is most directly an example of the sentiments expressed above?\n\nA. The First Amendment, which guaranteed the right to free speech\nB. The Tenth Amendment, which allows powers not granted to the federal government be granted to the states\nC. The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed all women the right to vote\nD. The Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol\n",

This sentiment is most directly exemplified by the Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed all women the right to vote. This amendment was a significant step forward in the fight for women's rights and reflects the evolving societal understanding of gender equality. The other options, while important, do not as directly illustrate the need for institutions to adapt to changing times and understanding.",
