This means that the debugger is intercepting the memory access at this address. The text segment of P begins at 0x77E80000 in P\u2019s virtual address space and the debugger has mapped this same text segment at 0x01000000 in its virtual address space.\n\nThe debugger has mapped the virtual memory page containing this address with READ/WRITE access. This is because the debugger is not only reading from this memory location (as indicated by the breakpoint), but also writing to it (as indicated by the load instruction). Therefore, the virtual address used by the debugger in its WRITE operation is 0x01001234, and the page is mapped with READ/WRITE access.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0x01001234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access",
