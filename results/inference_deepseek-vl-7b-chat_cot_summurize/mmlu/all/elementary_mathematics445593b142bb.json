We know that B + P + G = 30 (total number of soccer balls) and B = P = G (equal number of blue, pink, and green balls).\n\nFrom the given information, we can write the following equations:\n\nB + P + G = 30\nB = P = G\n\nSince B = P = G, we can substitute B with G in the first equation:\n\nG + G + G = 30\n3G = 30\n\nNow, we can solve for G:\n\nG = 30 / 3\nG = 10\n\nSo, Coach Wu has 10 green soccer balls.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 10.",
