The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Which of the following best describes the cause of the large percent difference?\n\nA. The ball changes its shape while falling.\nB. The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.\nC. Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball.\nD. The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity.\n",
