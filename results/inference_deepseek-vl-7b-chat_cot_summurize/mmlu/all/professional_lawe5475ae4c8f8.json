The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nA unilateral contract is a contract that is formed when one party makes an offer that the other party is under no obligation to accept. In this case, the homeowner made an offer to replace the roof, and the roofer agreed to do the work if he could clear his schedule. This is a unilateral contract because the homeowner is not obligated to pay the roofer if he cannot clear his schedule.\n\nHowever, once the roofer began unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house, he manifested an intent to accept the offer. This means that he was taking steps to perform the work, and it would be reasonable for the homeowner to assume that he intended to complete the job. Therefore, the homeowner would be obligated to pay the roofer for the work he had already done.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. A bilateral contract is formed when both parties agree to the terms of the contract. In this case, the homeowner made an offer, but the roofer did not agree to the terms until he began unloading the materials and equipment.\n\nB.
