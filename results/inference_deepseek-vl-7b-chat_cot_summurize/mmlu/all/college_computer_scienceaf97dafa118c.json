It is a sound proof system in the sense that there does not exist a proof of the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula of propositional logic. This is true. The Resolution theorem proving system is sound, meaning that if a formula is unsatisfiable, then there is no proof of its unsatisfiability.\n\nII. It is a complete proof system in the sense that there is a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsa tisfiable formula of propositional logic. This is not true. The Resolution theorem proving system is not complete, meaning that there are unsatisfiable formulas for which it cannot prove their unsatisfiability.\n\nIII. It is a succinct proof system in the sense that whenever an unsatisfiable formula F of propositional logic has a resolution proof, F also has a proof whose length is polynomial in the length of F. This is not true. The Resolution theorem proving system is not succinct, meaning that there are unsatisfiable formulas for which it cannot provide a proof whose length is polynomial in the length of the formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
