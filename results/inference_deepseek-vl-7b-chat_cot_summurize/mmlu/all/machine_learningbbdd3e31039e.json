GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are commonly used for training neural networks due to their parallel processing capabilities, which can significantly speed up the training process.\n\nStatement 2: True, True\n\nExplanation: The ResNet-50 model indeed has over 1 billion parameters. ResNet (Residual Network) is a type of convolutional neural network architecture that uses skip connections, also known as \"shortcuts,\" to improve the training process and reduce the risk of vanishing gradients. The ResNet-50 model is a variant of the ResNet architecture that uses a depth of 50 layers.",
