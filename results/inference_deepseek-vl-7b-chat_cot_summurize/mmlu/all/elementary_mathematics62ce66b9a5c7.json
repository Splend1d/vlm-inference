The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\nThis statement is true. The 4 in the tenths place represents 1/10 of the 4 in the tens place, which is 40.\n\nB. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nThis statement is not true. The 4 in the hundredths place represents 1/10 of the 4 in the ones place, which is 40.\n\nC. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nThis statement is not true. The 4 in the hundreds place represents 10 times the value of the 4 in the ones place, which is 40.\n\nD. The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\nThis statement is not true. The 4 in the tenths place represents 1/10 of the 4 in the hundredths place, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is option A. The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
