            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of income Carson would have reported if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much income Carson would have received as an S corporation shareholder. Since the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed $70,000 in cash dividends, the remaining $330,000 ($400,000 - $70,000) would be distributed as non-cash items.\n\nNext, let's find out how much of the non-cash items would be distributed to Carson. Since Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock, he would receive 40% of the non-cash items.\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of income Carson would have received as an S corporation shareholder:\n\n$330,000 (total non-cash items) * 0.40 (Carson's share) = $132,000\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total income Carson would have reported as an S corporation shareholder:\n\n$132,000 (income from non-cash items) + $28,000 (income from cash dividends) = $160,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $160,000.",
