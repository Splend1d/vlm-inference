Tamika's increased perception that she is happy is best explained by applying which of the following theories?\n\nA. relative deprivation\nB. adaptation-level\nC.

            "content": "A. relative deprivation\n\nRelative deprivation is a psychological theory that suggests people feel unhappy or discontent when they perceive that they are not getting their fair share of resources or opportunities compared to others. In this case, Tamika initially felt deprived because she had little compared to others. After volunteering and seeing others in a worse situation, she felt grateful for what she had and her happiness increased. This aligns with the relative deprivation theory.\n\nB. adaptation-level is not the correct answer because it refers to the tendency of people to adjust their preferences and satisfaction levels to their current environment. This does not explain Tamika's increased happiness.\n\nC. Yerkes-Dodson arousal is a theory about the relationship between anxiety and performance, not happiness. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n\nD. diathesis-stress is a theory in psychology that describes the relationship between a person's predisposition (diathesis) to a particular condition and the stressor that triggers the condition. It does not explain Tamika's increased happiness.",
