The exam is normed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 9. Only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation. Estrella received a 90 on the test. What was her percentile rank on the test, and did she qualify for further evaluation?\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n",

            "content": "To find Estrella's percentile rank, we need to find the value that corresponds to her score on the test. We can do this by finding the z-score corresponding to her score and then finding the percentile rank.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the score, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, X = 90, \u03bc = 80, and \u03c3 = 9.\n\nz = (90 - 80) / 9\nz = 10 / 9\nz \u2248 1.11\n\nNow, we need to find the percentile rank corresponding to this z-score. We can use a z-table or an online calculator to find the percentile rank.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the z-score of 1.11 corresponds to a percentile rank of approximately 86.65%.\n\nSince this percentile rank is greater than 15%, Estrella qualifies for further evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 86.65; she qualified.",
