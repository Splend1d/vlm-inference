The land was subject to a $10,000 mortgage that the partnership assumed. In addition, the partnership had $20,000 in recourse liabilities that would be shared by partners according to their partnership interests. What amount represents Skinner\u2019s basis in the partnership interest?\n\nA. $27,000\nB. $21,000\nC. $19,000\nD. $13,000\n",

            "content": "To calculate Skinner's basis in the partnership interest, we need to consider the value of the cash and land he contributed and the mortgage assumed by the partnership.\n\nSkinner's cash contribution of $5,000 is not subject to any adjustment, so its basis is $5,000.\n\nThe land's basis is the cost basis plus any adjustments. The cost basis is the $12,000 basis, and the partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage on the land. Therefore, the adjusted basis is $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000.\n\nNow, we need to consider the fair market value of the land. The fair market value is $20,000.\n\nTo calculate Skinner's basis in the partnership interest, we need to add the cash contribution and the adjusted basis of the land:\n\nBasis = Cash Contribution + Adjusted Basis of Land\nBasis = $5,000 + $2,000\nBasis = $7,000\n\nTherefore, Skinner's basis in the partnership interest is $7,000. The correct answer is not listed in the options provided, so we cannot choose from the given choices.",
