            "content": "A woman broke her leg while skiing. She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective. The woman was forced to have a second surgery to replace the defective screws. If the woman asserts a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nB. prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.\nC. not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.\nD. not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.\n",

Under strict tort liability, a plaintiff can recover damages without proving fault or negligence on the part of the defendant. The woman's claim will most likely prevail because the screws were defective and unreasonably dangerous, and the doctor and the hospital provided them to her as a product. The fact that the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws does not absolve them of liability, as they are still responsible for the quality of the products they use in their medical practice.",
