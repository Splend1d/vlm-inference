            "content": "To find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a field, we need to check the conditions for a quotient ring to be a field.\n\nA field is a commutative ring with unity, i.e., for all a, b in the ring, ab = ba. In our case, we are working with the ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1).\n\n1. Commutativity: Since Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a quotient ring, it is not commutative. So, c cannot be 0.\n\n2. Unity: The ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) does not have unity, as the polynomial x^3 + cx^2 + 1 does not have a root in Z_3. So, c cannot be 1.\n\n3. Inverses: For a polynomial to have an inverse, it must have a root in Z_3. The polynomial x^3 + cx^2 + 1 does not have a root in Z_3, as Z_3 does not contain any elements that can be factored into x^3 + cx^2 + 1. So, c cannot be 2.\n\nTherefore, the only value of c in Z_3 that satisfies the conditions for Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1 to be a field is c = 0.\n\nSo, the answer is A.",
