            "content": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was a significant agreement between the kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, Portugal, and the Algarves. The treaty aimed to resolve a dispute over the lands discovered in the ocean sea up to that point. The dispute was primarily about the rights to the lands discovered by Portuguese explorers, who were looking for a route to Asia.\n\nThe treaty established a demarcation line, drawn north and south from pole to pole on the ocean sea, from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole. This line was to be three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. The lands discovered by the Portuguese on the eastern side of this line, in either north or south latitude, would belong to the Portuguese and their successors.\n\nThe reason the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line is not explicitly stated in the passage provided. However, we can infer that the Portuguese were interested in controlling the lands they had discovered, particularly those in the east, as they were valuable and potentially rich in resources. The Portuguese were also looking for a route to Asia, and the lands they had discovered in the east could potentially lead them to this route.\n\nTherefore, the best inference that explains the reason the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line is that the Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico, as this was a significant and valuable territory that they had discovered and were interested in controlling.\n\nSo, the answer is C. The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico.",
