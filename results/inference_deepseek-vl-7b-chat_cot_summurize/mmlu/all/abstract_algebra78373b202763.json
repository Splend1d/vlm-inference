The given statement says that for all a \\in A, g(f(a)) = a. This means that the function g is mapping the output of the function f back to the input, which is a characteristic of injective functions. Therefore, the function g must necessarily be injective.\n\nStatement 2: The function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\nSurjective functions, also known as onto functions, are functions where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. The given statement says that for all b \\in B, g(f(b)) = b. This means that the function g is mapping the output of the function f back to the input, which is a characteristic of surjective functions. However, this statement alone does not necessarily imply that the function g is surjective, as it only states that for every element in the codomain, there is an element in the domain that maps to it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.
