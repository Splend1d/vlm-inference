            "content": "To find the probability of both marbles being the same color, we need to find the probability of each color and then add them together.\n\nThe probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is 4/10 (since there are 4 red marbles out of a total of 10 marbles).\n\nAfter selecting a red marble, there are 3 red marbles left out of 9 marbles (since one was already selected). So, the probability of selecting a red marble on the second draw is 3/9.\n\nThe probability of selecting a blue marble on the first draw is 6/10 (since there are 6 blue marbles out of a total of 10 marbles).\n\nAfter selecting a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles left out of 9 marbles (since one was already selected). So, the probability of selecting a blue marble on the second draw is 5/9.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of both marbles being the same color by multiplying the probabilities of each color:\n\nProbability = (Probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw) * (Probability of selecting a red marble on the second draw) + (Probability of selecting a blue marble on the first draw) * (Probability of selecting a blue marble on the second draw)\n\nProbability = (4/10) * (3/9) + (6/10) * (5/9)\n\nProbability = (12/90) + (30/90)\n\nProbability = 42/90\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 7/15\n\nSo, the probability of both marbles being the same color is 7/15, which corresponds to option D.",
