That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

The implementation of joint-stock companies. \n\nThe passage mentions that Western Europe achieved global hegemony by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside its lands. It also mentions that this was accomplished through brutality and geographical and ecological luck. However, it does not mention the role of joint-stock companies in this process. \n\nThe other options are all mentioned in the passage as contributing to Western European global hegemony. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe (A) is mentioned as a result of the Columbian Exchange, which was a major factor in the rise of Western Europe. The refinement of gunpowder technologies (B) and the development and application of steam-powered technologies (C) are both mentioned as part of the scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions that supported the post-quantum-leap world.",
