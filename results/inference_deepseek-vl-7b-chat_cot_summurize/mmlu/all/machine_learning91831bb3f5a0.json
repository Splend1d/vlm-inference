This is because adding more hidden states allows the model to capture more complex patterns in the data, which can improve the likelihood.\n\nThe second statement is false because while collaborative filtering can be a useful model for modeling users' movie preference, it is not the only model. Other models like content-based filtering, matrix factorization, and hybrid filtering can also be used for this purpose.",
