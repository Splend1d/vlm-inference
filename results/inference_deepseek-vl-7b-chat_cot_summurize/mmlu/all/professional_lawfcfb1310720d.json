The defendant eventually stumbled into the bathroom where he spotted a purse lying on the floor under the sink. Wondering vaguely if it might contain more beer, he opened it up and found his friend's wallet. He grabbed some money from the wallet and left the bathroom. As he was descending the stairs with the money in his hand, his friend spotted him. She was initially concerned he might tumble down the stairs but upon seeing the money in his hand, she asked him where he got it. The defendant responded, \"Ha! Your money or your life!\" Not taking him seriously, the friend let him pass by. It wasn't until later that she realized that the defendant had taken the money from her wallet. The defendant should be charged with which of the following crimes?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Larceny and burglary.\nC. Larceny and attempted extortion.\nD. Robbery and extortion.\n",

The act of taking the money and saying \"Ha! Your money or your life!\" can be considered an attempt to intimidate the friend into giving him the money back, which could be considered attempted extortion. However, the main crime here is larceny, as the defendant took the money without the friend's permission.",
