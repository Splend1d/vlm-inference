The z-score is calculated as the raw score divided by the standard deviation, and it represents how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean.\n\nFor the English exam:\nz-score = (150 - 125) / 20 = 2.5\n\nFor the math exam:\nz-score = (100 - 90) / 10 = 1\n\nFor the chemistry exam:\nz-score = (55 - 45) / 5 = 1\n\nFor the history exam:\nz-score = (30 - 30) / 5 = 0\n\nThe z-scores indicate that the young man's performance on the English exam was 2.5 standard deviations above the mean, which is the highest z-score among the four exams. Therefore, the young man's test performance was best on the English exam.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. English.",
