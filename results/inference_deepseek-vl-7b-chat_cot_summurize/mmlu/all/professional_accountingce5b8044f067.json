            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue from renting the limousine and then divide it by the initial investment to find the yield.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily revenue from renting the limousine:\n\nDaily revenue = Hourly rate * Number of hours per day\nDaily revenue = $245 * 2 = $490\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from renting the limousine for a year:\n\nTotal revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days in a year\nTotal revenue = $490 * 365 = $171,150\n\nNow, let's calculate the yield on the investment:\n\nYield = Total revenue / Initial investment\nYield = $171,150 / $98,000 = 1.75\n\nTo express the yield as a percentage, we can multiply it by 100:\n\nYield = 1.75 * 100 = 175%\n\nHowever, the options given are not in the same format. Therefore, we can round the yield to the nearest whole number:\n\nYield = 180%\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is 180%, which corresponds to option D.",
