At trial, the plaintiff was asked questions on direct examination about the days on which she had observed large amounts of dust in the air and how long the condition had lasted. She testified that she could not remember the specific times, but that she maintained a diary in which she had accurately recorded this information on a daily basis. When her attorney sought to refresh her recollection with her diary, she still could not remember. The plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the information in the diary admitted at trial. Is the information admissible?\n\nA. No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.\nB. No, unless it is offered by the defendant.\nC. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\nD. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.\n",

Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\n\nThe information in the diary is relevant to the plaintiff's claim of injuries caused by air pollution. The fact that she maintained a diary to accurately record this information on a daily basis suggests that the information is reliable and should be admissible at trial. The fact that she could not remember the specific times and durations when she observed large amounts of dust in the air does not necessarily disqualify the diary as evidence. The plaintiff's attorney may argue that the diary is still admissible to show the general pattern of the pollution and its impact on the plaintiff's health.",
