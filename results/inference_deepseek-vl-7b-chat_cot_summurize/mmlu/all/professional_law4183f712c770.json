Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n",
