By the Sylow theorems, a group of prime-power order p^n has a subgroup of order p^i for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. If the group is solvable, then it has a normal subgroup of order p^i for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. This implies that the group is of prime-power order.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\nThis statement is false. While it is true that many groups of prime-power order are solvable (such as p-groups), it is not true that every group of prime-power order is solvable. For example, the cyclic group of order 4 (Z_4) is a group of prime-power order (2^2), but it is not solvable because it has an element of order 2 and an element of order 4, and the only subgroups of order 2 and 4 are the trivial subgroup and the group itself.",
