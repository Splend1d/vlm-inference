            "content": "Let's denote the number of days it takes Kate to write a practice test as $k$ and the number of days it takes John to write a practice test as $j$.\n\nWe are given that when Kate starts, it takes them 10 days to complete the practice test. This means that Kate writes $k/10$ of the practice test in 1 day and John writes $j/10$ of the practice test in 1 day.\n\nWe are also given that when John starts, it takes them 10.5 days to complete the practice test. This means that Kate writes $k/10.5$ of the practice test in 1 day and John writes $j/10.5$ of the practice test in 1 day.\n\nSince Kate and John work on the practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$k/10 + j/10 = 10$\n\n$k/10.5 + j/10.5 = 10.5$\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n$k + j = 100$\n\n$k + j = 105$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n$j = 5$\n\nSubstituting this value of $j$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$k + 5 = 100$\n\n$k = 95$\n\nNow, we can find the total time it would take Kate and John to complete the practice test if they worked simultaneously:\n\n$k + j = 95 + 5 = 100$\n\nSo, it would take them 100 days to complete the practice test if they worked simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
