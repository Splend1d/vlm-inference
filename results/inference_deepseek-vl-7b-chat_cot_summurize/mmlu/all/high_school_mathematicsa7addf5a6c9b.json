This means that $u$ must be greater than $-1$ or less than $-1/2$. So, the possible values of $u$ are in the interval $(-1/2, -1)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition $-20u \\notin (-\\infty,-1)$. This means that $u$ must be greater than $-1/20$ or less than $-1/2$. So, the possible values of $u$ are in the interval $(-1/20, -1/2)$.\n\nTo find the interval that consists of all $u$ that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the intersection of the two intervals. The intersection of $(-1/2, -1)$ and $(-1/20, -1/2)$ is the interval $(-1/20, -1/2)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
