The set {1,2, ..., n-1} under multiplication modulo n forms a group. A group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called group axioms are satisfied:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in the set, the result of the operation a * b is also in the set.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in the set, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element e in the set such that for every element a in the set, the equation e * a = a * e = a holds.\n4. Inverse element: For every element a in the set, there exists an element b in the set such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nIn the case of the set {1,2, ..., n-1} under multiplication modulo n, the operation is well-defined and satisfies all the group axioms.\n\nStatement 2: There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1.\n\nThis statement is false. To find an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if we have three moduli p1, p2, and p3, and the remainders of the numbers a1, a2, and a3 when divided by p1, p2, and p3 are all 1, then there exists a unique integer x such that x \u2261 a1 (mod p1) and x \u2261 a2 (mod p2) and x \u2261 a3 (mod p3).\n\nIn this case, we have p1 = 100, p2 = 100, and a1 = 63, a2 = 1, and a3 = 1. However, there is no unique integer x such that x \u2261 63 (mod 100) and x \u2261 1 (mod 100) simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
