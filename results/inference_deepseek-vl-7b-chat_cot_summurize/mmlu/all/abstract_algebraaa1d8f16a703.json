An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. If R is an integral domain, then R[x] (the ring of polynomials with coefficients in R) is also an integral domain. This is because the product of any two non-zero polynomials with coefficients in R is non-zero.\n\nStatement 2: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x).\n\nThis statement is false. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. If f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then their product f(x)g(x) will have a degree that is at most the sum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x), but not necessarily equal to it. For example, if f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = x^3, then deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg(x^5) = 5, while deg(f(x)) + deg(g(x)) = deg(x^2) + deg(x^3) = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
