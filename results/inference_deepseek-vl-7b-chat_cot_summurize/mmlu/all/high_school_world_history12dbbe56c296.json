Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nThe succeeding Song dynasty differed from the Tang in that\n\nA. the Song abolished the Confucian civil service exams\nB. the Song sponsored Buddhism to the detriment of Taoism and Confucianism\nC. the Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy\nD. the Song dynasty was originally from outside of China\n",

The text is a quote from Du Fu's \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" which is a poem from the Tang dynasty, and it discusses the hardships faced by the soldiers during that time. The text does not provide any information about the succeeding Song dynasty or its differences from the Tang dynasty. Therefore, none of the options can be verified based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, if you are asked to choose the correct answer based on your knowledge, the best option would be C. the Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy. This is because the text does not provide any information about the Song dynasty's foreign policy, but it does mention that the Song dynasty was originally from outside of China, which is not a valid choice because the text does not provide any information about the Song dynasty's origins.",
