We can write the number as a product of these prime factors:\n\nNumber = 2 * 5 * 7 * 13 * 31\n\nNow, let's check each of the options:\n\nA. 4: 4 = 2 * 2, so it cannot be a factor of the number.\n\nB. 6: 6 = 2 * 3, so it cannot be a factor of the number.\n\nC. 10: 10 = 2 * 5, so it can be a factor of the number.\n\nD. 15: 15 = 3 * 5, so it can be a factor of the number.\n\nTherefore, the numbers 10 and 15 must be factors of the number.",
