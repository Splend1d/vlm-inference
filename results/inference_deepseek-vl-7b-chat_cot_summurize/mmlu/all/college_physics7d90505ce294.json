            "content": "To find the minimum thickness of the oil film, we can use Snell's law and the Brewster's angle.\n\nSnell's law states that:\nn1 * sin(\u03b81) = n2 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two media, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, we have:\nn1 = 1.6 (glass)\nn2 = 1.2 (oil)\n\u03b81 = \u03b82 (since the angle of incidence is near normal incidence)\n\nSo, we can rewrite Snell's law as:\nsin(\u03b81) = sin(\u03b81)\n\n\u03b81 = sin(\u03b81) / n1\n\nNow, we can use the Brewster's angle to find the minimum thickness of the oil film. Brewster's angle is the angle at which light is completely reflected off a dielectric material. In this case, the angle of reflection is 90 degrees.\n\nsin(\u03b81) = sin(90\u00b0)\n\n\u03b81 = 1\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the thickness of the oil film:\n\nh = n2 * sin(\u03b81)\n\nh = 1.2 * sin(1)\n\nh = 1.2 * 0.5\n\nh = 0.6 nm\n\nHowever, the thickness cannot be negative, so the minimum thickness of the oil film is 0.6 nm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 150 nm.",
