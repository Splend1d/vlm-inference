            "content": "A manufacturer of widgets sent a letter to an international widget retailer offering to sell ten truckloads of construction-quality widgets for $1,000 per truck. The retailer emailed a note back saying \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" No shipment was sent, but four months later when the market demand for widgets skyrocketed, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach claiming that the retailer suffered damages by not having received the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. Does the retailer have a legal right to collect damages under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\nB. No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.\nD. Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n",

Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\n\nThe retailer's email response to the manufacturer's offer can be considered an unequivocal acceptance of the offer. This means that both parties have agreed to the terms of the contract, which includes the delivery of ten truckloads of construction-quality widgets. Since there is a clear offer and acceptance, and both parties have indicated their intent to form a contract, the retailer has a legal right to collect damages if the manufacturer fails to deliver the widgets as agreed.",
