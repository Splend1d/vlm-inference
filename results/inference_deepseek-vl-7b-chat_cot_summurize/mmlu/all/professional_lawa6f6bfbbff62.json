The husband was present and denied the allegation. Police asked for permission to search the premises for drugs, which was consented to by the wife. The husband, however, refused to consent to the search. The police went ahead anyway and found drugs in the husband's belongings. After being arrested on drug charges, the husband filed a motion for suppression of the evidence based on lack of consent. What should be the likely decision of the trial court?\n\nA. The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\nB. The search was valid because the cases say that one occupant's consent to the search overrules the other occupant's refusal to consent.\nC. The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed \u0080\u0093 this created exigent circumstances for the search.\nD. The search was invalid because, even though consent was given, the police must first attempt to get a search warrant to enter a home.\n",

The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\n\nIn this case, the husband's refusal to consent to the search is a crucial factor. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. In the context of a domestic dispute, the husband's refusal to consent to the search is a strong indication that the search was not justified. The wife's consent alone is not enough to override the husband's refusal, as the husband is also a co-occupant of the premises and has a right to control the search of his property. Therefore, the search was invalid, and the evidence found should be suppressed.",
