Which single statement about this phenomenon, below, is actually correct?\n\n\nA. A \"flip-flop\" mechanism efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane\nB. Water flows into the gut from the mucosa, during digestion of starch and protein, in order to reduce luminal osmolality\nC. Water is mostly absorbed by movement between the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via tight junctions\nD. Dietary intake of water is always greater than water movement in the small intestine\n",
