            "content": "The height of an electric fence for a mature cattle and sheep field should be at least 60 inches (D). This height is sufficient to deter both mature cattle and sheep from attempting to cross the fence. \n\nFor cattle, the recommended height for an electric fence is 12-18 inches, while for sheep, it is 6-12 inches. However, for a field that includes both mature cattle and sheep, a higher fence is necessary to ensure that both species are kept within the boundaries. \n\nA 6-inch fence would be too short for cattle and could be easily jumped by sheep, while an 18-inch fence would be too high for sheep and could cause injury to cattle. A 40-inch fence would be too high for both cattle and sheep, making it difficult for them to graze and move around the field. Therefore, a 60-inch fence is the most appropriate height for an electric fence in a field that includes both mature cattle and sheep.",
