However, the method `max(int num1, int num2)` is supposed to return the larger of the two numbers.\n\nGiven the matrix `[2 1 4 8\n6 0 3 9\n5 7 7 6\n1 2 3 4]`, the largest integer in the first row is 8. The largest integer in the second row is 9. The largest integer in the third row is 7. The largest integer in the fourth row is 4.\n\nTherefore, `max(max(matrix[2]), max(matrix[3]))` will return `max(max(4), max(7))`, which is `max(7, 7)`. The larger of these two numbers is 7.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 7.",
