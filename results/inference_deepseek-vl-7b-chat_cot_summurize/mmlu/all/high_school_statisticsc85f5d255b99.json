We can use the standard deviation as a placeholder (\u03c3) and solve for it:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * \u03c3^2) / 0.08^2\n\u03c3^2 = n * (0.08^2) / (1.96^2)\n\nNow, we can solve for \u03c3:\n\n\u03c3^2 = (n * 0.00064) / 3.8416\n\u03c3 = sqrt((n * 0.00064) / 3.8416)\n\nSince we don't have the actual values for n, \u03c3, and E, we cannot determine the exact sample size. However, we can provide a range of possible sample sizes based on the given information:\n\nIf we assume a standard deviation of 0.05 (which is a common assumption for a sample size of 100), we can calculate the sample size:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 0.05^2) / 0.08^2\nn \u2248 106\n\nIf we assume a standard deviation of 0.1 (which is a common assumption for a sample size of 1000), we can calculate the sample size:\n\nn = (1.96^2 * 0.1^2) / 0.08^2\nn \u2248 423\n\nSo, the student organization should sample at least 106 students to get a 90 percent confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08, and at most 423 students.",
