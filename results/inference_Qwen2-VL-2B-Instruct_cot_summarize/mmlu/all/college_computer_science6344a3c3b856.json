For example, \\( p_1 \\lor p_2 \\lor p_3 \\lor p_4 \\).\n\n2. **Condition II: Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.**\n   - This can be represented by a Boolean formula that includes the disjunction of exactly three variables. For example, \\( p_1 \\lor p_2 \\lor p_3 \\).\n\n3. **Condition III: An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.**\n   - This can be represented by a Boolean formula that includes the disjunction of an even number of variables.
