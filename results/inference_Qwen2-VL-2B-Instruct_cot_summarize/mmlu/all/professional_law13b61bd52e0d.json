The retailer emailed a note back saying \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" No shipment was sent, but four months later when the market demand for widgets skyrocketed, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach claiming that the retailer suffered damages by not having received the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. Does the retailer have a legal right to collect damages under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\nB. No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.\nD. Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the retailer has a legal right to collect damages under these facts, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in contract law and the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**: The manufacturer sent a letter offering to sell ten truckloads of construction-quality widgets for $1,000 per truck. The retailer accepted this offer by emailing back \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" This acceptance is clear and unequivocal, indicating an intent to form a contract.\n\n2. **Date of Delivery**: The retailer never called back and asked for the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. This lack of communication does not invalidate the contract. The retailer's failure to request the shipment does not affect the validity of the contract.\n\n3. **Avoidable Consequences Doctrine**: The doctrine of avoidable consequences is not relevant here because the retailer never requested the shipment. The retailer's failure to request the shipment does not create an avoidable consequence that would entitle the retailer to damages.\n\nGiven these points, the retailer does not have a legal right to collect damages under these facts. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized."
