Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nWhich of the following presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments?\n\nA. Franklin D. Roosevelt\nB. Lyndon B. Johnson\nC. Ronald Reagan\nD. Barack Obama\n"

                    "text": "To determine which president would be most likely to share Calvin Coolidge's sentiments, let's analyze the context and core of Coolidge's statement:\n\n1. **Core of Coolidge's Sentiments**: Coolidge emphasizes the importance of the right to enjoy one's own industry's rewards and the need for a government to protect liberty by not imposing taxes on the people without urgent necessity and sound public policy.\n\n2. **Context**: The passage discusses the necessity of economic security and the importance of the people's ability to enjoy their property without unreasonable taxation.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **A. Franklin D. Roosevelt**: Known for his New Deal programs, including the Fair Deal, which aimed to protect workers and the middle class. Roosevelt's policies were more focused on economic recovery and social welfare, not on protecting individual rights.\n   - **B. Lyndon B. Johnson**: Known for his War on Poverty and civil rights initiatives, which aimed at social justice and equality. Johnson's policies were more focused on addressing social issues rather than protecting individual rights.\n   - **C. Ronald Reagan**: Known for his economic policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, which aimed at economic growth and reducing government intervention. Reagan's policies were more focused on economic freedom and individual rights.\n   - **D. Barack Obama**: Known for his economic policies, including the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aimed at economic stability and consumer protection. Obama's policies were more focused on social and economic justice rather than individual rights.\n\nGiven the context and the core of Coolidge's sentiments, the president most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments is:\n\n**C. Ronald Reagan**\n\nReagan's economic policies were more focused on economic freedom and individual rights, aligning closely with Coolidge's views on protecting liberty and not imposing unnecessary taxes on the people."
