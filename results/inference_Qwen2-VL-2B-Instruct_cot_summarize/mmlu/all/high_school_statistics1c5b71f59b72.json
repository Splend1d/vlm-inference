To construct a 95% confidence interval, the registrar needs to know the sample proportion of students with the correct address on record.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The confidence interval is constructed based on the sample data, not the true proportion. The confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true proportion if the sample is representative.\n\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The registrar is interested in the proportion of students with the correct address on record, not the percentage of students who have the correct address. The confidence interval is constructed to estimate this proportion, not to determine the percentage of students who have the correct address.\n\nC. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The confidence interval is constructed to estimate the proportion of students with the correct address on record, not to determine the proportion of students who have the correct address. The confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true proportion if the sample is representative.\n\nD. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\n- This statement is true. The registrar is interested in the proportion of students with the correct address on record, and the confidence interval is constructed to estimate this proportion. If the sample proportion is within the confidence interval, it indicates that the sample is representative of the population and the confidence interval is likely to contain the true proportion.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval."
