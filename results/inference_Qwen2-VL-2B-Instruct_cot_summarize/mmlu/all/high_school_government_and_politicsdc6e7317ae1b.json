This veto power was established in the Constitution in Article II, Section 3, Clause 2, which states:\n\n\"Each House shall be the law-making branch of the State.\"\n\nThis clause gives Congress the power to make laws, but it also gives the President the power to veto those laws. If Congress passes a law that the President does not like, the President can veto it, and Congress must then pass a new law that the President can then sign into law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
