This means Pat bounces the ball at a rate of 25 bounces per 30 seconds.\n\nTo find out how many bounces Pat will make in 150 seconds, we can set up a proportion based on the rate of bounces per second:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of bounces per second} = \\frac{\\text{Number of bounces in 30 seconds}}{\\text{Time in seconds}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of bounces per second} = \\frac{25 \\text{ bounces}}{30 \\text{ seconds}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of bounces per second} = \\frac{25}{30} \\text{ bounces per second} \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many bounces in 150 seconds, we multiply the rate of bounces per second by 150 seconds:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of bounces in 150 seconds} = \\text{Rate of bounces per second} \\times 150 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of bounces in 150 seconds} = \\frac{25}{30} \\times 150 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of bounces in 150 seconds} = \\frac{25 \\times 150}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of bounces in 150 seconds} = \\frac{3750}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of bounces in 150 seconds} = 125 \\]\n\nTherefore, Pat will bounce the ball approximately 125 times in 150 seconds. The correct answer is B. 125."
