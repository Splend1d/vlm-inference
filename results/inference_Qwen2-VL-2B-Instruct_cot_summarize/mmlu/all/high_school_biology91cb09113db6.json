If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?\n\nA. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\nB. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\nD.

In this case, the dialysis bag contains a 0.5 M solution, and the beaker contains a 0.6 M solution. \n\nIf the dialysis bag were placed into a beaker of distilled water, the concentration of solute in the beaker would be higher than in the dialysis bag. This would cause water to move from the dialysis bag into the beaker, as water is more soluble in distilled water than in the dialysis bag. \n\nTherefore, the expected result would be:\n\nB.
