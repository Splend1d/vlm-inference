This is generally considered a morally acceptable action, as it is a necessary part of training a horse and ensuring its safety.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is leaving a banana peel on the ground, which is clearly morally wrong. Leaving a banana peel can cause harm to others, especially children, who might trip on it and injure themselves. This is a clear violation of the principle of treating others with respect and consideration."
