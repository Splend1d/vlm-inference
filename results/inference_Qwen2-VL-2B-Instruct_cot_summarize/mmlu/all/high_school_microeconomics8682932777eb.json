A perfectly vertical supply curve.\n\nIn economics, a perfectly vertical supply curve indicates that there are no barriers to the supply of a good or service, meaning that the quantity supplied is directly proportional to the price. This is a characteristic of a perfectly competitive market, where there are no barriers to entry or exit, and the supply of a good is determined by the quantity of labor and capital available, which is fixed.\n\nTherefore, the situation where one person has the only original signed copy of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith would illustrate this situation best by showing a perfectly vertical supply curve."
