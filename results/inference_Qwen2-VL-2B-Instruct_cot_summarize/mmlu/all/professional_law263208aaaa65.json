The University considered a student a \"nonresident\" if the student's primary residence was outside the state at any time during the previous school year. Imma Grant transferred from Sunshine State University to Evergreen State in her junior year, and paid nonresident tuition. She filed a declaratory judgment action against the Evergreen Registrar to have her considered a resident and asked for no money damages. Fourteen groups filed amicus briefs in support of Imma, advocating a change in Evergreen's protectionist regulation. Now that she is a senior, and spent the previous year within Evergreen so she is thus now considered a resident student. The federal court should\n\nA. Dismiss the suit as moot.\nB. Dismiss the suit, because Imma lacked standing to sue initially.\nC. Hear the case if it appears that Ms. Grant is diligently prosecuting the matter.\nD. Hear the case due to the amicus interests.\n"

Hear the case due to the amicus interests.\n\nThe federal court should hear the case because the amicus briefs filed by fourteen groups supporting Imma's case indicate that there are significant amicus interests in the case. These briefs suggest that the regulation is discriminatory and unjust, and that the university's policy is not in the best interest of the students. Therefore, the court should consider the amicus briefs and the interests of the various groups in deciding whether to hear the case."
