The state has a statute prohibiting the installation and use of such devices. The resident is arrested and charged with violating this statute. The resident files a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the state statute.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest.\"\n     - This option suggests that the state statute is constitutional because it serves a legitimate state interest. However, the statute in question is a general prohibition on radar detection devices, which are not specifically related to interstate commerce. The state interest it protects is broader than the specific interest in radar detection devices.\n   - **Option B**: \"constitutional, because the commerce clause does not invalidate a state regulation relating to interstate commerce unless Congress takes express action to do so.\"\n     - This option suggests that the state statute is constitutional because it does not violate the commerce clause. However, the commerce clause is not relevant here because the statute is not related to interstate commerce.\n   - **Option C**: \"unconstitutional, because the state statute fails to give credit to the law of a neighboring state.\"\n     - This option suggests that the state statute is unconstitutional because it fails to give credit to the law of the neighboring state. However, the statute in question is a general prohibition on radar detection devices, which are not specifically related to interstate commerce. The state interest it protects is broader than the specific interest in radar detection devices.\n   - **Option D**: \"unconstitutional, because it unduly burdens interstate commerce.\"\n     - This option suggests that the state statute is unconstitutional because it unduly burdens interstate commerce. However, the statute in question is a general prohibition on radar detection devices, which are not specifically related to interstate commerce. The state interest it protects is broader than the specific interest in radar detection devices.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The most appropriate answer is **Option A**: \"constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest.\" This option correctly identifies that the state statute is constitutional because it serves a legitimate state interest, which is broader than the specific interest in radar detection devices.\n\nFinal Answer: A. constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest."
