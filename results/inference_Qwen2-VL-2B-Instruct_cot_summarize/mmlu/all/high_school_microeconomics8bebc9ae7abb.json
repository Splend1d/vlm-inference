For price discrimination to be successful, the firm must have market power, meaning it can charge different prices without the competition of other firms. Additionally, buyers with differing demand elasticities must be separable, meaning that the demand for the firm's product is not perfectly elastic across different segments of the market. The firm must also have motives beyond profit maximization, as it is not solely focused on maximizing profits. Finally, the firm must be able to prevent the re-sale of its products, as this would violate the principle of price discrimination."
