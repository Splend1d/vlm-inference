The experimental treatments are day-long classical music and day-long light rock music. The goal is to isolate the effect of music on piecework output.\n\nA control group that does not receive any music would be the most appropriate choice. This group would not be influenced by the experimental treatments and would provide a baseline for comparison. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A third group for which no music is played"
