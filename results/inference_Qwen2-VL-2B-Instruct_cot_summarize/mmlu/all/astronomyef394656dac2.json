The force of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the Earth. Therefore, if the distance from the center of the planet is halved, the force of gravity will be doubled.\n\nGiven that the mass of the sand bag is 5kg and the weight on Earth is 50N, we can calculate the weight on the planet with half the gravity as follows:\n\nWeight on the planet = Weight on Earth \u00d7 (distance from center of planet / distance from center of Earth)^2\n\nWeight on the planet = 50N \u00d7 (1/2)^2 = 50N \u00d7 1/4 = 12.5N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Mass 5kg weight 25N"
