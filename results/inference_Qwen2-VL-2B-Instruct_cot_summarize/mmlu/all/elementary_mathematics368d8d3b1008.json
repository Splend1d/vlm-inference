If the company makes 15 white cars in one day, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5 \\text{ blue cars}}{3 \\text{ white cars}} = \\frac{x \\text{ blue cars}}{15 \\text{ white cars}} \\]\n\nWhere \\(x\\) represents the number of blue cars the company will make. Solving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = 3 \\times x \\]\n\n\\[ 75 = 3x \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{75}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the company will make 25 blue cars in one day. The correct answer is D. 25."
