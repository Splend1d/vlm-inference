Nations specialize and trade based on absolute advantage in production.\n\nProduction possibility curves represent the maximum amount of goods and services that can be produced by a nation's resources. Nations can specialize in producing goods and services where they have an absolute advantage, meaning they can produce more of those goods and services than they can produce with the resources they have. This specialization allows nations to trade with each other, where each nation can consume goods and services that it produces in excess of its own production possibilities."
