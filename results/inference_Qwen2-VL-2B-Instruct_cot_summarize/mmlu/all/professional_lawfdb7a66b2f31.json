The statute enacted by Congress is a legislative act that sets conditions for joint military exercises with foreign military forces. The President's authority to engage in joint training exercises with foreign forces is not directly addressed by the statute, but rather by the President's constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, the statute is likely unconstitutional because it conflicts with the President's constitutional authority to execute the laws of the United States."
