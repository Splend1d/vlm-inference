In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.\nB. No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.\nC. Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.\n"

The key issue here is whether the homeowner's actions were intentional or reckless, and whether they were done with malice or ill will.\n\nThe homeowner's actions were not intentional or reckless. He did not intend to harm the neighbor's plants or cause damage to the property. He did not have malice or ill will. The neighbor's plants were damaged because of the accumulation of debris, not because of the homeowner's actions. The homeowner's actions were not the cause of the damage.\n\nTherefore, the court will likely find that the homeowner did not have the required intent to trespass or cause harm, and that the neighbor cannot prove that the homeowner intended to trespass or cause harm. The motion to dismiss will be granted. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will."
