These changes could include:\n\nA. Humility: Eugenic policies and practices could lead to a decrease in humility, as individuals may become overly focused on their own genetic superiority and neglect their social responsibilities and contributions to society.\n\nB. Responsibility: Genetic enhancement could lead to a decrease in responsibility, as individuals may become overly focused on their own genetic superiority and neglect their social responsibilities and contributions to society.\n\nC. Solidarity: Genetic enhancement could lead to a decrease in solidarity, as individuals may become overly focused on their own genetic superiority and neglect their social responsibilities and contributions to society.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. all of the above."
