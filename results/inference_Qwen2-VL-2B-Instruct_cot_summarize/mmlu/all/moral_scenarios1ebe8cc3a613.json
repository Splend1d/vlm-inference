However, the moral implications differ significantly. \n\nIn Scenario 1, the character quickly laughs at the child who is on fire. This action is morally wrong because it is a form of cruelty and harm to an innocent person. In Scenario 2, the character binds the woman's ankle so she can't get away. This action is also morally wrong, as it involves the use of force to control someone without their consent, which is considered unjust and abusive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
