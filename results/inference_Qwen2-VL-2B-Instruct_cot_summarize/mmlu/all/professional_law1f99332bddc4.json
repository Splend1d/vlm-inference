S. for the wholesale distribution of the guitars. A warehouse located in a city handles the distribution of guitars for several state areas. The guitars and guitar strings are shipped separately to the city warehouse. The guitar strings are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with various other guitar strings. The guitars, on the other hand, arrive completely assembled in their shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. The city imposes an ad valorem property tax on the guitars and strings. The power of the city to impose an ad valorem tax on the foreign company's guitars and/or strings would most likely be upheld under\n\nA. the commerce clause.\nB. the reserved power of the states as granted under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. the necessary and proper clause.\nD. the import and export clause.\n"

The reserved power of the states as granted under the Tenth Amendment.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" This clause grants states the power to regulate their own affairs, including taxation. Therefore, the city's power to impose an ad valorem property tax on the foreign company's guitars and strings would most likely be upheld under the Tenth Amendment, as it is a power reserved to the states.\n\nThe other options do not apply in this context:\n\nA. The commerce clause does not apply to property taxes.\nC. The necessary and proper clause is not relevant to property taxation.\nD. The import and export clause does not apply to property taxation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
