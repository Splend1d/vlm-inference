The half cycle current rating is the current that the SCR can handle for half a cycle of the supply frequency. \n\nFor a 50 Hz supply, the half cycle current rating is 3000 A.\n\nThe one cycle surge current rating is calculated as follows:\n\nOne cycle surge current = Half cycle surge current * 2\n\nOne cycle surge current = 3000 A * 2\nOne cycle surge current = 6000 A\n\nTherefore, the one cycle surge current rating is 6000 A."
