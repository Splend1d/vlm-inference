CT scan of the abdomen\n\nThis is because the patient has intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20 to 30 minutes after eating, which is consistent with symptoms of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. A CT scan of the abdomen can help to rule out other causes of abdominal pain, such as tumors or other abdominal conditions. It can also help to identify any abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract that may be causing the symptoms."
