This means that the solid is a cylinder with a radius of 1 unit and a height of 2 units (the diameter of the sphere minus the distance from the center to the plane). The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(h\\) is the height. In this case, the radius of the cylinder is 1 unit and the height is 2 units, so the volume of the cylinder is:\n\n\\[V = \\pi (1)^2 (2) = 2\\pi\\]\n\nThe volume of the solid is the difference between the volume of the sphere and the volume of the cylinder:\n\n\\[V_{\\text{solid}} = V_{\\text{sphere}} - V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi - 2\\pi = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi - \\frac{6}{3}\\pi = \\frac{26}{3}\\pi = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\), which corresponds to option D."
