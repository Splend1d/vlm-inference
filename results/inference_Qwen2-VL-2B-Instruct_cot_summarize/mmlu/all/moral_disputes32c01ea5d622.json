It suggests that the moral status of animals should be considered based on their marginal cases, meaning that they should be considered morally equivalent to humans only if they are in a marginal position, such as being in a state of suffering or being in a position of vulnerability. This argument challenges the idea that animals should be excluded from moral consideration based on their status as non-human entities."
