The diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological and religious values, results in a global system characterised by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.\n\nThe global political arena is indeed dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity. However, this does not necessarily mean that humanitarian intervention is always justified. There are many reasons why states may choose to intervene in another state's affairs, including self-defense, protecting human rights, and promoting democracy. It is important to consider the specific circumstances and motivations of each state before making a decision on whether or not to intervene in another state's affairs."
