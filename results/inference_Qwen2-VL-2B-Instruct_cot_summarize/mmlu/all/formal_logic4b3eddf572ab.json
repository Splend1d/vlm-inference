This can be broken down into two parts:\n1. If doctors are helpful, then doctors are helpful.\n2. If doctors are helpful, then patients are not rude.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. H \u2261 R\n- This means \"H is equivalent to R.\" This option does not capture the logical relationship between doctors being helpful and patients being rude.\n\nB. H \u2022 R\n- This means \"H and R are mutually exclusive.\" This option captures the idea that doctors being helpful and patients being rude are mutually exclusive, but it does not capture the logical implication that if doctors are helpful, then patients cannot be rude.\n\nC. H \u2228 ~R\n- This means \"H or ~R.\" This option captures the idea that doctors being helpful or patients being rude is a possibility, but it does not capture the logical implication that if doctors are helpful, then patients cannot be rude.\n\nD. H \u2228 R\n- This means \"H or R.\" This option captures the logical implication that if doctors are helpful, then patients cannot be rude. This option correctly reflects the sentence's meaning.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nD. H \u2228 R"
