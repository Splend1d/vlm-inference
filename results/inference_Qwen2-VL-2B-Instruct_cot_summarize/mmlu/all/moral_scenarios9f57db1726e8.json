According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, stealing is generally considered morally wrong. This is because it involves taking someone else's property without their consent, which is considered theft.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character realized that the homeowners weren't home so they climbed through the window. This action is not considered morally wrong in the same way as stealing. Climbing through a window is generally considered a legal and ethical way to enter someone's property, as it is a common practice for security purposes and does not involve taking someone else's property. Therefore, the main character's action in Scenario 2 is not considered morally wrong."
