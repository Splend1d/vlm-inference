This is considered morally wrong because it involves deception and is not consistent with the principles of honesty and integrity. In Scenario 2, the main character watered the neighbor's lawn once a week because he paid the neighbor for the whole summer he was away. This is considered morally wrong because it involves taking advantage of the neighbor's trust and not fulfilling a contractual obligation."
