In this context, the question \"At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?\" is not leading because it is not asking for a specific answer that the witness must provide to support the plaintiff's claim. Instead, it is asking about the defendant's actions during the assault.\n\n2. **Misleading Questions**: Misleading questions are those that are ambiguous or open-ended, making it difficult for the witness to provide a clear and relevant answer. The question \"At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?\" is not misleading because it is clear and straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the court will overrule the objection and allow the question to be asked during cross-examination. The correct answer is:\n\nD. The objection will be overruled because the question is not leading or misleading."
