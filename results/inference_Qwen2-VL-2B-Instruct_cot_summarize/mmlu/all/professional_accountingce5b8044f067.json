Calculate the daily revenue:\nDaily rental rate = $245 per hour\nNumber of hours per day = 2 hours\nDaily revenue = $245 x 2 hours = $490\n\n2. Calculate the annual revenue:\nThere are 365 days in a year\nAnnual revenue = $490 x 365 days = $177,950\n\n3. Calculate the annual costs:\nDaily costs = $50\nNumber of days per year = 365 days\nAnnual costs = $50 x 365 days = $18250\n\n4. Calculate the annual yield:\nAnnual yield = Annual revenue - Annual costs\nAnnual yield = $177,950 - $182,500 = -$4550\n\nSince the yield is negative, it means that the investment is not yielding a profit but rather a loss. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.45%"
