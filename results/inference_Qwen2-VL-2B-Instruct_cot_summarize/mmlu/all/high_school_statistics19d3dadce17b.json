The average time a fuse burns for Company II is 55 minutes, with a standard deviation of 5 minutes.\n\nFor Company I, the probability of a fuse lasting at least 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) is given by the formula:\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\text{Average fuse burn time} - \\text{Standard deviation}}{\\text{Standard deviation}}\\right) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{60 - 10}{10}\\right) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) = 1 - \\Phi(5) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) \\approx 1 - 0.6931 \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) \\approx 0.3069 \\]\n\nFor Company II, the probability of a fuse lasting at least 1 hour is:\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{55 - 5}{5}\\right) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) = 1 - \\Phi(10) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) \\approx 1 - 0.84159 \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Fuse lasts at least 1 hour}) \\approx 0.159 \\]\n\nComparing the probabilities:\n- For Company I: 0.3069\n- For Company II: 0.159\n\nThe probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour for Company II is 0.159, which is greater than the probability for Company I (0.3069).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB.
