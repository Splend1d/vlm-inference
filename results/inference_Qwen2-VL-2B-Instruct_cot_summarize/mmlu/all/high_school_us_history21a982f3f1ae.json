I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nPuritan emigration from England came to a near halt between the years 1649 and 1660 because, during that period,\n\nA. most English Puritans were imprisoned for heresy\nB. most Puritans converted to Catholicism\nC. the New England settlement had become too overcrowded, and colonial legislatures strongly discouraged immigration\nD. the Puritans controlled the English government\n"

Williams argues that the Puritans' belief in the separation of church and state led to a lack of civil power and a lack of religious freedom in the New England colonies. He also criticizes the imposition of religious and civil laws on the people, which he believes is contrary to the teachings of Christ.\n\nGiven this context, the question asks which of the following statements is not supported by the passage.\n\nA. Most English Puritans were imprisoned for heresy\nB. Most Puritans converted to Catholicism\nC. The New England settlement had become too overcrowded, and colonial legislatures strongly discouraged immigration\nD. The Puritans controlled the English government\n\nThe passage does not discuss the imprisonment of English Puritans for heresy, nor does it mention the conversion of most Puritans to Catholicism. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Most English Puritans were imprisoned for heresy"
