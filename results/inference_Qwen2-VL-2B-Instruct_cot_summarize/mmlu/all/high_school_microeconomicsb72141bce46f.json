The industry uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes.\n2. This suggests that the industry is not a major consumer of plastic.\n\nGiven that the industry uses a small fraction of the plastic, it implies that the cost of producing the plastic army figures is relatively low compared to the total demand for plastic. This indicates that the industry is likely to have a low cost structure, which is a characteristic of a profit-making industry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. profit-making industry"
