It is used to ensure that the number of electrons in each atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. BaCl2 + Al2(SO4)3 \u2192 AlCl3 + BaSO4\n- This equation is already balanced. The number of electrons in each atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus.\n\nB. H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O\n- This equation is already balanced. The number of electrons in each atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus.\n\nC. NaOH + H3PO4 \u2192 Na2HPO4 + H2O\n- This equation is already balanced. The number of electrons in each atom is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus.\n\nD. C2H2(g) + N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g)\n- This equation is not balanced. The number of electrons in each atom is not equal to the number of protons in its nucleus. For example, the number of electrons in the carbon atom is 4, while the number of protons is 6. This indicates that the equation is not balanced.\n\nTherefore, the equation that may need to be balanced using the ion-electron method is:\n\nD. C2H2(g) + N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g)"
