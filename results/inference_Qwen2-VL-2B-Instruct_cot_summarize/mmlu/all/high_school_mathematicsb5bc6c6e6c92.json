The series given is:\n\n\\[2, -2 \\times 2, -2 \\times (-2) \\times 2, -2 \\times (-2) \\times (-2) \\times 2, \\ldots\\]\n\nLet's examine the pattern:\n\n- The first term is 2.\n- The second term is \\(-2 \\times 2 = -4\\).\n- The third term is \\(-2 \\times (-2) \\times 2 = -8\\).\n- The fourth term is \\(-2 \\times (-2) \\times (-2) \\times 2 = -16\\).\n\nSo, the pattern is that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by -2. To find the 5th term, we multiply the 4th term by -2:\n\n\\[ -16 \\times (-2) = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the 5th term in the series is 32. The correct answer is B."
