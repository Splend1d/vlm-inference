After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nWhich of the following best reflects the perspective of Jane Addams in the passage above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which perspective best reflects Jane Addams' perspective in the passage, let's analyze the context and the core of the question.\n\nThe passage describes a meeting at Hull House during a strike, where the strikers discussed the possibility of forming a boarding club. The girls who were most easily frightened and the first to capitulate were those who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell behind. The girls' desire for a club to support them during the strike is highlighted.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Poor people need the leadership of reformers like herself.**\n   - This option suggests that reformers like Jane Addams are responsible for helping poor people. However, the passage does not explicitly state that Addams is the reformer leading the movement. It focuses more on the girls' desire for a club and their fear of being put out if they fall behind.\n\nB. **Poor people need support in helping themselves.**\n   - This option aligns well with the passage. It reflects the girls' desire for a club to support them during the strike, indicating that they need support in helping themselves.\n\nC. **Poor people don't need outside help.**\n   - This option contradicts the passage, which clearly mentions the girls' desire for a club to support them during the strike.\n\nD. **Poor people don't deserve help.**\n   - This option is incorrect as the passage does not imply that the girls are not deserving of help.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best reflection of Jane Addams' perspective in the passage is:\n\n**B. Poor people need support in helping themselves.**"
