She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with \"deviate sexual intercourse\", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n"

The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n\nThe reasoning behind this holding would be that the statute in question is a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations, which is a criminal act. The Supreme Court would likely conclude that this statute is not a valid exercise of the state's authority to regulate sexual morality, as it is not a legitimate exercise of the state's power to regulate consensual sexual activity between adults of the same sex. The Court would likely hold that the statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes on the men's right to privacy, which is protected by the Fourth Amendment."
