This lack of barriers to entry can lead to a situation where firms are not incentivized to invest in new technologies or processes, as they do not face the risk of being outcompeted by new entrants. As a result, firms may not invest in research and development, which can lead to a decrease in productivity and efficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
