The marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve for a monopoly.\n\nA monopoly is a market structure where a single seller or producer has the ability to set prices and control the quantity of a product sold. In such a market, the marginal revenue curve (MR) is below the demand curve (D) because the marginal revenue is the additional revenue generated by selling one more unit of the product. Since the demand curve is downward sloping, the marginal revenue curve will be below the demand curve, indicating that the marginal revenue is less than the price charged for each additional unit sold.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation for why monopolies need to lower their prices to sell more units of their product is that the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve."
