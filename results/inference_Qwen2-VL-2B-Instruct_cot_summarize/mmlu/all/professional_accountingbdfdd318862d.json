It is easier to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle than it is to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a correction of an error.\n\nThis is because accounting estimates are typically based on historical data and assumptions, while accounting principles are based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Changes in accounting estimates are typically based on new information or changes in the business environment, while changes in accounting principles are based on changes in GAAP. Therefore, it is easier to differentiate between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting principles than it is to differentiate between changes in accounting estimates and changes in GAAP."
