An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of \"willingly and knowingly\" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.\nB. Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.\nC. No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.\nD. No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n"

However, the trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is not a defense. This means that the owner must have known the law or intended to commit the crime.\n\n2. **Specific Intent**: The owner's defense also relies on the idea that he did not have a specific intent to commit the crime. However, the trial judge's instruction that mistake of law is not a defense implies that the owner must have had a specific intent to commit the crime.\n\nGiven that the owner must have known the law and intended to commit the crime, the appellate court is likely to find that the owner's defense is not valid. The conviction is based on the owner's knowledge of the law and his intent to commit the crime, which are both required elements of the crime.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.**"
