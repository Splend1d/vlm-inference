In Scenario 1, giving a chocolate bar to a four-year-old daughter is generally considered a harmless and appropriate gift for dinner. In Scenario 2, tearing the price tag off of a child's toy is generally considered a harmless and appropriate action. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these actions is clearly morally wrong."
