He said to the roofer, \"We'll have a deal when you begin to do the work necessary for this job.\" The roofer did not directly respond to the offer but he went out and purchased the supplies and materials needed for the homeowner's specifications. When he arrived at the site with the supplies he found a message from the homeowner that he revoked the offer. Can the homeowner revoke the offer under these circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\nB. No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation.\nC. No, because the offer had to remain open for a reasonable period of time before it could be revoked.\nD. Yes, because an oral offer to enter a bilateral contract is never enforceable.\n"

A bilateral contract is one in which both parties agree to the terms of the contract and both parties are bound by the terms. In this case, the homeowner's offer was an offer to enter into a bilateral contract.\n\nThe roofer's purchase of the supplies and materials was an act of acceptance of the homeowner's offer. This acceptance is considered to be effective when the roofer has purchased the necessary supplies and materials for the homeowner's specifications. Therefore, the act of purchasing the supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance of the homeowner's offer.\n\nWhen the homeowner revoked the offer, he was revoking the offer to enter into a bilateral contract. Since the offer was an offer to enter into a bilateral contract, the homeowner cannot revoke the offer under these circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation."
