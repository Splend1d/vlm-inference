                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of continuity, which states that the volume of fluid flowing through a pipe per unit of time is constant. This principle can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\text{constant} \\]\n\nwhere \\( dV \\) is the change in volume of fluid per unit of time, and \\( t \\) is time.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the cross-sections of the pipe) is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the cross-section and \\( h \\) is the height (or length) of the cylinder.\n\nFor the first point, the diameter is 2 cm, so the radius \\( r_1 \\) is 1 cm. The flow speed at this point is 18 m/s. Substituting these values into the volume formula gives:\n\n\\[ V_1 = \\pi (1)^2 (18) = 18\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{s} \\]\n\nFor the second point, the diameter is 3 cm, so the radius \\( r_2 \\) is 1.5 cm. Substituting these values into the volume formula gives:\n\n\\[ V_2 = \\pi (1.5)^2 (18) = 27\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{s} \\]\n\nThe flow speed at the second point is the change in volume divided by the change in time, which is the flow rate. The flow rate is the volume per unit of time, so we can write:\n\n\\[ \\text{Flow rate} = \\frac{V_2 - V_1}{t} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Flow rate} = \\frac{27\\pi - 18\\pi}{t} = \\frac{9\\pi}{t} \\]\n\nSince \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14 \\), we can approximate \\( \\frac{9\\pi}{t} \\) as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Flow rate} \\approx \\frac{9 \\times 3.14}{t} \\approx 28.28 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{s} \\]\n\nTo convert this to meters per second, we multiply by \\( \\frac{10000}{1} \\):\n\n\\[ \\text{Flow rate} \\approx 28280 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{s} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Flow rate} \\approx 28.28 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the flow speed at the second point is approximately 28.28 m/s, which is closest to option C."
