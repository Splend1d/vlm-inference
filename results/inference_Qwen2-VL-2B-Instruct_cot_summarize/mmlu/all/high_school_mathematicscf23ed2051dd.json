                    "text": " Let's denote the width of the rectangle as $w$ and the length as $l$. According to the problem, we have $l = 2w$. The diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that $d = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}$, where $d$ is the diagonal and $l$ and $w$ are the length and width of the rectangle, respectively.\n\nGiven that the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$, we can substitute $l = 2w$ into the Pythagorean theorem to get:\n\n\\[5\\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{(2w)^2 + w^2}\\]\n\nSquaring both sides to get rid of the square root gives:\n\n\\[25 \\cdot 5 = (2w)^2 + w^2\\]\n\n\\[125 = 4w^2 + w^2\\]\n\n\\[125 = 5w^2\\]\n\n\\[w^2 = 25\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\n\\[w = 5\\]\n\nSince $l = 2w$, we can find $l$:\n\n\\[l = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10\\]\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width, so the area of this rectangle is:\n\n\\[A = l \\cdot w = 10 \\cdot 5 = 50\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 50, which corresponds to option C. The answer is: $C$."
