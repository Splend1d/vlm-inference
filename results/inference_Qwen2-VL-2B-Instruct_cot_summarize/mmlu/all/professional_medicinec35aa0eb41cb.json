He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?\n\nA. Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor\nB. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\nC. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome)\nD. Normal development\n"

Normal development\n\nThis is because the patient is at the 50th percentile for height and weight, which is typically within the normal range for a healthy adolescent. Additionally, the patient's breast development is Tanner stage 3, which is also within the normal range for a healthy adolescent. The presence of bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses and normal pubic hair development also suggests that this is a normal developmental process rather than a pathological condition."
