If the conclusion is false, then at least one of the premises must be false. Therefore, if the conclusion cannot be true, then at least one of the premises must be false. This means that the syllogism is formally invalid.\n\nThe other options do not necessarily mean that the syllogism is formally invalid:\n\nA. cannot be materially true - This is not necessarily true. It could be that the conclusion is false, but the premises are true.\n\nB. might be materially true - This is not necessarily true. It could be that the conclusion is true, but the premises are false.\n\nC. might be materially untrue - This is not necessarily true. It could be that the conclusion is false, but the premises are true.\n\nD. both B and C - This is not necessarily true.
