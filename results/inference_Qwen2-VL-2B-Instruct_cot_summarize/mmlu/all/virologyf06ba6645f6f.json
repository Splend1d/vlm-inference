Even in combination current drugs do not completely block viral replication\n\nHIV is a retrovirus that uses reverse transcriptase to synthesize new viral RNA from its DNA template. Current antiretroviral drugs, such as protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors, target different stages of the viral life cycle. However, these drugs do not completely block viral replication, as they only inhibit the enzymes that are necessary for the replication process. This means that the virus can still replicate and spread, even when the drugs are being taken."
