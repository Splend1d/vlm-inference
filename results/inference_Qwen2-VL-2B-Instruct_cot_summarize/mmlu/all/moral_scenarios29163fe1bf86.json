This action is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The act of looking at the answer on their hand is a common practice in many educational settings, and it is not considered morally wrong unless it is done in a way that is harmful or disrespectful to the person being tested.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character fired the gun at the child's eye at the shooting range. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The act of shooting at someone's eye is considered a violent and dangerous act that can cause serious harm or even death. It is not acceptable to harm someone intentionally, even if it is done in a moment of crisis or emergency."
