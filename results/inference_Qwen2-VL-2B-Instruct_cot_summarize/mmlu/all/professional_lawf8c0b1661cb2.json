A lawyer for the movie studio negotiated an agreement with the screenwriter whereby the movie studio would pay the screenwriter $5,000 for the rights to the screenplay, and 10 percent of the gross receipts earned by the distribution of the movie, should the studio decide to film the screenplay. Both sides signed the agreement. Two weeks later, the screenwriter was at a birthday party for a close friend when she discovered she had forgotten to purchase a gift for her friend. She quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it:\"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay. \"The screenwriter then signed the paper, placed it in an envelope, and handed it to the friend. The promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend may best be interpreted as a (an)\n\nA. equitable lien.\nB. conditional assignment.\nC. irrevocable assignment.\nD. gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n"

This is because the promise is contingent on the movie studio deciding to film the screenplay, which is a condition precedent to the promise. If the movie studio decides to film the screenplay, the screenwriter will be entitled to the 5 percent of the proceeds. If the studio does not decide to film the screenplay, the screenwriter will not be entitled to the 5 percent of the proceeds. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. conditional assignment."
