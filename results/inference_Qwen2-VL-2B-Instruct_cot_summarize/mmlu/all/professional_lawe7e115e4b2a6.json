Wife died and the husband filed to evict his stepson. According to the majority view among the states, can the stepson prevail by asserting his deed from his mother?\n\nA. Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\nB. Yes, the son became a tenant by the entireties with his mother's husband upon his mother's death.\nC. No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\nD. No, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting the approval of all of her children.\n"

No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The husband and wife owned the land as tenants by the entirety. When marital problems arose, the wife conveyed her interest in the real estate to her son from a prior marriage, who became the sole owner of the property.\n\n2. **Legal Principle**: In most jurisdictions, the entireties estate is a type of ownership where the property is owned by the husband and wife jointly, and the husband has the right to sell or transfer the property to his heirs. However, the entireties estate can be broken with the consent of both parties.\n\n3. **Effect of the Deed**: The deed from the wife to her son was valid and effective. It severed the entireties estate and transferred the property to the son, who now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The husband cannot evict his stepson based on the deed from his mother because the entireties estate was broken with the consent of both parties (husband and wife). Therefore, the stepson can prevail by asserting his deed from his mother.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C."
