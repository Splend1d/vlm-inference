She says the claim is implausible.\n\nHursthouse's position is that any adequate action-guiding theory must provide clear guidance about what ought and ought not to be done, which is a fundamental aspect of moral theory. However, she argues that this claim is implausible because it is difficult to determine what constitutes clear guidance. She suggests that the difficulty arises from the fact that moral judgments are inherently subjective and vary from person to person, making it impossible to provide a universally applicable set of rules."
