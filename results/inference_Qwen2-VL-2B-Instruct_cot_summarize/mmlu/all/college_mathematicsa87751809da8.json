                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of x that satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x. \n\nFirst, let's recall the properties of the cosine function. The cosine of an angle is equal to the sine of its complement. That is, cos(\u03b8) = sin(90\u00b0 - \u03b8). \n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation cos(97x) = x as sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = x. \n\nThis equation implies that the angle 90\u00b0 - 97x is a solution to the equation x. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of x. Since x is a positive number, we need to find the values of x that satisfy the equation sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = x. \n\nThe sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants. Therefore, we need to consider the values of x in these quadrants. \n\nIn the first quadrant, the sine function is positive. So, we need to find the values of x that satisfy sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = x. \n\nIn the second quadrant, the sine function is negative. So, we need to find the values of x that satisfy sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = -x. \n\nLet's consider the first case. \n\nIf x is positive, then 90\u00b0 - 97x is negative. So, we need to find the values of x that satisfy sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = x. \n\nSince sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = x, we have x = sin(90\u00b0 - 97x). \n\nThis equation implies that the angle 90\u00b0 - 97x is a solution to the equation x. \n\nNow, let's consider the second case. \n\nIf x is negative, then 90\u00b0 - 97x is positive. So, we need to find the values of x that satisfy sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = -x. \n\nSince sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = -x, we have x = -sin(90\u00b0 - 97x). \n\nThis equation implies that the angle 90\u00b0 - 97x is a solution to the equation x. \n\nTherefore, the positive values of x that satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x are the solutions to the equation sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = x. \n\nSince the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants, the positive values of x that satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x are the solutions to the equation sin(90\u00b0 - 97x) = x. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive values of x that satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x is 1. \n\nSo, the answer is A. 1."
