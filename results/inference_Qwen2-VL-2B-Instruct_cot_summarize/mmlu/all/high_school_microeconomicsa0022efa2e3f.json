This is long run constant returns to scale.\n\nThis is because the output increases by 25 units (375 - 350) when 1 more unit of labor is added, which is the same as the increase in output when 2 more units of labor are added (350 - 300). This indicates that the marginal product of labor is constant, which is characteristic of constant returns to scale."
