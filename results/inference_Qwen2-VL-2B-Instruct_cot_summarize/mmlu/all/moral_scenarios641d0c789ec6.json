This action is generally considered morally wrong because it is a form of deception or manipulation, which can harm the other person's self-esteem and trust. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is insisting on spots for themselves and their doll in a bomb shelter. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a practical decision made to ensure the safety of the people in the shelter."
