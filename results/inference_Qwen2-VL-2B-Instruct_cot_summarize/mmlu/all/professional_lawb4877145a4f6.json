Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?\n\nA. For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.\nB. For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.\nC. For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to decide in favor of the cousin, as the court will consider the priority of the conveyances and the subsequent good-faith donee's right to possession and quiet title.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Priority of Conveyances**: The court will look at the priority of the conveyances. The cousin conveyed the land to her cousin six months before the friend conveyed it to her friend. The cousin's conveyance was recorded, while the friend's was not. Therefore, the cousin is considered the first in time.\n\n2. **Recorded Conveyances**: The court will consider whether the friend's deed was recorded. Since the cousin's deed was recorded, the friend's deed is not considered valid against subsequent purchasers for value without notice. The friend's deed is not recorded, and therefore, it is not valid.\n\n3. **Priority of Donee**: The court will consider whether the cousin's deed was done in good faith. The cousin conveyed the land to her cousin, and the cousin recorded her deed. The cousin's deed was done in good faith, as it was done in the absence of any notice of the friend's deed.\n\n4. **Priority of Possession**: The court will consider whether the cousin's deed was done in good faith and whether the cousin was the first in possession. The cousin conveyed the land to her cousin six months before the friend conveyed it to her friend. The cousin was the first in possession, and the friend did not take possession until six months after the cousin conveyed the land.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to decide in favor of the cousin because the cousin conveyed the land in good faith and was the first in possession, while the friend did not record his deed and did not take possession until six months after the cousin conveyed the land.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.**"
