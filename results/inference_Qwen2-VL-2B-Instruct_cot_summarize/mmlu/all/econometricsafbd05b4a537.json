(ii), (iii), and (iv) only.\n\nOver-identified systems of simultaneous equations refer to situations where there are more equations than there are independent variables. This can lead to over-identification, where the system has more equations than there are independent variables, which can result in biased estimates. \n\nThe estimation techniques available for over-identified systems include:\n\n- **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: This is a standard estimation technique for linear regression models, but it assumes that the errors are normally distributed and that there are no omitted variables. It is not suitable for over-identified systems.\n\n- **2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares)**: This technique is used when there are more equations than there are independent variables. It involves two stages: first, estimating the equations using OLS, and then using the estimated coefficients to estimate the equations using OLS. This method is used to correct for endogeneity.\n\n- **IV (Instrumental Variables)**: This technique is used when there are more equations than there are independent variables. It involves using an instrument to instrumentally identify the omitted variables. This method is used to correct for endogeneity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. (ii), (iii), and (iv) only."
