We can use the information that \\(20\\%\\) of the contaminant is removed in the first minute to find the rate of removal and then use that to find the time it takes to remove the remaining \\(80\\%\\).\n\nThe rate of removal is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining, so we can write:\n\n\\[R = \\frac{C}{T}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(20\\%\\) of the contaminant is removed in the first minute, we can find the rate of removal in the first minute:\n\n\\[R_{1} = \\frac{0.2C}{1} = 0.2C\\]\n\nSince \\(20\\%\\) of the contaminant is removed in the first minute, the remaining contaminant is \\(80\\%\\). We can use the rate of removal in the first minute to find the time it takes to remove the remaining \\(80\\%\\):\n\n\\[0.8C = 0.2C \\times T\\]\n\nSolving for \\(T\\):\n\n\\[T = \\frac{0.8C}{0.2C} = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, the decontamination process will take approximately 4 minutes, which corresponds to option B."
