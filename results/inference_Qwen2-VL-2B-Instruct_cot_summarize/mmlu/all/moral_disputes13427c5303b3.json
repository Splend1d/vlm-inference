This principle is based on the idea that actions that are in harmony with the natural order and the laws of nature are inherently right.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"The action only indirectly violates some of the basic values.\"\n- This option suggests that the action is right because it only indirectly violates some basic values. However, this is not necessarily the case. An action that indirectly violates some basic values could still be considered right if it is in harmony with the natural order and the laws of nature.\n\nB. \"The action is of a type that the laws of natural selection have favored.\"\n- This option suggests that the action is right because it is in line with the laws of natural selection. While this might be a factor, it is not the sole basis for determining rightness. Natural selection is a process that operates on the basis of survival of the fittest, but it does not necessarily determine the rightness of an action.\n\nC. \"In performing the action one does not directly violate any of the basic values.\"\n- This option suggests that the action is right because it does not directly violate any of the basic values. This is a strong basis for determining rightness, as it implies that the action is in harmony with the natural order and the inherent principles of the universe.\n\nD. \"None of the above\"\n- This option suggests that none of the above factors are sufficient to determine rightness. This is not necessarily the case. While some factors may be less important or less directly relevant, they do not necessarily negate the importance of others.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most comprehensive and strong basis for determining rightness in natural law theory is option C: \"In performing the action one does not directly violate any of the basic values.\"\n\nFinal answer: C. In performing the action one does not directly violate any of the basic values."
