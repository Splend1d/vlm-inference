It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?\n\nA. Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\nB. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u0080\u0093 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\nC. No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimus\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\nD. No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n"

The clause states that time is of the essence, meaning that the delay in making the application is a significant issue.\n\n2. **Purchaser's Actions**: The purchaser failed to make the application within the agreed time. This delay is a \"de minimus\" delay, which means it is not a significant delay that would preclude the benefit of the bargain.\n\n3. **Seller's Response**: The seller rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. This rescission occurred prior to the purchaser notifying her of the approval. The first notice communicated is the effective one.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The seller's rescission was effective because the delay was a \"de minimus\" delay, and the purchaser did not make a timely application within the agreed time. Therefore, the purchaser did not benefit from the contingency clause, and the seller can rescind the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**: B. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u0080\u0093 the first notice communicated is the effective one."
