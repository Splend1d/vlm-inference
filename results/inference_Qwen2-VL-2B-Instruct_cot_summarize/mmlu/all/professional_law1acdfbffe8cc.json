A corporation who provides cable television services successfully persuaded the state legislature to grant it an exclusive right to install cable television lines in all multiple family dwellings in the state, in exchange for the corporation's promise to freeze cable television rates for the next four years. An owner of several large multifamily apartment buildings in the state brought an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state legislation. The suit claimed that the space used by the corporation when it subsequently installed cable television lines in one of his apartment buildings amounted to a taking without compensation. In this action, the owner will be awarded\n\nA. no relief, because easements for utility lines are presumed to be beneficial to the servient estate.\nB. no relief, because the legislation is merely a regulation of the use of property and not a taking.\nC. no relief, because the corporation is not a government entity.\nD. damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n"

No relief, because the legislation is merely a regulation of the use of property and not a taking.\n\nThe owner of the apartment buildings is challenging the constitutionality of the state legislation, which grants an exclusive right to install cable television lines in all multiple family dwellings in the state in exchange for the corporation's promise to freeze cable television rates for the next four years. The owner claims that the space used by the corporation when it subsequently installed cable television lines in one of his apartment buildings amounted to a taking without compensation.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the state legislation constitutes a \"taking\" of the owner's property. A taking occurs when the state or a public entity acquires private property without compensation. In this case, the corporation is a private entity, and the state legislature is a public entity. Therefore, the owner cannot claim that the state legislation constitutes a taking without compensation.\n\nThe owner's claim is that the corporation's installation of cable television lines in his apartment buildings amounted to a taking without compensation, which is not supported by the facts of the case. The owner's argument is based on the presumption that easements for utility lines are presumed to be beneficial to the servient estate, but this presumption does not apply to the corporation's installation of cable television lines.\n\nTherefore, the owner will not be awarded any relief in this case, as the state legislation is not a taking without compensation."
