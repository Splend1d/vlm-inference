According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is considered morally wrong because it involves the use of physical force or restriction to control behavior, which is generally considered harsh and inappropriate. \n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is putting face paint on the small child's face, which is a form of entertainment or personal expression. This action is generally considered morally acceptable because it is a form of personal choice and does not involve the use of physical force or restriction."
