The state legislature recently passed a highly controversial bill that, inter alia, reduces \"good driver\" automobile insurance rates and prohibits price-fixing and discrimination by insurance companies. This bill passed despite a well-financed and intense lobbying effort mounted by the insurance industry. After this law was enacted, an insurance agent who is a resident of the state, was interviewed by the local newspaper and publicly stated, \"the legislature is a bunch of self-serving crooks. \" After the statement made newspaper headlines, the state legislature enacted a statute providing that \"the state insurance license of the insurance agent is henceforth revoked. \" Astonished by the legislature's action, the insurance agent, who remains unrepentant, seeks your legal advice. You should advise the insurance agent that the state statute revoking her state insurance license is\n\nA. constitutional, because a state license is a privilege and not a right and, therefore, it is not protected by the due process clause.\nB. unconstitutional, because it denies her the equal protection of the laws.\nC. unconstitutional, because it is a prohibited bill of attainder.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is a denial of a privilege or immunity protected by Article IV.\n"

The insurance agent is a resident of the state and has a state insurance license.\n2. The state legislature enacted a statute revoking her state insurance license.\n3. The statute is based on the state's general licensing laws, which are not protected by the due process clause.\n4. The due process clause protects the rights of individuals to be free from arbitrary deprivation of property without due process of law.\n5. The statute revoking the insurance license is based on the state's general licensing laws, which are not protected by the due process clause.\n6. Therefore, the statute revoking the insurance license is unconstitutional because it denies the insurance agent the privilege or immunity protected by Article IV.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The due process clause does not protect the privilege or immunity of a state license.\nB. The statute does not deny the insurance agent the equal protection of the laws.\nC. The statute does not constitute a prohibited bill of attainder."
