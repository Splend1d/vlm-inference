The college student took the complaint papers that were approved by the prosecution and filed them with a magistrate court. An ongoing police investigation later determined, however, that the college student was a vengeful person not averse to creating stories, and that he and the former roommate had been arguing over several related issues. They also determined that he never had any quality sound or video equipment. The police dropped the prosecution, and the criminal case was dismissed at the preliminary hearing. When the former roommate filed a civil case against the college student alleging the tort of malicious prosecution, will evidence of the student's reputation for dishonesty be admissible and why?\n\nA. Yes, because dishonesty at any time in the past is always relevant to a malicious prosecution complaint.\nB. Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case.\nC. Yes, because reputation evidence, just like most character evidence, is virtually always admissible.\nD. Yes, because while most character evidence is not admissible, some is, and reputation evidence is always admissible.\n"

Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The scenario involves a criminal case where the college student initiated a complaint against his former roommate, claiming he removed his state-of-the-art home theater equipment. The police investigation revealed that the student was vengeful and that the former roommate had been arguing over unrelated issues. The police dropped the prosecution, and the case was dismissed at the preliminary hearing.\n\n2. **Reputation Evidence**: The former roommate filed a civil case against the college student alleging malicious prosecution. The court will consider evidence of the student's reputation for dishonesty as part of the case. This is because the civil case is directly related to the criminal case and the student's reputation is a key element in the civil case.\n\n3. **Admissibility of Reputation Evidence**: While reputation evidence is generally considered too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it can be admissible if it is directly at issue in the case. In this scenario, the court will consider the student's reputation for dishonesty as directly relevant to the civil case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case."
