Does the book value of the asset given up exceed the fair value of the asset received?\n- This question is about the difference between the book value and the fair value of the assets exchanged. If the book value exceeds the fair value, it suggests that the exchange may not be commercially reasonable because the asset given up is overvalued relative to the asset received.\n\nB. Is the gain on the exchange less than the increase in future cash flows?\n- This question is about the net gain or loss on the exchange. If the gain is less than the increase in future cash flows, it indicates that the exchange is commercially reasonable because the asset received is expected to provide more value than the asset given up.\n\nC. Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n- This question is about the impact of the exchange on future cash flows. If the cash flows are expected to change significantly, it suggests that the exchange may not be commercially reasonable because the asset received may not provide the same level of future value as the asset given up.\n\nD. Is the exchange nontaxable?\n- This question is about the tax treatment of the exchange. If the exchange is nontaxable, it does not affect the commercial substance of the exchange.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most relevant question to determine commercial substance is:\n\nA. Does the book value of the asset given up exceed the fair value of the asset received?\n\nIf the book value of the asset given up exceeds the fair value of the asset received, it suggests that the exchange may not be commercially reasonable because the asset given up is overvalued relative to the asset received."
