He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, \"Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?\" He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays. The resulting interval was (\u20130.23, \u20130.18). Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?\n\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nD. Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\n"

In this case, the interval is (\u20130.23, \u20130.18), which means:\n\n- The lower limit of the interval is \u20130.23, indicating that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is less than the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\n- The upper limit of the interval is \u20130.18, indicating that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is greater than the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the interval is:\n\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays."
