It tested the ability of human beings to adapt.\n\nThe late Pleistocene to early Holocene climate change was a period of significant environmental change that affected human populations in various ways. The shift from a cooler, more arid climate to a warmer, more humid climate had a profound impact on human societies and cultures. This change led to the development of new technologies, such as agriculture and the construction of shelters, which allowed humans to adapt to the changing environment and survive. The ability of human beings to adapt to these changes was crucial for their survival and the development of modern human societies."
