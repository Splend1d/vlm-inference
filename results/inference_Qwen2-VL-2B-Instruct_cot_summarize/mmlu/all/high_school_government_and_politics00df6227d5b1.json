Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Representatives' constituents more often belong largely to the representative's party.\n- This is a plausible reason because representatives have a direct line of communication with their constituents, which can help them build a strong base of support.\n\nB. Senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly contested more aggressively.\n- This is also a plausible reason because senators have more influence and can use their power to campaign effectively, which can increase their chances of winning.\n\nC. Representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents.\n- This is a plausible reason because representatives can use federal funds to advertise their accomplishments, which can help them gain support from constituents.\n\nD. Representatives more often run uncontested.\n- This is not a plausible reason because uncontested elections are less common for representatives than for senators. Representatives often face strong opposition from other candidates, which can make it more difficult for them to win reelection.\n\nTherefore, the reason why incumbent members of the House of Representatives win reelection more often than incumbent senators is EXCEPT:\n\nD. Representatives more often run uncontested."
