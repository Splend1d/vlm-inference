In this case, we have two subspaces: V and W.\n\nThe dimension of V is the number of linearly independent vectors in V. Since V is the vector space of all real polynomials of degree at most 3, and polynomials of degree at most 3 are linearly independent, the dimension of V is 4.\n\nThe dimension of W is the number of linearly independent vectors in W. Since W is the subspace of all polynomials p(x) in V such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0, and polynomials of degree at most 3 are linearly independent, the dimension of W is also 4.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of V + dim W is 4 + 4 = 8. However, the question asks for the dimension of V + dim W, which is 8. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 7."
