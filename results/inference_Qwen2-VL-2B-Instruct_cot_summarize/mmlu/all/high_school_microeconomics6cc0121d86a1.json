In an elastic demand market, consumers are more sensitive to price changes and are willing to pay more for a product or service. Therefore, the seller can charge higher prices to these segments to cover the additional costs of serving them. In an inelastic demand market, consumers are less sensitive to price changes and are willing to pay less for a product or service. Therefore, the seller can charge lower prices to these segments to cover the additional costs of serving them."
