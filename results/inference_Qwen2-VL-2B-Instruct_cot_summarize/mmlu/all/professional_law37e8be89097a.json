Because the architect had a history of substance abuse problems, the parties agreed that the developer's duty to accept and pay for the plans was conditioned on the architect's abstaining from drinking alcohol during the six months it would take to do the work. After two months, the architect began having several alcoholic drinks each day. The developer became aware of the architect's drinking before the architect showed the developer the preliminary plans. When the developer saw the preliminary plans, the developer told the architect that the concept was impressive and that he looked forward to seeing the final plans. The architect continued to have several alcoholic drinks each day and completed the plans within the specified contract period. However, the developer declined to review, accept, or pay for the final plans and stated that it was because of the architect's continued use of alcohol. The architect has sued the developer for breach of contract. Which of the following arguments best supports the architect's claim?\n\nA. The alcohol use was not a material breach of contract by the architect, since it did not affect the quality of the work.\nB. The developer waived the condition of no alcohol use.\nC. The no-alcohol term was functionally a penalty clause and therefore was unenforceable.\nD. The no-alcohol term would be interpreted as a promise and not a condition.\n"
