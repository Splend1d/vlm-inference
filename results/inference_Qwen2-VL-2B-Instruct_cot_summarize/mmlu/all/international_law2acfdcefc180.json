Mediation is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission, which proceeds to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposes settlement terms.\n\nExplanation:\n- Conciliation is a process where a neutral third party, often a mediator, helps the parties involved in a dispute to reach a settlement. The mediator does not have the authority to impose a binding decision, but rather helps the parties to work through their differences and come to an agreement.\n- Mediation, on the other hand, is a process where a neutral third party, often a mediator, helps the parties involved in a dispute to reach a settlement. The mediator does have the authority to impose a binding decision, which is often referred to as a \"mediation order\" or \"mediation agreement.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
