A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?\n\nA. Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\nC. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n"

Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.**\n   - This option addresses the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which is not directly relevant to the defamation claim in question.\n\nB. **A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.**\n   - This option pertains to the rules governing congressional hearings and does not address defamation claims.\n\nC. **The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.**\n   - This option directly addresses the requirement for actual malice in a defamation case. It states that for a defamation claim to succeed, the defamed party must prove that the statements were made with actual malice, which is a key element of the defamation doctrine.\n\nD. **It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.**\n   - This option discusses the due process and First Amendment rights of congressional committee members, which are not relevant to the defamation claim.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the question, the most accurate summary of the applicable rule of law is:\n\n**C. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C."
