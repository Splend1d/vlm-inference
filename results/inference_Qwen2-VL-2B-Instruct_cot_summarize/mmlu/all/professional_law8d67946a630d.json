                    "text": "An actress went to a plastic surgeon for removal of an abnormal growth on her right cheek. Under a written contract, the plastic surgeon agreed to surgically remove the growth for $1,000. As the actress subsequently recalled, just before signing the agreement the parties orally agreed that if any additional medical procedures were required during surgery, they would be included in the $1,000 fee. The plastic surgeon, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the plastic surgeon's office. She applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the actress to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the plastic surgeon noticed another growth on the actress's neck. As the plastic surgeon subsequently recalled, she informed the actress about the growth and recommended that it be removed as well. According to the plastic surgeon's account, the actress orally agreed to have the growth removed for an additional $500. The actress has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The plastic surgeon performed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the actress paid the plastic surgeon $1,000, but refused to pay any additional money for the removal of the second growth. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $500, the plastic surgeon brought suit against the actress to recover the additional fee. At trial, the plastic surgeon objected to the introduction of testimony regarding any oral agreement made before the written contract was signed. By the same token, the actress objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Will the plastic surgeon be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed?\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the plastic surgeon will be entitled to recover the additional $500, we need to analyze the legal implications of the oral agreements made before and during the written contract.\n\n1. **Prior Oral Agreement:**\n   - The plastic surgeon orally agreed to remove the growth on the actress's right cheek for $1,000.\n   - The actress orally agreed to have the growth on her neck removed for an additional $500.\n\n2. **Written Contract:**\n   - The written contract specifies that the plastic surgeon will remove the growth on the actress's right cheek for $1,000.\n\n3. **Duties and Obligations:**\n   - The plastic surgeon performed the surgery on the right cheek and removed the growth there.\n   - The actress refused to pay the additional $500 for the neck growth.\n\n4. **Knock-Out Rule:**\n   - The knock-out rule states that any oral agreement made before the written contract is binding unless it is inconsistent with the written contract.\n   - If the oral agreements contradict the written contract, the written contract prevails.\n\n5. **Fairness and Equity:**\n   - The oral agreements were made before the written contract was signed, and the written contract specifies the fee for the right cheek growth.\n   - The oral agreements were made in a situation where the written contract was not yet in place, and the oral agreements were not intended to be binding on the written contract.\n\n6. **Inference:**\n   - The oral agreements were made in a situation where the written contract was not yet in place, and the oral agreements were not intended to be binding on the written contract.\n   - The oral agreements were made in a situation where the written contract was not yet in place, and the oral agreements were not intended to be binding on the written contract.\n\nGiven these points, the oral agreements made before the written contract were not intended to be binding on the written contract. Therefore, the oral agreements are not enforceable under the knock-out rule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe plastic surgeon will not be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule."
