The unity of a subring is not necessarily the same as the unity of the ring. The unity of a subring is the multiplicative identity of the subring, which may or may not be the same as the unity of the ring.\n\nStatement 2: Every field is an integral domain.\n- This statement is true. Every field is indeed an integral domain. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Since every field has a unity (the multiplicative identity), it automatically satisfies the condition of being an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
