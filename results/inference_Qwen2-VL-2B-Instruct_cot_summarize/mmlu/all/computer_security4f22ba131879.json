It is not directly related to timing attacks and does not affect the timing channel.\n\n2. **Montgomery Representation (MR)**: This is a method for performing modular multiplication in a way that reduces the number of multiplications required. It is not directly related to timing attacks and does not affect the timing channel.\n\n3. **Karatsuba Multiplication (KM)**: This is a method for performing multiplication that reduces the number of multiplications required. It is not directly related to timing attacks and does not affect the timing channel.\n\n4. **Repeated squaring and Sliding windows (RS)**: This is a method for reducing the number of multiplications required in multiplication and squaring operations. It is directly related to timing attacks and would close the timing channel if turned off.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. False, True**"
