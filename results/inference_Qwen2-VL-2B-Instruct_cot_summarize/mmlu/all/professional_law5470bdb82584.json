She parked in the store's parking lot, and while walking toward the building two masked males assaulted and raped her. The lot was poorly lit, had no security personnel, and was frequented by gang members. The police had several incident reports in the past 12 months documenting prior criminal activities, including some personal robberies and assaults, in the lot. The store itself had even more reports than the police. The woman sued the store for her injuries, claiming that it breached its duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers. Will she likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.\nB. No, the store owes no special duty of care to eliminate crime on the parking lot; it was up to the police to perform that task.\nC. No, the occurrence of a rape of a customer was not a foreseeable event and the store had no duty to try and discover that such a potential danger could exist.\nD. Yes, a store owner is the guarantor to every customer that he or she will be protected and safe when walking in the parking lot.\n"

Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.\n\nThe woman's case likely involves a breach of duty of care by the store, which is a legal concept that requires businesses to take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of their customers. The store's duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers includes ensuring that the parking lot is adequately lit, has security personnel, and is not frequented by known criminal elements. If the store knew or should have known about the presence of gang members and other criminal activities in the parking lot, it would be liable for the assault and rape that occurred there."
