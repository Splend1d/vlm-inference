While the thief was exiting with a sack of chickens, the homeowner got his hunting rifle and shot him dead. The authorities charged the homeowner with homicide. At the trial, he defended on the basis that he was in fear for his safety, and was legally authorized to use deadly force to defend his dwelling and person from the illegal threat. Is the defense to homicide valid under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, he was authorized to use deadly force where he reasonably believed that the thief had a gun and would harm him.\nB. No, because it is not reasonable to use deadly force to prevent the theft of the chickens.\nC. No, because a homeowner can never legally use deadly force to stop a theft.\nD. Yes, because a dwelling owner can always use deadly force to protect his property and person from an illegal trespasser or thief.\n"

The homeowner's reasoning is flawed because he did not have a reasonable belief that the thief had a gun. The homeowner's belief was based on a visual observation of a gun, but this is not sufficient to justify the use of deadly force. The homeowner's belief was not reasonable because it was not supported by any evidence or information that would have led him to reasonably believe that the thief had a gun.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, he was authorized to use deadly force where he reasonably believed that the thief had a gun and would harm him."
