However, the context provided does not clearly indicate a specific defense mechanism. \n\nGiven the patient's history of being an honor student and excelling in sports and leadership positions, it is possible that she is using a defense mechanism that involves a projection of her own feelings or issues onto others. This could include projecting her own feelings of abandonment or anger onto her parents or other individuals in her life.\n\nTherefore, the most likely defense mechanism the patient is using is:\n\nC. Projection"
