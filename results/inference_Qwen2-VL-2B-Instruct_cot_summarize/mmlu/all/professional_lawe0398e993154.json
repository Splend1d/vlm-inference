He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of\n\nA. both indictments.\nB. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.\nC. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\nD. neither of the indictments.\n"

The federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\n\nDouble jeopardy is a legal principle that prevents a person from being tried twice for the same crime. In this case, the drug dealer was convicted of possession with intent to distribute narcotics in state court, and then was indicted for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine in both state and federal courts. The drug dealer's attorney argued that the new indictments violated double jeopardy because they were based on the same crime (the sale of cocaine). The court ruled that the federal indictment did not violate double jeopardy because it was based on a different crime (conspiracy to distribute narcotics), and the state indictment did not violate double jeopardy because it was based on the same crime (the sale of cocaine)."
