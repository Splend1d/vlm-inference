Differential changes in allele frequencies: Different populations within a species may evolve different versions of their genes due to natural selection or genetic drift.\n2. Reproductive isolation: These different versions of the gene pool can lead to reproductive isolation, where individuals from different populations cannot interbreed or reproduce with each other.\n3. Reproductive barriers: Reproductive isolation can lead to reproductive barriers, such as geographical barriers or physical barriers, that prevent individuals from different populations from interbreeding.\n4. New species: Over time, these reproductive barriers can lead to the formation of new species, as different populations evolve independently and become distinct from each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct summary of the process of allopatric speciation is:\n\nA. differential changes in allele frequencies \u2192 reproductive isolation \u2192 reproductive barriers \u2192 new species"
