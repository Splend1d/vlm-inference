The given number is 300.5849 gallons.\n\nRounding 300.5849 to the nearest hundredth means we look at the digit in the thousandths place, which is 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the digit in the hundredths place, which is 5, to 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of gas sold, rounded to the nearest hundredth, is 300.58 gallons.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 300.58."
