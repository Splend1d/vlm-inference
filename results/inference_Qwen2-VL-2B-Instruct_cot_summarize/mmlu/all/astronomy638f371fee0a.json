Metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.\n\nThe formation of the Earth and its planets is a complex process involving the condensation of gases and the accretion of solid material. The Earth's core is primarily composed of iron and nickel, which are the most abundant metals in the solar system. These metals condensed first in the early stages of the solar nebula, and as the planets formed, they accreted these metals and other materials to form the Earth's core. This process is known as the accretionary process."
