When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, \"Give it back!\" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.\nB. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.\nC. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.\nD. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the legal determination of whether the man's actions were sufficient to support a verdict of murder, particularly whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the mens rea (intent) required for murder.\n\n1. **Common Law of Homicide**: In jurisdictions following the common law of homicide, the standard for murder is the mens rea, which includes the intent to kill. The man's actions, as described, involved a threat of death and the discharge of a firearm, which is a clear indication of intent to kill.\n\n2. **Common Law of Felony Murder**: In some jurisdictions, the standard for murder is felony murder, which requires the defendant to have committed a felony (in this case, the theft of the computer) before the murder occurred. The evidence in this case does not support the felony murder standard.\n\n3. **Intent Analysis**: The man's actions were not intended to kill the friend but rather to take property from him under a claim of right. This is a different type of murder, known as \"depraved-heart murder,\" where the defendant's intent is to cause death or serious bodily harm, but the harm is not intended to be fatal.\n\n4. **Appellate Review**: The man's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict of murder is based on the common law of homicide, which requires the mens rea of intent to kill. The evidence in this case does not support the mens rea required for murder, particularly the intent to kill.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the man's conviction should not be reversed based on the evidence provided. The evidence does not support the mens rea required for murder, and the man's actions were not intended to kill the friend but rather to take property from him under a claim of right.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right."
