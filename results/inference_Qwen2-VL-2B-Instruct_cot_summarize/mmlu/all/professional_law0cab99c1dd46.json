The girlfriend, who was scared of flying, reluctantly agreed. During the flight, the pilot decided to play a practical joke and shut off the plane's engine. When the plane went into a nosedive, the pilot said, \"Oh my God, we're going to crash. \" The girlfriend became panic- stricken and started screaming hysterically. A few seconds later, the pilot re-started the engine and said, \"Don't worry \u0080\u0094I was only joking. \" The plane landed safely and neither person was injured. If the girlfriend brings suit against the pilot for intentional infliction of emotional distress, she will probably\n\nA. recover, because a reasonable person would have been distressed by the pilot's actions.\nB. recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. not recover, because the pilot intended his actions as a practical joke and, therefore, lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort.\nD. not recover, because the girlfriend did not suffer any physical injury.\n"

In this case, the pilot's actions were not intentional; he was playing a practical joke. Therefore, the girlfriend cannot recover for emotional distress caused by the pilot's actions."
