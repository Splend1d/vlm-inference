On appeal, he had a de novo trial before a county trial court. He presented medical testimony diagnosing the disease of alcoholism, which was marked by a nearly uncontrollable urge to drink. The defense claimed that a person could not be convicted for suffering from a disease process. The state simply argued that the man had no defense to what he did. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the man's appeal after his conviction. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because it is unconstitutional to punish someone for the status of being an alcoholic or a drug addict.\nB. Yes, because when a person acts under a compulsion that is part of a medical disease, this negates criminal intent.\nC. No, because the man was sane and knew the difference between right and wrong when he was sober.\nD. No, because he was convicted not for being a chronic alcoholic but for the actions of being in public while drunk.\n"

                    "text": "The Court is likely to reverse the conviction based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Crime**: The man was convicted under a criminal statute that prohibited public intoxication. This statute is designed to punish individuals who are drunk in public, not those who are suffering from a medical condition that makes them unable to control their behavior.\n\n2. **Nature of the Disease**: The man presented medical testimony diagnosing him with alcoholism, which is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to drink. This medical condition is not a crime in itself but rather a medical condition that makes the individual unable to control their behavior.\n\n3. **Nature of the Punishment**: The punishment of a fine and a weekend in jail is not for the nature of the disease but for the act of being drunk in public. The statute does not punish the disease itself but the act of being drunk.\n\nGiven these points, the Court is likely to find that the conviction is based on a statute that is unconstitutional because it punishes the act of being drunk in public, not the nature of the disease that makes the individual unable to control their behavior. Therefore, the Court is likely to reverse the conviction.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. Yes, because it is unconstitutional to punish someone for the status of being an alcoholic or a drug addict."
