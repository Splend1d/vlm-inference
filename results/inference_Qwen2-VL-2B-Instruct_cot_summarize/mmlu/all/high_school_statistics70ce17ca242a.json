Mean of X + Y:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_{X+Y} = \\mu_x + \\mu_y = 32 + 44 = 76\n   \\]\n\n2. Standard deviation of X + Y:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{X+Y} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_x^2 + \\sigma_y^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the mean and standard deviation of X + Y are 76 and 13, respectively. The correct answer is B."
