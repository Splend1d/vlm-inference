A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nWhich of the following explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must \"avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity\"?\n\nA. African nations will not achieve independence without unity.\nB. Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.\nC. The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.\nD. The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\n"

                    "text": "To determine why Kwame Nkrumah feels Africa must \"avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity,\" we need to analyze the context and the core message of the quote provided.\n\nThe quote discusses the importance of creating a political union in Africa to avoid the dangers of disunity. It highlights the need for a united African state to project the African personality effectively and command respect from the world. The quote also mentions the lack of attention to African opposition to French atomic tests in the Sahara and the U.N.'s inaction during the Congo crisis, which Nkrumah sees as evidence of the Great Powers' disregard for African Independence.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **African nations will not achieve independence without unity.**\n   - This option aligns with the quote's emphasis on the importance of unity in achieving African independence. It supports the idea that unity is crucial for achieving independence.\n\nB. **Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.**\n   - This option suggests that disunity was the cause of the current state of disarray in Africa. However, the quote does not explicitly state that disunity was the cause of the current state of disarray. It focuses more on the need for unity to avoid future dangers.\n\nC. **The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.**\n   - This option is not directly supported by the quote. The quote does not mention any specific experience of civil wars in Africa, nor does it discuss the continent's past experiences.\n\nD. **The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.**\n   - This option is somewhat relevant but does not fully capture the essence of the quote. The quote is more focused on the need for unity to avoid the dangers inherent in disunity, rather than the world community's perception of power.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the option that best explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must \"avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity\" is:\n\nA. African nations will not achieve independence without unity.\n\nFinal answer: A. African nations will not achieve independence without unity."
