A out- of-state farmer who is a U. S. citizen has contracted, subsequent to the aforementioned law, to purchase a farm from a landowner, which is located in the state. The landowner, who is a resident of the state, has been informed by his attorney that his sales agreement with the farmer is null and void under state law. Which of the following is the best constitutional argument to contest the validity of the state statute?\n\nA. The contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts.\nB. The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC.

The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2.\n\nThe privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that \"no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" This clause protects the rights of citizens of the United States, including the right to own property, which is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\n\nIn this case, the state statute in question restricts the right of a U.S. citizen to own agricultural land in the state, which is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. Therefore, the state statute is unconstitutional under the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2."
