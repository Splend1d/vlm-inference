They can't know this to be true without an anonymous survey.\n- This option suggests that the Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and the Education Center's finding is not credible because they did not conduct an anonymous survey. However, the argument does not rely on the survey's anonymity; it focuses on the absence of missteps, abuses, or coercive tendencies. The survey's anonymity is irrelevant to the argument's core point.\n\nB. Other studies have found contrary results.\n- This option implies that the Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and the Education Center's finding is not credible because other studies have found contrary results. However, the argument does not compare the findings of the Oregon study with other studies; it focuses on the absence of missteps, abuses, or coercive tendencies.\n\nC. Even if the finding is true, it is irrelevant to the moral status of euthanasia.\n- This option suggests that the finding is irrelevant because it is true. However, the argument does not claim that the finding is irrelevant; it claims that it is true and then argues against its moral status.\n\nD. The findings are suspect because the study was performed by advocates of euthanasia.\n- This option suggests that the study is suspect because it was performed by advocates of euthanasia. However, the argument does not claim that the study was performed by advocates of euthanasia; it focuses on the absence of missteps, abuses, or coercive tendencies.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. Even if the finding is true, it is irrelevant to the moral status of euthanasia.\n\nThe argument does not rely on the survey's anonymity; it focuses on the absence of missteps, abuses, or coercive tendencies."
