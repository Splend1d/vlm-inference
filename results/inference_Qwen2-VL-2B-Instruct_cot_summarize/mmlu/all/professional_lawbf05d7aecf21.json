City residents have recently complained that the surfers are creating a public nuisance by littering the beaches, harassing sunbathers, and injuring swimmers with their surfboards. As a consequence, the city adopted an ordinance prohibiting all surfing on its beaches. The newly enacted ordinance further prohibited the sale of surfboards within the city's limits. An out of state surfboard manufacturer had planned to sell a new line of fiberglass surfboards in the city in the upcoming year. This is now precluded by the recently adopted measure. If the manufacturer seeks to enjoin application of the city ordinance, which of the following is the WEAKEST defense for the city?\n\nA. There is no case or controversy.\nB. The manufacturer's case is moot.\nC. The manufacturer lacks standing.\nD. The case is not ripe.\n"

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Nature of the Case**: The city has adopted an ordinance prohibiting surfing on its beaches, and the manufacturer plans to sell surfboards in the city. The city seeks to enjoin the application of this ordinance.\n\n2. **Mootness**: The manufacturer argues that the case is moot because the ordinance has already been enacted and the manufacturer cannot sell surfboards in the city.\n\n3. **Standing**: The manufacturer argues that it lacks standing because it is not directly affected by the city's ordinance.\n\n4. **Ripeness**: The manufacturer argues that the case is not ripe because the ordinance has not yet been enforced.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **There is no case or controversy**: This option suggests that the case is not about a dispute or controversy. However, the city's ordinance is being challenged, so this option is not entirely accurate.\n\nB. **The manufacturer's case is moot**: This option is correct because the city's ordinance has already been enacted, and the manufacturer cannot sell surfboards in the city.\n\nC. **The manufacturer lacks standing**: This option is also correct because the manufacturer is not directly affected by the city's ordinance, as it is not a party to the case.\n\nD. **The case is not ripe**: This option is incorrect because the city's ordinance has already been enacted, and the manufacturer cannot challenge it.\n\nTherefore, the weakest defense for the city is:\n\n**B. The manufacturer's case is moot.**"
