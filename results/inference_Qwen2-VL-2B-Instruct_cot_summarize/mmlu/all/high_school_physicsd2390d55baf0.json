                    "text": "The ideal gas law states that the pressure of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the volume. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nP = k * T / V\n\nwhere P is the pressure, k is a constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and V is the volume in cubic meters.\n\nIf the temperature is increased by a factor of 2, the new temperature T' = 2T. If the volume is increased by a factor of 8, the new volume V' = 8V.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ideal gas law, we get:\n\nP' = k * T' / V' = k * (2T) / (8V) = k * (2/8) * T / V = k * (1/4) * T / V\n\nComparing this to the original pressure P, we see that P' = (1/4) * P.\n\nTherefore, the pressure P decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nThe correct answer is B. P decreases by a factor of 4."
