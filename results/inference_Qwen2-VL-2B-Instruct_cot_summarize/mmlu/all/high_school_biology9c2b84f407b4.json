Protons are actively pumped into the lysosome.\n\nThe information provided indicates that most enzymes in the lysosome are only active at a pH of 5, which is significantly lower than the normal pH of 7.2 of the cytosol. This suggests that the lysosome has an internal pH that is more acidic than the cytosol. The lysosome has a pH of about 5.0, which is lower than the normal pH of 7.2 of the cytosol. This is because the lysosome has a proton pump that actively pumps protons into the lysosome, creating an acidic environment inside the lysosome. This acidic environment is necessary for the enzymes in the lysosome to function properly."
