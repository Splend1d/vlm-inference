Rose only.\n\nThe equity method requires that an investor account for its investment in a subsidiary (Rose Co.) using the equity method if it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the subsidiary's operating and financial policies. Significant influence means that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the subsidiary's operating and financial policies, which is not the case with Goll Co. in this scenario. Therefore, Goll should account for its investment in Rose Co. using the equity method."
