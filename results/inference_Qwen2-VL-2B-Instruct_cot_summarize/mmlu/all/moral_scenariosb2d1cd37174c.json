This action was clearly against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involved a dangerous situation where the character's step-mother was in danger. \n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) painted their car a bright shade of purple. This action is generally considered to be a personal choice and does not involve any harm or wrongdoing. It is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
