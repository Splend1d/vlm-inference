Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe author of the above passage claims: \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.\" What does he mean by this?\n\nA. The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.\nB. The empire became too large to control effectively.\nC. Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine what the author of the passage means by \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest,\" we need to analyze the context and the core of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the decline of the Roman Empire, stating that prosperity (or growth) led to the decay of the empire. It mentions that the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest, implying that as the empire expanded, the number of causes for its downfall increased.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.**\n   - This option suggests that the rulers became too wealthy and thus fell, which is not the main point of the passage. The passage focuses on the causes of decay rather than the causes of the rulers' downfall.\n\nB. **The empire became too large to control effectively.**\n   - This option suggests that the empire became too large to manage, which is a plausible reason for decay. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the empire became too large to control effectively.\n\nC. **Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.**\n   - This option implies that decay starts as soon as something begins to grow, which is not the main point of the passage. The passage discusses the causes of decay rather than the causes of growth.\n\nD. **Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.**\n   - This option suggests that conquest and prosperity are incompatible, which is not the main point of the passage. The passage does not argue that conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most accurate interpretation of the author's claim is:\n\n**B. The empire became too large to control effectively.**\n\nThis option aligns with the passage's emphasis on the extent of conquest and the resulting inability to manage the empire effectively, leading to its downfall."
