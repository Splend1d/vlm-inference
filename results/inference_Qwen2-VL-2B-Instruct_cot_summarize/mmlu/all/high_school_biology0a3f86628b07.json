They also differ in that they release the nitrogen waste urea instead of ammonia. Which of the following statements correctly explains how this is an advantage for lungfish?\n\nA. Urea is insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom of the small pools. Thus the poisonous substance is isolated from the fish.\nB. Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools.\nC. Other fish in the small pools can use urea as an energy source.\nD. The highly toxic urea makes the pool uninhabitable to competitors.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct explanation for why African lungfish differ from other fish in that they release the nitrogen waste urea instead of ammonia, we need to consider the ecological benefits of this behavior.\n\n1. **Urea is insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom of the small pools.** This means that the poisonous substance (urea) is isolated from the fish, preventing it from being ingested by other fish or predators.\n\n2. **Urea is a natural byproduct of protein metabolism in the lungfish.** This means that the lungfish are able to produce urea as a waste product, which is a natural and efficient process for them.\n\n3. **Urea is not toxic to other fish or predators.** This is because urea is not a toxic substance; it is a natural waste product that the lungfish can safely release into the environment.\n\n4. **Urea is not harmful to the environment.** This is because it is not a toxic substance that would harm the aquatic ecosystem.\n\nGiven these points, the correct statement that explains why this is an advantage for lungfish is:\n\nA. Urea is insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom of the small pools. Thus the poisonous substance is isolated from the fish.\n\nThis option directly addresses the ecological benefit of isolating the poisonous substance from other fish and predators, which is a crucial advantage for lungfish in their small, stagnant freshwater pools."
