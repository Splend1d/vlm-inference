This action is generally considered to be a positive and supportive gesture, and it does not involve any clear moral wrongs. In Scenario 2, the main character rented out a run-down apartment to college students for more than it was worth, which is a morally wrong action. It is illegal to rent out property without proper authorization, and it is also unethical to charge more than the market value for the property."
