There are continuous nightly activities by the club, including loud music, unruly customers, throwing cans and bottles,urinating in public, shouting profanities, fist-fighting, and acts of vandalism. The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures. The club defends that it cannot control its customers after they leave the premises, and it reminds the court that it has zoning approval. Its approval, however, is based on a grandfather clause that allows it as a non-conforming use \u0080\u0093 otherwise, the area surrounding the club is strictly residential. Will the court likely issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbor's problems?\n\nA. No, the right of free speech granted to a strip club outweighs the minor and temporary inconvenience of the neighbors.\nB. Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous \u0080\u0093 an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.\nC. No, because there is no remedy for interference with use and enjoyment of land other than a tort action for trespass or to abate an abnormally dangerous condition.\nD. Yes, the activities of the club constitute an attractive nuisance that interferes with the public at large and must be abated.\n"

These activities are not necessarily harmful to the public but can be disruptive and offensive to the neighbors.\n\n2. **Interference with Use and Enjoyment:**\n   - The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures. The club's zoning approval is based on a grandfather clause, which allows it as a non-conforming use. This means that the club is allowed to operate in a manner that might be considered a nuisance by the neighbors.\n\n3. **Interference with Public Use:**\n   - The activities of the club can interfere with the public's use of the area. The club's presence and activities can create a public nuisance, which is a type of interference with public use.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to consider the activities of the club as a substantial and unreasonable interference with the public's use of the area. The court will likely issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbors' problems.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nB. Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous \u0080\u0093 an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance."
