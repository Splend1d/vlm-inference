For example, the WISC has a mean score of around 100 and a standard deviation of around 15. \n\nIf we assume that the distribution of scores is approximately normal, we can estimate that about 68% of the population would score between the mean and the standard deviation. Therefore, we can estimate that about 68% of the population scores between 70 and 130 on the WISC.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 68."
