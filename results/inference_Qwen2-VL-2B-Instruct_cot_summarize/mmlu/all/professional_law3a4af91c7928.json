In this case, the expert witness's testimony about the car's design safety is not relevant to the driver's guilt or innocence, but rather to the manufacturer's liability for the car's design. Therefore, the testimony does not qualify under the hearsay exception for former testimony.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Only if the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding: This is not relevant because the expert's testimony is not about the manufacturer's liability for the accident but about the car's design safety.\n\nB. Whether or not the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding: This is irrelevant because the expert's testimony is not about the manufacturer's liability for the accident but about the car's design safety.\n\nD. If the manufacturer had an opportunity to cross-examine the expert at the former proceeding: This is irrelevant because the expert's testimony is not about the manufacturer's liability for the accident but about the car's design safety."
