They dwell in the dark...\"\n- \"And upon the door and bolt, there lies dust.\"\n\n**Text 2:**\n- \"Truth is good and its worth is lasting.\"\n- \"It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator...\"\n- \"Whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.\"\n- \"It lies as a path in front of even him who knows nothing.\"\n- \"Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port...\"\n- \"Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.\"\n- \"Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.\"\n\n**Conclusion to be supported:**\n\nNow, let's analyze each option in the context of the texts:\n\n**Option A: Ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than ancient Sumerians.**\n- Text 1 describes the House of Darkness as a place where those who enter do not come out, and the darkness and dirt suggest a bleak and oppressive environment. Text 2 mentions the lasting worth of truth and the punishment for transgressing it.\n- While Text 1 does suggest a bleak afterlife, it does not explicitly state that it is less gloomy than Text 2's view of the afterlife. Text 2's emphasis on the lasting worth of truth and the consequences of transgressing it aligns more closely with a more gloomy view of the afterlife.\n\n**Option B: Ancient Egyptians were more inclined than ancient Sumerians to view political obedience as morally proper.**\n- Text 1 mentions the house where those who enter do not come out, suggesting a place of punishment or restriction. Text 2 discusses the punishment for transgressing the gods' ordinances, implying a moral code.\n- While Text 1 does imply a place of restriction, it does not explicitly state that it is more aligned with political obedience than Text 2's moral code.\n\n**Option C: Ancient Egyptians were more patriarchal in their gender relations than ancient Sumerians.**\n- Text 1 does not provide any information about gender relations or patriarchal structures.\n- Text 2 does not discuss gender relations or patriarchal structures.\n\n**Option D: Ancient Egyptians suffered under a more rigid social hierarchy than ancient Sumerians.**\n- Text 1 describes the House of Darkness as a place of restriction and punishment, suggesting a rigid social hierarchy.\n- Text 2 discusses the punishment for transgressing the gods' ordinances, implying a rigid moral code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion that best supports the given texts is:\n\n**D. Ancient Egyptians suffered under a more rigid social hierarchy than ancient Sumerians.**"
