When they got there, they saw a high-ticket group, apparently high-society people, attending an air history video. They took over the meeting room, waving their guns menacingly, and demanded their watches, wallets and jewelry. When they took inventory of their bounty, they found that the customers were actually from a university history club and that they had little real jewelry, watches or wallets, they became enraged and struck several of the participants, killing one and badly injuring another.

False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.\n\nThis is because the group of men at the fair were acting in a manner that was intended to cause harm to the customers, who were not present at the time of the crime. They were attempting to rob the customers and were found guilty of attempted robbery. Additionally, they were found guilty of false imprisonment, as they took over the meeting room and demanded their watches, wallets, and jewelry, which was a violation of their property rights. They were also found guilty of aggravated assault, as they struck several of the participants, causing serious bodily harm. Finally, they were found guilty of murder, as one person was killed and another was severely injured."
