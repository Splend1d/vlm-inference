Then in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. After the doctor failed to make his rental payments for the first two months of his lease, the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.\nB. the landlord, because he did not object to the assignments.\nC. the tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.\nD. the tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.\n"

The lease is between the landlord and the tenant, and the tenant is required to pay the rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. The lease contains provisions for the assignment of the leasehold interest, but the tenant did not assign the leasehold interest to the attorney. The tenant failed to make his rental payments for two months, and the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. The tenant's assignment of the leasehold interest to the attorney did not extinguish his obligation to pay rent, and the landlord is entitled to judgment for the unpaid rent. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments."
