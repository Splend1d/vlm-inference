Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust, an inspector tests a sample of units, calculating a mean of 9350 pounds with a z-score of -2.46 and a P-value of 0.0069. Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?\n\nA. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9350 pounds.\nB. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.\nC. 0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds.\nD. There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.\n"

A z-score of -2.46 indicates that the sample mean is 2.46 standard deviations below the mean of the population.\n\nGiven that the mean of the population is 9500 pounds, we can calculate the standard deviation of the population using the formula:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{\\text{Mean}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{9500}{9500} = 1 \\]\n\nThe z-score of -2.46 corresponds to a value of -2.46 in the standard normal distribution table. The z-score of -2.46 is approximately -2.46, which is less than -2.46.\n\nThe P-value of 0.0069 is less than 0.05, which is the significance level for a two-tailed test. This means that the observed difference in the sample mean (9350 pounds) is statistically significant.\n\nGiven that the z-score is negative and the P-value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that the mean thrust of the sample is significantly lower than the mean of the population.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is:\n\n**D. There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.**"
