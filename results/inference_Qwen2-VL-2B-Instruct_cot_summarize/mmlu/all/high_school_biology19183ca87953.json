Homology refers to the similarity in structure or function between different organisms or proteins.\n\nGiven the sequence of amino acids in hemoglobin molecules, it is more similar to the hemoglobin of chimpanzees than it is to the hemoglobin of dogs. This similarity suggests that:\n\nThe sequence of amino acids in hemoglobin molecules is more similar to the sequence of amino acids in the hemoglobin of chimpanzees than it is to the sequence of amino acids in the hemoglobin of dogs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. humans and chimpanzees are more closely related than humans and dogs"
