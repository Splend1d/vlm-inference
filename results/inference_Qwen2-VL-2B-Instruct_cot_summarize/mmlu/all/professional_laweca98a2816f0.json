Annoyed by the taunts, the player started an argument with the umpire. When the umpire told the player to be quiet and go back to his team's bench, the player became enraged and savagely attacked the umpire, hitting him in the head with a bat. The spectator who had taunted the player was overcome by humiliation and horror at what occurred, because he was a good friend of the umpire. The spectator suffered no physical injury, but experienced severe nervous shock and brooded over the incident for months. If the spectator asserts an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the baseball player, the spectator will\n\nA. win, because the player's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nB. win, because he was present and witnessed the attack.\nC. lose, because he was partly responsible for causing the attack to occur.\nD. lose, because the umpire was not an immediate family member of the spectator.\n"

The key factors in determining whether an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is successful are:\n\n1. **Extreme and outrageous conduct**: The spectator must show that the baseball player's conduct was so extreme and outrageous that it caused the spectator significant emotional distress.\n\n2. **Witnessing the attack**: The spectator must have witnessed the attack and been present at the scene when it occurred.\n\n3. **Participation in the attack**: The spectator must have participated in the attack, either directly or indirectly, in order to be considered a party to the conduct that caused emotional distress.\n\nIn this case, the spectator was a spectator who was present at the game and witnessed the attack. However, the spectator did not participate in the attack. The spectator's emotional distress was caused by the taunting and subsequent attack, but the spectator did not physically participate in the attack. Therefore, the spectator cannot be considered a party to the conduct that caused emotional distress.\n\nThe spectator's emotional distress was caused by the taunting and subsequent attack, but the spectator did not physically participate in the attack. Therefore, the spectator cannot be considered a party to the conduct that caused emotional distress. Consequently, the spectator will lose the action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. lose, because the umpire was not an immediate family member of the spectator."
