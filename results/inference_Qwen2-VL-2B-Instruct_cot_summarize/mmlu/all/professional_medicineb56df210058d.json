He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues\n"

Glycogenolysis in the liver\n\nThis is because the man's glucose concentration remains within the reference range after consuming an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates, and then sleeping through the night without additional food or drink. Glycogenolysis in the liver is a process where glucose is released from glycogen stores, which can help maintain blood glucose levels during fasting or low-calorie diets."
