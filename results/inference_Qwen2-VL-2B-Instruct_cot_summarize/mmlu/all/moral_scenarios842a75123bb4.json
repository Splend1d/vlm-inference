This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves the addition of a substance that is not necessary for the flavor of the coffee, and it can be seen as a waste of resources. In Scenario 2, the main character brought out their phone and recorded the dressing room. This action is generally considered morally neutral because it is a private and personal matter, and it does not involve any harm or harm to others."
