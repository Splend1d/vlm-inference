This is a common and legal activity, and it does not involve any actions that are inherently wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is bringing their deceased dog to the taxidermist to be preserved. This action is generally considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020. Taxidermy is a practice that involves the preservation of dead animals, and it is often seen as a form of animal exploitation and cruelty. It is generally considered unethical and morally wrong to bring a deceased animal to be preserved in this manner."
