                    "text": "A women's action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men's club to admit women to membership. The women's group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men's club was subject to the state's anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women's group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men's club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor's office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don't vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney's office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor's official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney's suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\n\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\nB. there is no case or controversy.\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\nD. the women's group lacks standing.\n"

The women's group lacks standing.\n\nThe court will likely deny the declaratory judgment request because the women's group lacks standing to bring the suit. The court will likely find that the women's group lacks the legal standing to bring a declaratory judgment action, as they are not parties to the suit and do not have a direct interest in the outcome."
