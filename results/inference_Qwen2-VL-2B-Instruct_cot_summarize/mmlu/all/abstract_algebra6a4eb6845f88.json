                    "text": "Statement 1 is false. The degree of a polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the highest power of the variable \\( x \\) in the polynomial. Therefore, if \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are in a ring \\( R[x] \\), the degree of their sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is not necessarily the maximum of their individual degrees. For example, if \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) and \\( g(x) = x \\), then \\( f(x) + g(x) = x^3 \\), which has a degree of 3, whereas \\( f(x) \\) has a degree of 2 and \\( g(x) \\) has a degree of 1. Thus, the degree of the sum is not necessarily the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n\nStatement 2 is true. A field \\( F \\) is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain properties, including the existence of multiplicative inverses. If \\( F \\) is a field, then every ideal of \\( F[x] \\) is indeed principal. This is because the principal ideal theorem states that every ideal in a polynomial ring over a field is principal, meaning it can be generated by a single polynomial. This is a consequence of the fact that the field operations are well-behaved and satisfy the necessary conditions for principal ideals to exist.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
