This action aligns with the gang member's intention to rob the pedestrian.\n3. **The Pedestrian's Runaway**: The pedestrian's action of running away indicates that the gang member's intention to rob the pedestrian was successful, and the gang leader's action of keeping the watch in his pocket confirms that the gang member's intention to rob the pedestrian was successful.\n\nTherefore, the gang leader committed the crime of receiving stolen property, which is the act of keeping property that was stolen from someone else."
