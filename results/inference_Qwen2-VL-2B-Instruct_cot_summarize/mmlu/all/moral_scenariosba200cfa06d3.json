This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves calling emergency services for a non-emergency situation, which is generally not appropriate and can be seen as a form of interference or disturbance.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) walked into church wearing their birthday suit. This action is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is a personal choice and does not involve any harm or interference with others."
