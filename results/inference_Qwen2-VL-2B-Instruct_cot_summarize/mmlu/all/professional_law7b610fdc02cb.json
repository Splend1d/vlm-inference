The state law, however, does permit illegitimate children to inherit from and through their mothers. A man died intestate, leaving neither spouse nor any children other than an illegitimate son. The man's wife and his daughter died one year later in a motor vehicle accident. The illegitimate son filed suit in an appropriate court alleging that the state statute, which bars an illegitimate child from sharing in his father's estate is invalid, and that he should be declared the lawful heir of the man's estate. In challenging the validity of the state statute, will the illegitimate son prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because most state laws that discriminate against illegitimate children have been invalidated to ensure that a state's concern over illicit relationships is not the basis for punitive measures against the product of such a relationship.\nB. Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need.\nC. No, because a state may promote the just and expeditious disposition of property at death by denying intestate succession to all illegitimate children.\nD. No, because discrimination against illegitimate children is not suspect and, therefore, the law does not violate the equal protection clause if it is substantially related to a legitimate state interest.\n"

Yes, because most state laws that discriminate against illegitimate children have been invalidated to ensure that a state's concern over illicit relationships is not the basis for punitive measures against the product of such a relationship.\n- This option suggests that the state's concern over illegitimate relationships is the basis for discriminatory laws. However, the problem does not mention any discriminatory intent or punitive measures. The focus is on the constitutionality of the state statute, not on the discriminatory intent behind it.\n\nB. Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need.\n- This option suggests that the state statute violates due process by depriving the illegitimate son of his inheritance without a compelling state need. However, the problem does not discuss due process or the state's need for the statute.\n\nC. No, because a state may promote the just and expeditious disposition of property at death by denying intestate succession to all illegitimate children.\n- This option suggests that the state statute is invalid because it denies intestate succession to all illegitimate children. However, the problem does not discuss the state's need for intestate succession or the just and expeditious disposition of property.\n\nD. No, because discrimination against illegitimate children is not suspect and, therefore, the law does not violate the equal protection clause if it is substantially related to a legitimate state interest.\n- This option suggests that the state statute is invalid because it discriminates against illegitimate children. However, the problem does not discuss the constitutionality of the state statute in relation to the equal protection clause.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most relevant and accurate option is:\n\nB. Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
