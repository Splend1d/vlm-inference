The internal energy of a gas is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{PV}{T} \\]\n\nwhere \\( U \\) is the internal energy, \\( P \\) is the pressure, \\( V \\) is the volume, and \\( T \\) is the temperature.\n\nFor an expansion-compression cycle, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy:\n\n\\[ W = \\Delta U = \\frac{PV}{T} \\]\n\nGiven that the work done is 300 J, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 300 = \\frac{PV}{T} \\]\n\nWe need to find the heat transfer, which is the negative of the change in internal energy:\n\n\\[ \\Delta U = -W = -300 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ -300 = \\frac{PV}{T} \\]\n\\[ -300 = PV \\]\n\\[ PV = 300 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the temperature \\( T \\) using the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{PV}{300} \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{300 \\times 300}{300} \\]\n\\[ T = 300 \\]\n\nSo, the temperature \\( T \\) is 300 K.
