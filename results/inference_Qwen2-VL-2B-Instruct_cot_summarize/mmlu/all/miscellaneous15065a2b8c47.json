This activity helps students understand that numbers can be broken down into their place values, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics. By decomposing numbers, students can better grasp the magnitude of numbers and how they relate to each other, which is crucial for understanding place value and comparing quantities. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Decomposing quantities"
