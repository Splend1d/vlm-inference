While new members were pledging the fraternity, the student had a reputation for initiating pranks and hazing the pledges. Late one night, after a fraternity party, the student decided to kidnap one of the pledges. Enlisting the help of his friend, they grabbed the pledge, tied him up, and locked him in the trunk of the student's car. They then drove into the downtown section of a city where they dropped the pledge at a street corner. While the pledge was wandering around and trying to find a telephone booth, a gang of youths saw his predicament and attacked him. The pledge, who was severely beaten, suffered a broken nose, multiple lacerations, and contusions. When the pledge finally returned to the school, he filed a criminal complaint against the student who was charged with violating a state law, which provides:\"Every person who hazes a student and thereby is responsible for causing bodily harm to said student is guilty of a felony punishable by three years in prison. \"At thai, the prosecuting attorney called the student's alleged accomplice as a witness. The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt. After the friend left the witness stand, the prosecutor offered into evidence a transcript of the friend's testimony given at the student's preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student were responsible for hazing the pledge and driving the victim against his will to the city. During the preliminary hearing, the friend was also cross-examined by the student's defense counsel. Over defense objections, the trial court admitted the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing. Thereafter, the student was convicted of violating the aforementioned hazing statute. The student appeals the conviction and contends that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. As to this claim, the student's appeal will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.\nB. granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable.\nC. denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing.\nD. denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\n"

This testimony was not a statement by a co-conspirator but rather a statement made by the friend during the preliminary hearing. The friend was not a co-conspirator in the hazing of the pledge, so his testimony was admissible under the hearsay exception.\n\n2. **Hearsay Exception**: The hearsay exception allows statements made during a preliminary hearing to be admitted into evidence if they are made during the hearing and are not hearsay. The friend's testimony was given during the preliminary hearing, and it was not hearsay because it was made during the hearing.\n\n3. **Cross-Examination**: The student's defense counsel cross-examined the friend under oath, which is a standard procedure in criminal trials. The friend's testimony was not excluded because he was not unavailable, and there was ample opportunity for cross-examination.\n\nTherefore, the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing did not violate the student's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The appeal will most likely be denied."
