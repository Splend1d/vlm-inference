While properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census is the only way of establishing such a relationship.\n- This statement is incorrect. While a complete census is important for establishing cause-and-effect relationships, it is not the only way. Properly designed experiments can also strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nB. If properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.\n- This statement is incorrect. Observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships, but they are not as strong as properly designed experiments. Properly designed experiments are more reliable and can establish cause-and-effect relationships more strongly.\n\nC. Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.\n- This statement is incorrect. Controlled experiments are typically conducted first to establish cause-and-effect relationships, not later. Observational studies are used to suggest potential causes before conducting experiments.\n\nD. A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size.\n- This statement is correct. Increasing the sample size in observational studies can help reduce bias and increase the strength of the causal inference.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the true statement is:\n\nD. A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size."
