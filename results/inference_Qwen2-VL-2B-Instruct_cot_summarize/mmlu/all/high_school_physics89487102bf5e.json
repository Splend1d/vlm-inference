The proton will be bent in a circular path.\n\nWhen a charged particle, such as a proton, enters a magnetic field, it experiences a force that causes it to follow a curved path. This is due to the Lorentz force, which is a consequence of the interaction between the particle and the magnetic field. The direction of the force is perpendicular to both the particle's velocity and the magnetic field, resulting in a circular path."
