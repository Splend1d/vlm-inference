In this case, the power of the test for Ha: p = 0.7 is 0.8, which means that the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false is 80%.\n\nA Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The probability of committing a Type I error is the complement of the power of the test. Therefore, the probability of committing a Type I error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.\n\nA Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The probability of committing a Type II error is the complement of the power of the test. Therefore, the probability of committing a Type II error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2."
