They were built of over 1 million granite bricks.\n- This statement is true. The walls of Great Zimbabwe are made of granite, and it is estimated that over 1 million granite bricks were used.\n\nB. They exhibit sophisticated masonry.\n- This statement is true. The walls of Great Zimbabwe are built using advanced masonry techniques, which include the use of stone blocks and mortar.\n\nC. They stood 40 feet tall in places.\n- This statement is true. The walls of Great Zimbabwe are known to have stood 40 feet tall in places.\n\nD. The mortar that holds them together was made from ground up ocean shells.\n- This statement is false. The walls of Great Zimbabwe were built using a mixture of stone blocks and mortar, not ground-up ocean shells. The mortar was made from a combination of lime, sand, and water.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is true of the walls of the central complex of Great Zimbabwe EXCEPT is:\n\nD. The mortar that holds them together was made from ground up ocean shells."
