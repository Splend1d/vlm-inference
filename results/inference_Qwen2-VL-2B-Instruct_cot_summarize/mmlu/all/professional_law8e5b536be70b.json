                    "text": "The defendant's appeal is based on the claim that the trial court should have acted on its own motion to strike the testimony of the police detective who testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence and refused to take a lie detector test. The defendant argues that this testimony violated his privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Plain Error: This option suggests that the trial court should have acted on its own motion to strike the testimony. However, the trial court did not act on its own motion to strike the testimony. The defendant's attorney did not object to the testimony, and the trial court did not strike the testimony.\n\nB. Plain Error: This option suggests that the trial court violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination by admitting the testimony. However, the defendant's attorney did not object to the testimony, and the trial court did not strike the testimony.\n\nC. Harmless Error: This option suggests that the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by not timely objecting. However, the defendant's attorney did object to the testimony, and the trial court did not strike the testimony.\n\nD. Harmless Error: This option suggests that the defendant's statements were admissions. However, the defendant's statements were not admissions; they were testimony given by a police detective.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Plain Error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nThe trial court did not act on its own motion to strike the testimony, and the defendant's attorney did not object to the testimony, so the trial court's action was not error."
