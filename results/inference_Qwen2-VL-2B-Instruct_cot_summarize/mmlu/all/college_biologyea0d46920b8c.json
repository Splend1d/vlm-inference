                    "text": "C. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n\nNet primary productivity (NPP) is the rate at which primary producers (plants) produce their own food. It is influenced by various factors, including temperature, water availability, and the availability of nutrients. In terrestrial ecosystems, NPP tends to increase toward the tropics because the availability of water and warm temperatures in these regions promote photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This is because plants require water and sunlight to carry out photosynthesis, and these resources are more abundant in the tropics."
