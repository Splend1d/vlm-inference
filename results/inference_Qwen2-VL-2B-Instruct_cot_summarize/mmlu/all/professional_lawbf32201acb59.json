The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. Is the son's ownership interest enforceable as against the two surviving sisters who say that they now own 100% of the property pursuant to the law of joint tenancies?\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the son's ownership interest is enforceable, we need to analyze the legal implications of the conveyance and the subsequent will.\n\n1. **Joint Tenancy**: The deed conveyed the property to the daughters \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.\" This means that each daughter has an undivided interest in the property, and the property is owned jointly by all three sisters. The right of survivorship ensures that the property will pass to the last survivor.\n\n2. **Conveyance of a One-Third Interest**: One of the sisters conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. This is a valid conveyance under the law of joint tenancy. The third party, upon her death, can pass the one-third interest to her son according to the will.\n\n3. **Will and Son's Interest**: The will bequeathed the one-third interest to the son. This is a valid testamentary disposition, and the son's ownership interest is enforceable as against the surviving sisters.\n\n4. **Joint Tenancy and Survivorship**: The surviving sisters claim that they now own 100% of the property pursuant to the law of joint tenancies. This claim is based on the joint tenancy and the right of survivorship, which means that each sister has an undivided interest in the property.\n\n**Conclusion**: The son's ownership interest is enforceable as against the surviving sisters who claim they now own 100% of the property pursuant to the law of joint tenancies. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son."
