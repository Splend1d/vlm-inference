Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South.\n- This option suggests that the legal decision had a negative impact on efforts to desegregate schools, leading to resistance from white individuals. This is consistent with the passage's conclusion that the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" has no place and that segregation is inherently unequal.\n\nB. The Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education led to increased enrollment in colleges and universities.\n- This option suggests that the decision had a positive effect on higher education, leading to increased enrollment. However, the passage does not mention any increase in college enrollment as a result of the decision.\n\nC. During the 1960s, increasing numbers of high school graduates rejected the notion that a college education was desirable.\n- This option suggests that the decision had a negative impact on the educational aspirations of high school graduates. However, the passage does not provide any information about the impact on the educational aspirations of high school graduates.\n\nD. In the twentieth century, jobs in advanced technical and medical industries generally require postgraduate degrees.\n- This option suggests that the decision had a positive effect on the job market. However, the passage does not provide any information about the impact on the job market.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best representation of an effect of the legal decision described in the passage is:\n\nA. Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South."
