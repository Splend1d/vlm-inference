The person walked 3 miles to the east, then turned north and walked 10 miles, then turned west and walked 6 miles, and finally turned south and walked 16 miles.\n\nThe east-west distance is 3 miles, the north-south distance is 10 miles, and the west-east distance is 6 miles. The distance from the starting point to the final point is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with these sides.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(3^2) + (10^2) + (6^2)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(9) + (100) + (36)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{145} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} \\approx 12.08 \\]\n\nTherefore, the person is approximately 12.08 miles from his starting point.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 12.8."
