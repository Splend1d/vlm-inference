The three propositions are:\n\n1. All A are B.\n2. Some A are C.\n3. Therefore, some C are B.\n\nIn a valid categorical syllogism, the first and third propositions must be true, and the second must be false. The requirement that each term must be used twice, no more and no less, is a way of ensuring that the argument is valid."
