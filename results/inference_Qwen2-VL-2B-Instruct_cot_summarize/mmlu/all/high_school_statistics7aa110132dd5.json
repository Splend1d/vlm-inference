This is consistent with the survey results showing 58% against annexation and the actual vote showing 56% against annexation.\n\nB. **It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.**\n   - This option implies that the difference is due to the nonrandom selection of respondents, which is not directly supported by the survey results. The survey results show a clear difference between the percentages, not a selection bias.\n\nC. **It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples.**\n   - This option suggests that the difference is due to the sampling method, which is not the case here. The survey results are from a single sample, and the vote is from a different sample.\n\nD. **It is the difference between the statistic and the truth due to use of a random sample.**\n   - This option implies that the difference is due to the random selection of respondents, which is not the case here. The survey results are not random, as they are based on a survey conducted by the local newspaper.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best description of the difference is:\n\n**A. It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.**"
