The cross-sections are squares, and the base of each square is a region bounded by \\(x^2 = 4y\\) and \\(y = 2\\).\n\nFirst, solve the equation \\(x^2 = 4y\\) for \\(x\\) to get the equation of the line parallel to the y-axis that intersects the region. This gives us \\(x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{y}\\).\n\nThe area of a square with side length \\(x\\) is \\(x^2\\). Therefore, the area of the cross-sections perpendicular to the y-axis is \\(x^2 = (\\pm 2\\sqrt{y})^2 = 4y\\).\n\nThe volume of the solid is the integral of the area of these cross-sections from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\):\n\n\\[V = \\int_{0}^{2} 4y \\, dy\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\int_{0}^{2} y \\, dy\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\left[ \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{2}\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\left( \\frac{2^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2} \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\left( 2 - 0 \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is 8, which corresponds to option A."
