The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nGiven:\n- Volume of the object = 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3\n- Weight of the object = 6 N\n\nThe buoyancy force (F_b) is given by:\n\\[ F_b = \\rho_{fluid} \\cdot g \\cdot V \\]\nwhere \\(\\rho_{fluid}\\) is the density of the fluid, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and \\(V\\) is the volume of the object.\n\nThe buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, which is equal to the weight of the object. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ F_b = W \\]\n\\[ \\rho_{fluid} \\cdot g \\cdot V = W \\]\n\nGiven that the weight of the object is 6 N, we can substitute \\(W = 6 N\\) into the equation:\n\\[ \\rho_{fluid} \\cdot g \\cdot V = 6 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_{fluid} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot V = 6 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_{fluid} \\cdot V = \\frac{6}{9.8} \\]\n\\[ \\rho_{fluid} \\cdot V = 0.62 \\]\n\nThe density of water (\\(\\rho_{fluid}\\)) is approximately 1000 kg/m^3. Therefore:\n\\[ 0.62 \\cdot 1000 = 62 \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the fluid displaced by the object is approximately 62 m^3.\n\nThe percentage of the object's volume above the surface of the water is:\n\\[ \\frac{V_{above}}{V_{total}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\frac{62}{2 \\times 10^{-3}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\frac{62}{0.0002} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ 31000 \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ 310000\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the object's volume above the surface of the water is approximately 310%, which corresponds to option D."
