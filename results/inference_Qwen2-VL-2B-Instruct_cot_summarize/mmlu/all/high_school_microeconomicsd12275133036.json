If the annual price of capital increases, the marginal cost curve will shift upward because the cost of capital increases. The average fixed cost curve will also shift upward because the fixed cost of capital increases. The average variable cost curve will shift upward because the variable cost of capital increases. The average total cost curve will shift upward because the total cost of capital increases. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
