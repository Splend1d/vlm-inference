This aligns with De Marneffe's view that paternalism is justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism.\"\n   - This option suggests that drug prohibition is paternalistic because its consequences are good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism. This is a more nuanced view, but it does not directly address the objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"Drug prohibition would be targeted to adults, and one can only be paternalistic toward children.\"\n   - This option suggests that drug prohibition is paternalistic because it targets adults, which is a more general statement rather than a specific response to the objection.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"Paternalism is always justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected.\"\n   - This option suggests that paternalism is always justified, regardless of the context. This is a broad and general statement that does not directly address the objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic.\n\nGiven the context and the specific objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic, the most appropriate response from De Marneffe would be:\n\n**Option A**: \"Drug prohibition would be done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drugs, so it is not paternalistic in an objectionable sense.\"\n\nThis option directly addresses the objection by emphasizing that drug prohibition is justified because it benefits others, not those who wish to produce or sell drugs."
