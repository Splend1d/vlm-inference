Muscle contains more water than fat\n\nBioelectrical impedance is a non-invasive technique used to measure body composition by measuring the electrical resistance of the body. The faster an electrical current travels through a tissue, the more water it contains. Muscle tissue contains more water than fat tissue, which means that muscle tissue will conduct the electrical current faster than fat tissue."
