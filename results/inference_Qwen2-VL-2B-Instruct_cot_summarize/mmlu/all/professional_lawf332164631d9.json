While standing in line at a concession stand, he got into an argument with three men ahead of him in the line. The three men were friends attending the game together. One of the men punched the sports fan in the mouth. A fight ensued. During the fracas, one of the other three men hit the sports fan over the head with a bottle, which caused him to suffer a serious concussion. The sports fan does not know for certain which of the three men struck him with the bottle. If the sports fan asserts a claim against the man who punched him in the mouth to recover damages for the head injury, will the sports fan prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth was the instigator who struck the first blow that started the fracas.\nB. Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth and the other men were acting in concert.\nC. No, because the man who punched him in the mouth did not actually strike the sports fan with the bottle.\nD. No, because the sports fan cannot offer proof as to which of the men struck the sports fan over the head with the bottle.\n"

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Instigator and Start of the Fracas**: The argument with the three men at the concession stand led to a fight, which escalated into a physical altercation. The man who punched the sports fan was the instigator who struck the first blow that started the fracas.\n\n2. **Concert of Action**: The other two men, who were friends attending the game together, were also involved in the fight. Their actions were part of the same concerted effort to start the fracas and to continue the fight.\n\n3. **Direct and Indirect Actions**: The man who punched the sports fan was the direct instigator of the fight, and the other two men were part of the same concerted effort to start and maintain the fight.\n\nGiven these points, the sports fan can assert a claim against the man who punched him in the mouth because he was the instigator who struck the first blow that started the fracas. The other two men were part of the same concerted effort to continue the fight, which is a necessary element of a claim for damages in a tort case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth was the instigator who struck the first blow that started the fracas."
