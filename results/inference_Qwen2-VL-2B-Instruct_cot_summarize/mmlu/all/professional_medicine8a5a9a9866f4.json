Migraine\n\nMigraine is a common type of headache that is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe, throbbing pain in the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and photophobia (fear of light). It is often triggered by factors such as stress, lack of sleep, or certain foods or medications. The patient described has a history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which are risk factors for migraines. The sudden onset of a severe occipital headache and stiff neck, along with the presence of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease, are also consistent with the symptoms of migraines."
