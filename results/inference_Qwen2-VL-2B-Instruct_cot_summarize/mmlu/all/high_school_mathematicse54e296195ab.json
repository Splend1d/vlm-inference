This implies that the function is concave up, which means that the function is increasing and the slope of the tangent line at any point on the graph is positive.\n\nGiven that we have the same number of subdivisions, we can use the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under the curve. The trapezoidal rule is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} \\approx \\frac{L + R}{2} \\cdot h \\]\n\nwhere \\(L\\) is the left sum, \\(R\\) is the right sum, and \\(h\\) is the width of each subinterval. Since the function is increasing and concave up, the left sum \\(L\\) will be less than the right sum \\(R\\), and the right sum \\(R\\) will be less than the trapezoidal sum \\(M\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the sums is:\n\n\\[ L \\leq R \\leq M \\leq T \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( L \\leq T \\leq M \\leq R \\)"
