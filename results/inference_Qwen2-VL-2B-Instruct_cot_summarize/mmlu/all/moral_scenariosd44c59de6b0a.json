Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did something clearly morally wrong by pulling the plug from their grandma's lamp to save electricity. This action is considered morally wrong because it involves taking away a valuable resource (electricity) from someone else without their consent or knowledge.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did not do anything clearly morally wrong. The character loosened their grip on the struggling elder while holding onto them, but they did not physically harm or take away anything from the elder. This action is considered morally neutral because it did not involve any harm or loss of value to the elder."
