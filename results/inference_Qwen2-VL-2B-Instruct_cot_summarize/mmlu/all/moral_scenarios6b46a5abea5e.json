In Scenario 1, the character took drugs all night to finish their thesis quicker, which is generally considered morally wrong. In Scenario 2, the character vandalized her car after interactions at home, which is also generally considered morally wrong. However, in both cases, the character's actions are not explicitly described as morally wrong, and the context does not provide enough information to determine the morality of their actions."
