It states that if the sky is blue, then there won't be rain. The conclusion is that there won't be rain.\n\n2. **Understand the structure of the argument:**\n   - The argument is structured as follows:\n     - Premise 1: If the sky is blue, then there won't be rain.\n     - Premise 2: The sky is blue today.\n     - Conclusion: Therefore, there won't be rain.\n\n3. **Analyze the type of logical reasoning:**\n   - The argument is a conditional statement, which is a type of logical reasoning where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\n4. **Evaluate each option:**\n   - **Option A:** This is a categorical syllogism, which is a type of logical reasoning where the conclusion is a generalization based on premises. The argument does not involve a categorical generalization.\n   - **Option B:** This is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of logical reasoning where the conclusion is a disjunction of the premises. The argument does not involve a disjunction of premises.\n   - **Option C:** This is a conditional syllogism, which is a type of logical reasoning where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The argument is a conditional statement.\n   - **Option D:** This is a conditional syllogism, which is a type of logical reasoning where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The argument is a conditional statement.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The argument is a formally valid conditional syllogism.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**D. It is a formally invalid conditional syllogism.**"
