Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum\nB. After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.\nC. The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption\nD. Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported\n"
