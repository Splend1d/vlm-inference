Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\n   - This statement is true. In horizontal microarchitecture, instructions are executed sequentially, requiring multiple time steps to complete. In contrast, vertical microarchitecture allows instructions to be executed concurrently, reducing the number of time steps required.\n\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\n   - This statement is false. Horizontal microinstructions are encoded, meaning they have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\n\nIII. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\n   - This statement is true. In horizontal microarchitecture, instructions are typically encoded with a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. III only"
