Critics challenged the constitutionality of this law in the Supreme Court on the grounds that it:\n\nB. undermined the intent of the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, which was added to the U.S. Constitution in 1807, prohibits states from returning a fugitive slave to the state from which he was taken. The Pennsylvania law, by prohibiting the taking, carrying away, or seducing of slaves from one part of the state to another, directly contradicted the intent of the fugitive slave clause. Therefore, the critics argued that the law was unconstitutional because it violated the intent of the fugitive slave clause."
