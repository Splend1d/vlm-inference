The atomic radius of a substance is the distance between the nucleus and the center of the atom.\n\nThe first ionization energy of carbon is 1086 kJ/mol, which means that it takes 1086 kJ/mol to remove an electron from the outermost shell of a carbon atom. This is a very high value, indicating that carbon is a very stable atom.\n\nThe atomic radius of carbon is 77 pm, which means that the distance between the nucleus and the center of the carbon atom is 77 pm. This is a very small value, indicating that carbon is a very small atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 70 pm, 1402 kJ/mol."
