The severity of the injury and the location of the damage will determine the extent of the effect on breathing. Some patients may experience difficulty breathing due to the injury, while others may have no significant effect on their breathing. It is important for healthcare providers to assess the patient's breathing and other vital signs to determine the extent of the injury and the appropriate treatment plan."
