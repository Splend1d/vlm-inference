                    "text": "Statement 1 is false. The derivative of the sigmoid function $\\sigma(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}$ with respect to $x$ is given by $\\frac{d}{dx} \\sigma(x) = -\\frac{1}{(1 + e^{-x})^2} \\cdot e^{-x} = -\\frac{e^{-x}}{(1 + e^{-x})^2}$. This is not equal to $\\text{Var}(B)$ where $B \\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))$, as $\\text{Var}(B)$ is the variance of the Bernoulli random variable $B$, which is $\\sigma^2(x)$, not $\\frac{e^{-x}}{(1 + e^{-x})^2}$.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Setting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 does not change the bias-variance trade-off. The bias-variance trade-off is influenced by the model's complexity and the distribution of the input data, not by the bias parameters in the network. Setting the bias parameters to 0 can lead to overfitting, but it does not change the bias-variance trade-off in the same way that changing the complexity of the model does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
