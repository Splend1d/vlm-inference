First, we need to find the multiplicative inverses of the elements in Z_5 and Z_9.\n\n2. In Z_5, the multiplicative inverses of 2 and 3 are 1 and 4 respectively.\n\n3. In Z_9, the multiplicative inverses of 3 and 5 are 1 and 4 respectively.\n\n4. Now, we can multiply the elements in the respective sets:\n\n   - (2,3) * (3,5) = (2*3, 2*5) = (6, 10)\n   - (2,3) * (3,4) = (2*3, 2*4) = (6, 8)\n   - (2,3) * (3,5) = (2*3, 2*5) = (6, 10)\n   - (2,3) * (3,4) = (2*3, 2*4) = (6, 8)\n\n5. Since we have two possible products, we need to check which one is correct.\n\n6. In Z_5, the multiplicative inverse of 6 is 1, and in Z_9, the multiplicative inverse of 10 is 1.\n\n7. Therefore, the correct product is (1,1).\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. (1,1)."
