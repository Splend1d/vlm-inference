A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n"

                    "text": "The question involves determining the legal rights and priorities of the parties involved in the use of a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the options provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Context and Relevant Law**: The context is a dispute over water rights in a stream that originates at the top of a mountain and flows down to a valley. The mountain is in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is using water for domestic purposes, while the millionaire is using water for agricultural purposes.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Option**:\n\n   - **Option A**: \"The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\"\n     - This option suggests that the rancher has superior rights because he is upstream. However, the stream is a non-navigable watercourse, and the rancher's domestic use is not necessarily superior to the millionaire's agricultural use. The period of prescription is 15 years, and the rancher's domestic use is ongoing.\n\n   - **Option B**: \"The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\"\n     - This option suggests that domestic use is superior to agricultural use. However, domestic use is ongoing, and agricultural use is not necessarily inferior. The period of prescription is 15 years, and the rancher's domestic use is ongoing.\n\n   - **Option C**: \"The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\"\n     - This option suggests that the millionaire has an easement by prescription. However, easements are typically granted by the government or by the owner of the land that the easement is on. The millionaire has not obtained an easement by prescription, and the stream is a non-navigable watercourse.\n\n   - **Option D**: \"The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\"\n     - This option suggests that the millionaire has continuously used the water and has put it to a beneficial use. However, the period of prescription is 15 years, and the rancher's domestic use is ongoing.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The most appropriate conclusion is that the millionaire has continuously used the water and has put it to a beneficial use, which is superior to the rancher's domestic use. Therefore, the millionaire should be awarded the water rights.\n\n**Final Answer**: D. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water."
