This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves physical harm without justification and is not necessary to achieve the desired outcome. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) sprayed their cat's fur with flea medicine. This action is not morally wrong, as it is a necessary and appropriate measure to protect the cat from fleas, which is a common and accepted practice in pet care."
