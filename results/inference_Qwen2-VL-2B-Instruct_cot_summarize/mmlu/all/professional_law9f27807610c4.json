She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective. The woman was forced to have a second surgery to replace the defective screws. If the woman asserts a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nB. prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.\nC. not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.\nD. not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.\n"

The doctor and the hospital are service providers, not product sellers, and therefore cannot be held liable for the defects in the screws if they were not part of the product they provided. The responsibility for the screws lies with the manufacturer or supplier of the screws, not the hospital or the doctor."
