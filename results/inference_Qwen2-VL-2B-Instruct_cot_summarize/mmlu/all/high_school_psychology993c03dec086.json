Rods and cones; bipolar cells; ganglion cells; optic nerve\n\nThis order accurately states the sequence of the transmission of visual information from the retina to the brain. The retina contains rods and cones, which are specialized cells that detect light and convert it into neural signals. These signals then pass through bipolar cells, which synapse with ganglion cells. The ganglion cells then transmit the signals to the optic nerve, which carries the visual information to the brain."
