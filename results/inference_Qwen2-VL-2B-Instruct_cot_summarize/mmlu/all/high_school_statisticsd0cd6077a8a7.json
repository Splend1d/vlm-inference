The interval is invalid because probabilities cannot be negative.\n   - This is incorrect because the interval is not negative; it is a range of values.\n\nB. The interval is invalid because it does not contain zero.\n   - This is incorrect because the interval does contain zero.\n\nC. Subaru owners are approximately 19.7% more satisfied with their drive systems than are Toyota owners.\n   - This is incorrect because the interval does not provide a percentage difference; it is a range of values.\n\nD. We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.\n   - This is correct because the interval is a range of values that is 90% confident that it contains the true difference in proportions.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\nD. We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116."
