This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves leaving potentially harmful substances in a place where children could be exposed to them. \n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character noticed a child drowning and continued on his evening walk. This action is not clearly morally wrong. While it may be considered a callous or irresponsible action, it is not necessarily morally wrong if the character's primary intention was to help the child and the situation was not immediately dangerous. However, it is important to note that this action could still be considered morally questionable, especially if the character's actions led to the child's death or if the situation was not immediately dangerous."
