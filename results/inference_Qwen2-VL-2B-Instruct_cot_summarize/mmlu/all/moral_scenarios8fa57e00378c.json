Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did something clearly morally wrong by showing pictures of chains and shackles and having the students skim a slave song. This action is considered morally wrong because it involves the use of images and language that are intended to evoke feelings of horror and disgust, which can be harmful to the students' mental health and understanding of history. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did not do anything clearly morally wrong. Ripping and tearing up test papers from a teacher is a form of vandalism and is generally considered morally wrong, but it is not necessarily harmful to the teacher's reputation or ability to teach."
