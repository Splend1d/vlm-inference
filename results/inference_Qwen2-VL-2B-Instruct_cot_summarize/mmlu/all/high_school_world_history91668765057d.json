Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same.

However, it also notes that the independence of Algeria was not achieved, and women's education was not improved. This suggests that the focus of revolutionary progressivism was not always on gender equality.\n\n2. **Observation B: Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution.**\n   - The passage does not provide any information about women's leadership roles during revolutions. It only discusses the lack of progress in women's education and the lack of change in general.\n\n3. **Observation C: Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them.**\n   - The passage does not provide any information about women's support for revolutions or their benefit from them. It only discusses the lack of progress in women's education and the lack of change in general.\n\n4. **Observation D: Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.**\n   - The passage mentions that the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen was written in 1791, which was a time of revolution and significant progress in women's rights. However, it also notes that the independence of Algeria was not achieved, and women's education was not improved. This suggests that revolutionary movements were not generally uninterested in women's rights.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best-supported observation is:\n\n**Observation A: Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.**"
