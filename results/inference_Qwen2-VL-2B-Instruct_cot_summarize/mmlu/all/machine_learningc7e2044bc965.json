In linear regression, the estimator is the least squares estimator, which is unbiased and has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n- This statement is false. AdaBoost, a popular boosting algorithm, assigns non-negative coefficients to the classifiers. However, it is not guaranteed that these coefficients will always be non-negative. AdaBoost can assign negative coefficients to some classifiers, depending on the specific algorithm and the data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
