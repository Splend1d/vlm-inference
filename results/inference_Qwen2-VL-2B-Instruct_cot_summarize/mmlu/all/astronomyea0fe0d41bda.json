The angular momentum of the comet is conserved, and the tail points away from the Sun because the Sun's gravitational force is always pointing towards the Sun. This is because the Sun's gravitational force is always pointing towards the Sun, and the comet's angular momentum is always pointing away from the Sun. Therefore, the tail points away from the Sun. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
