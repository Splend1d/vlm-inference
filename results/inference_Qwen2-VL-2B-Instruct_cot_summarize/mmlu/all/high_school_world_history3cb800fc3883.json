This is evident from the passage's exploration of the idea that meaning transcending the human condition is impossible, and the author's questioning of the meaning of life and existence. The passage also touches on the idea of the absurdity of human existence, which is a hallmark of modernist thought. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities"
