The statute contains express findings that, when combined, the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. These findings are supported by information presented to Congress during committee hearings on the legislation. A small dry cleaning store operates exclusively within a community in the center of a geographically large state. It has no customers from outside the state. It employs three workers, each of whom is paid less than the federal minimum wage. Must this dry cleaning store comply with the statute imposing the federal minimum wage requirements on all dry cleaning stores?\n\nA. No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.\nB. No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.\nD. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n"

                    "text": "The question involves understanding the implications of federal minimum wage requirements on a small dry cleaning store operating within a state. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Federal Minimum Wage Requirements**: The statute extends federal minimum wage requirements to all dry cleaning stores.\n2. **Substantial Impact on the National Economy and Interstate Commerce**: The statute includes findings that the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce.\n3. **Geographical Context**: The store operates exclusively within a community in the center of a geographically large state.\n4. **Business in State vs. Interstate Commerce**: The store does not have customers from outside the state.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.**\n   - This option suggests that the store's business does not involve interstate commerce, which is irrelevant to the statute's impact on interstate commerce. The statute's impact on interstate commerce is based on the store's business activities, not its location.\n\nB. **No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.**\n   - This option focuses on the impact of the store's wages on interstate commerce, which is not the primary concern. The statute's impact is on the substantial impact on the national economy and interstate commerce.\n\nC. **Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.**\n   - This option suggests that the statute's impact is due to the commerce clause, which is not the primary focus. The statute's impact is on the substantial impact on the national economy and interstate commerce.\n\nD. **Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.**\n   - This option aligns with the statute's findings that the wages have a substantial impact on the national economy and interstate commerce. The store's business within a state does not negate this impact.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.**"
