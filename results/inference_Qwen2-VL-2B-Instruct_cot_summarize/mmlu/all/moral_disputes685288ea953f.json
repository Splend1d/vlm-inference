They argue that this is a valid point and that it does not make sense to say that an embryo exercises higher mental capacities.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.\n- This option suggests that embryos do have higher mental capacities, which directly contradicts Lee and George's argument. They argue that embryos do not have higher mental capacities.\n\nB. It doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.\n- This option implies that saying an embryo exercises higher mental capacities is meaningless or invalid. This aligns with Lee and George's argument that saying an embryo exercises higher mental capacities is not valid.\n\nC. The argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.\n- This option suggests that the argument is valid but fails because it is based on a common logical fallacy. However, Lee and George's argument does not seem to rely on a common logical fallacy; rather, it focuses on the nature of mental capacities and the distinction between embryos and humans.\n\nD. To have killed a human embryos that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.\n- This option suggests a hypothetical scenario where killing embryos would be equivalent to killing a human. However, Lee and George's argument does not involve a hypothetical scenario but rather a direct comparison of mental capacities between embryos and humans.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best captures Lee and George's argument is:\n\nB. It doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
