Shampoo is not designed for cleaning dishes, and using it for this purpose is not only unethical but also potentially harmful to the dishes.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character turned on the ballgame when they sat down to watch TV, which is generally considered a morally wrong action. Watching sports while eating is considered disrespectful to the person who is eating, and it can be seen as a lack of consideration for their needs and comfort.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions."
