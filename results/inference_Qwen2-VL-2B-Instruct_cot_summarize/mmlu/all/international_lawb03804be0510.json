Presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned.\n\nThe meaning of implied authorisation is that when a State has been forewarned of an impending attack or threat, the Security Council is presumed to have approved the use of armed force to protect the State. This is based on the principle of collective security, which states that states have a collective responsibility to protect each other from aggression."
