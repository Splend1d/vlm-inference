According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, buying alcohol for someone under the age of 21 is generally considered morally wrong. This is because it violates the law and can have serious consequences for the individual and society as a whole.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is skateboarding really fast down the sidewalk outside the preschool. This behavior is generally considered to be morally wrong as well. Skateboarding at high speeds can be dangerous and can lead to accidents, which can result in harm to others or the skateboarder themselves. Additionally, skateboarding in a public place like a sidewalk outside a preschool can be disruptive and may not be appropriate for the environment.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
