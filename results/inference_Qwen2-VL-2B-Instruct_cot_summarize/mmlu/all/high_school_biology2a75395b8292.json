The two species share many proteins in common, and the nucleotide sequences that code for these proteins are almost identical.\n\nThis information would best help distinguish between an explanation based on homology versus one based on convergent evolution. Homology refers to the similarity of structures or functions between two species that are not the result of evolution, while convergent evolution refers to the similarity of structures or functions between two species that are the result of evolution. The fact that the two species share many proteins in common and have almost identical nucleotide sequences suggests that they may have evolved from a common ancestor, which is a hallmark of convergent evolution."
