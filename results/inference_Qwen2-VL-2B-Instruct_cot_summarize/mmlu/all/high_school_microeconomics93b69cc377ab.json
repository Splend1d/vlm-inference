The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will increase.\n\nThis is because the marginal product of labor (MP) is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor. If the MP of the 3rd worker is 10, hiring one more worker would increase the output by 10 units. Since the firm is selling its products for $3 each, hiring one more worker would increase the revenue by $30. Therefore, the marginal revenue per labor (MRPL) would increase by $30."
