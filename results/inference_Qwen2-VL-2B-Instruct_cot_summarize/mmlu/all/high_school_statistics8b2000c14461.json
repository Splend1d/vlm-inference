The first study is a controlled experiment, while the second is an observational study.\n\nIn the first study, the subjects were randomly assigned to either a meat-eating group or a vegetarian group, which allows for the controlled manipulation of the independent variable (eating meat products) and the observation of the dependent variable (weight level). This is a classic example of a controlled experiment.\n\nIn the second study, the subjects were randomly assigned to either a meat-eating group or a vegetarian group, but the independent variable (eating meat products) was not manipulated. Instead, the subjects were exposed to a controlled diet for 6 months, which is an observational study. The diet was controlled, but the subjects were not randomly assigned to the meat-eating or vegetarian groups, making it an observational study rather than a controlled experiment."
