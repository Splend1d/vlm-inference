This statement suggests that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all, implying that all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which the market operates. This aligns with liberal principles that prioritize free trade and international cooperation, as it suggests a shared interest in maintaining a stable global economic order.\n\nB. This statement highlights the potential for future disruptions in the global system due to energy scarcity and the emergence of a new international energy order characterized by statism and neo-mercantilism. While it acknowledges the potential for conflict over energy reserves, it does not explicitly align with liberal principles that prioritize free trade and international cooperation.\n\nC. This statement argues that oil remains the lifeblood of the current order and that those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favorable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system. This aligns with liberal principles that prioritize free trade and international cooperation, as it suggests a shared interest in maintaining a stable global economic order.\n\nD. This statement suggests that energy scarcity will signal a return to greater geopolitical confrontation and resource wars, presenting a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation and conflict over the control of major reserves. This aligns with liberal principles that prioritize free trade and international cooperation, as it suggests a shared interest in maintaining a stable global economic order.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that statements A, C, and D align with liberal principles that prioritize free trade, international cooperation, and maintaining a stable global economic order.
