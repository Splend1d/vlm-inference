Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nFrom the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore\n\nA. seems to mark a betrayal of a \"higher\" race by a \"lesser\" race.\nB. should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\nC. can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\nD. was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\n"

The passage discusses the Cawnpore massacres, which were a violent event in which British citizens were killed by Indian rebels. The key points are:\n\n1. The rebels were black men who killed British citizens.\n2. The rebels were seen as a race that dared to shed the blood of their masters and poor helpless ladies and children.\n3. The rebels were seen as a race that was fighting for their rights and revenge.\n4. The British were seen as a dominant race that had a monopoly on violence.\n5. The British were seen as a superior race that treated Indians as inferior and uncivilized.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"seems to mark a betrayal of a 'higher' race by a 'lesser' race.\"\n- This option suggests that the British were betraying their own race by killing their citizens. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the British were betraying themselves. It only mentions that the rebels were seen as a race that dared to kill British citizens.\n\nB. \"should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.\"\n- This option implies that the British should have avoided the massacres. However, the passage does not suggest that the British were regretful or avoidable. It only describes the rebels as a race that killed British citizens.\n\nC. \"can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\"\n- This option suggests that the British were responsible for the massacres. The passage does not explicitly state that the British were responsible for the massacres. It only describes the rebels as a race that killed British citizens.\n\nD. \"was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.\"\n- This option suggests that the British were seen as a religious duty to kill the rebels. The passage does not explicitly state that the British were seen as a religious duty. It only describes the rebels as a race that killed British citizens.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate interpretation of the passage is:\n\nC. \"can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.\"\n\nFinal answer: C."
