Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.\n\nThe cost of equipment used in research and development activities that will have alternative future uses should be capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life. This is because the equipment is expected to be used for multiple purposes, and depreciating it over its estimated useful life allows for a more accurate accounting of its cost over time. Expensing the equipment in the year in which it is used would not capture the full cost of the equipment, and capitalizing it and depreciating it over its useful life would provide a more accurate representation of the cost of the equipment."
