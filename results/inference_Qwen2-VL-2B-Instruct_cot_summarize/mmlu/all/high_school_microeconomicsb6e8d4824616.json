Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital.\n\nThis is because the marginal product of labor (MPL) is the change in output per unit change in labor, and the marginal product of capital (MPC) is the change in output per unit change in capital. The marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor (MPL/P) is the marginal product of labor per dollar of labor, and the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital (MPC/P) is the marginal product of capital per dollar of capital.\n\nTo find the least-cost combination of labor and capital, the firm should find the combination where the MPL/P = MPC/P. This will give the optimal combination of labor and capital that maximizes the firm's profit."
