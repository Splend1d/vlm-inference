He is approached by a graduate student, Marla M., age 36, who asks him if he\u2019d like to attend a baseball game on Friday night. Dr. Carlson is divorced and finds Marla to be a very attractive woman. In terms of ethical guidelines, if Dr. Carlson accepts Marla\u2019s invitation, he will be:\n\nA. clearly violating ethical guidelines.\nB. acting ethically since he is not the one who initiated a potential relationship.\nC. acting ethically as long as Marla is a student in a department other than the psychology department and will not be taking any classes in the psychology department.\nD. acting ethically as long as he does not become sexually involved with Marla until she is no longer affiliated with the university.\n"
