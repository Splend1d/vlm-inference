A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. Upon the rancher's death in 2010, his son, as his sole heir, brings an ejectment suit to recover possession of the property from the man. In his action, the son will most probably\n\nA. lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. win, because the statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder- man until his interest becomes possessory.\nC. win, because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year.\nD. win, because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.\n"

The man took possession of the land in 1978 and remained on the property until 1988, during which time he was an adverse possessor.\n2. The man left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year in 1990.\n3. The man's possession ended in 1990, and the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years.\n4. The man's possession ended in 1990, and the adverse possession period did not run against his interest until his interest became possessory in 1994.\n5. The man's interest became possessory in 1994, and the adverse possession period did not run against his interest until 2010.\n6. The statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder-man until his interest becomes possessory.\n\nTherefore, the man's possession ended in 1990, and the adverse possession period did not run against his interest until 2010. Since the adverse possession period did not run against his interest until 2010, the man has acquired title by adverse possession, and the son will most probably lose possession of the property in the ejectment suit."
