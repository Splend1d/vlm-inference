The neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor in title to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This access was desired even though the neighbor and his predecessor had other access to public roads. Recently, the woman erected a large solar collector on a portion of her land subject to the easement, even though the woman has other power resources. The location was essential to acquire the maximum sunlight. However, by erecting the collector there, the woman effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement. The local zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The neighbor immediately sued to compel the woman to remove the solar collector. Must the solar collector be removed?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources.\n"

Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\nThe key point here is that the easement was granted by the predecessor of the neighbor, and the neighbor's predecessor had other access to the public highway. The easement was intended for the neighbor's use, and the neighbor's predecessor had the right to use the easement for access to the public road. The woman's solar collector, while useful for acquiring sunlight, effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement for access to the public road. Therefore, the easement remains valid and the neighbor has the right to use it for access to the public road.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The neighbor has other means of access, but the easement is still valid.\nB. The zoning code permits the use of solar collectors, but the easement remains valid.\nD. The woman has other power resources, but the easement remains valid."
