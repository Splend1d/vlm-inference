Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge.\n\nPostcolonialism is a theoretical framework that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, primarily from the work of postcolonial scholars such as Edward W. Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dipesh Chakrabarty. It is a critical perspective that examines the ways in which the experiences of colonized peoples are shaped by the colonial experience, and how this experience intersects with the experiences of the colonizers themselves. Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge, as it has been developed and applied in various contexts and regions around the world, including the United States, Africa, Asia, and Latin America."
