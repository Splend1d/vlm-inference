The principle of utility states that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure. However, this principle is not a proven fact, and it is a unique problem for the theory because it is not possible to prove that the principle is always true or that it is always the best action to take. Instead, the principle is a guiding principle that guides ethical decision-making and is subject to interpretation and debate."
