The witness worked with the police a few days later to try and create a composite sketch of the purse snatcher. This was used by the police to capture the purported purse snatcher. The witness died several days before the trial. When the witness's drawing was offered by the prosecution as evidence at trial, is the trial judge likely to accept it as admissible evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because the police took it and used it to find someone, therefore it must be an accurate representation of the perpetrator; the exhibit must be admitted.\nB. Yes, because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent at a time close to the crime and it therefore has testimonial reliability.\nC. No, because the defense had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.\nD. No, because it was drawn up days after the event and is in violation of the best evidence rule.\n"

Yes, because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent at a time close to the crime and it therefore has testimonial reliability.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Evidence**: The witness's drawing is a written recollection of the perpetrator, which is a form of testimonial evidence. It is a written account of what the witness saw, which is considered reliable if it is in the nature of the recollection of the decedent at a time close to the crime.\n\n2. **Testimonial Reliability**: The drawing is considered testimonial because it is a written account of what the witness saw. It is not a physical object or a photograph, but rather a written document.\n\n3. **Witness's Death**: The witness died several days before the trial. However, the drawing was created and used by the police to create a composite sketch of the perpetrator. The drawing was not created by the witness but by the police, who used it to find the perpetrator.\n\n4. **Cross-Examination**: The defense had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death. However, the drawing was not created by the witness but by the police, and the witness's death occurred several days before the trial.\n\n5. **Best Evidence Rule**: The best evidence rule requires that evidence must be presented in the most direct and reliable manner possible. The drawing was created by the police and used by them to find the perpetrator, which means it was not presented in the most direct and reliable manner possible.\n\nTherefore, the drawing is admissible as testimonial evidence because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent at a time close to the crime, and it has testimonial reliability."
