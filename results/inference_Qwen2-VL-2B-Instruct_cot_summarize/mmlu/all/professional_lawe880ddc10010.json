As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\nB. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\nC. There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\nD. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n"

The purchasing agent negotiated a contract with the dressmaking company to purchase a specified quantity of khaki garments at a price of $75,000.\n2. One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price.\n3. The vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\n   - This option suggests that the mistake was due to a computational error, which is not necessarily a legal issue. The mistake could have been due to a simple arithmetic error, but it does not necessarily mean the contract was invalid.\n\nB. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\n   - This option suggests that the mistake was made by the dressmaking company, which is not necessarily the case. The mistake could have been made by the purchasing agent or another party, and the mistake itself does not necessarily mean the contract was invalid.\n\nC. There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\n   - This option suggests that the contract was not formed because there was no mutual agreement between the parties. However, the mistake made by the dressmaking company does not necessarily mean that the contract was invalid.\n\nD. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n   - This option suggests that the contract was voidable because the purchasing agent should have known of the error. This is the most accurate statement because the mistake made by the dressmaking company (an error in calculation) is a valid reason for the contract to be voidable.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is:\n\nD. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error."
