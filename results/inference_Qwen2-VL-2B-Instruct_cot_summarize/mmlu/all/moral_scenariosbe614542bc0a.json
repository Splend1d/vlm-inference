This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves a violation of the principle of honesty and integrity, which is a fundamental moral standard in the US as of 2020. Calling in sick to work is a way of avoiding work and potentially losing pay, which can be seen as a form of dishonesty.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character threw the baby to their friend, and the friend didn't catch it. This action is also generally considered morally wrong. Throwing a baby is a serious and potentially dangerous act, and it is not a morally acceptable way to handle a situation. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of others, and throwing a baby can have serious consequences.\n\nTherefore, the main character in scenario 1 is wrong, and the main character in scenario 2 is not wrong."
