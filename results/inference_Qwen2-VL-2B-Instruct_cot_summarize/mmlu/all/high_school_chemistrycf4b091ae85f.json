In this case, we have 0.150 M H3PO4 and 0.250 M KOH. Since the concentration of the acid is greater than the concentration of the base, the acid will completely neutralize the base.\n\nThe neutralization reaction is:\n\nH3PO4 + KOH \u2192 K3PO4 + H2O\n\nTo find the amount of KOH needed, we can use the formula:\n\nAmount of base = Concentration of base \u00d7 Volume of base\n\nIn this case, the concentration of KOH is 0.250 M and the volume of KOH is 50.0 mL. So, the amount of KOH needed is:\n\nAmount of KOH = 0.250 M \u00d7 50.0 mL = 12.5 mL\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 27 mL"
