D. degree at the state law school applied for one of the non-interest-bearing loans. Since he did not intend to seek U.

This classification is based on alienage, which is inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny. Therefore, the state statute is likely unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\nTherefore, the candidate will likely win the suit challenging the constitutionality of the state statute."
