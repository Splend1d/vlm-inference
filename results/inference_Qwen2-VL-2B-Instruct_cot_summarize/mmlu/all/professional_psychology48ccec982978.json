Six months after termination they meet at an art opening reception and begin to date. Over the next few months, the relationship progresses and they become sexual. In this situation, the psychologist has acted:\n\nA. Ethically because it had been 6 months since termination\nB. Probably ethically since there was no coercion involved and the relationship was consensual\nC. Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances\nD. Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment\n"

Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances.\n\nThe ethical considerations in this scenario revolve around the professional relationship and the consent of the client. The psychologist's relationship with the client after the termination of the therapy course is considered a violation of professional standards and ethical guidelines. The prohibition against sexual relationships with former clients is a fundamental principle in the field of psychology, as it is considered a conflict of interest and can undermine the trust and integrity of the therapeutic relationship."
