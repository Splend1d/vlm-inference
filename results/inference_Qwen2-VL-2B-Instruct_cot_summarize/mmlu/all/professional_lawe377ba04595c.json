Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)\n\nA. equitable servitude.\nB. restrictive covenant.\nC. unenforceable restriction.\nD. easement for public use.\n"
