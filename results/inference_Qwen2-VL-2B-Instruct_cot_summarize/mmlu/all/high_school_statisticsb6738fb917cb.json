The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.\n\nIncreasing the sample size from 200 to 2,000 will generally result in a more spread-out distribution of the sample proportion. This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the population proportion, leading to a more precise estimate of the proportion."
