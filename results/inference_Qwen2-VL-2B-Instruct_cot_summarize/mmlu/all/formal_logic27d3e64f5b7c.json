The statement \"No artifacts are people\" can be translated into predicate logic as follows:\n\nNo artifacts are people is equivalent to saying that for all \\( x \\), \\( x \\) is not an artifact.\n\nThis can be written in predicate logic as:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\, (x \\in \\text{people} \\rightarrow \\neg x \\in \\text{artifacts})\n\\]\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( \\neg \\text{Pa} \\)\n- This is the negation of \"Pa,\" which is not the correct translation of the given statement.\n\nB. \\( (\\forall x)(Ax \\rightarrow \\neg Px) \\)\n- This is the correct translation of the given statement. It states that for all \\( x \\), if \\( x \\) is an artifact, then \\( x \\) is not a person.\n\nC. \\( \\neg \\text{Ap} \\)\n- This is the negation of \"Ap,\" which is not the correct translation of the given statement.\n\nD. \\( (\\forall x)(Ax \\land \\neg Px) \\)\n- This is not the correct translation of the given statement.
