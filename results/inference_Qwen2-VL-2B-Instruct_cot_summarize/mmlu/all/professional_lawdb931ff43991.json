The judge's instruction to Defendant was\n\nA. proper, because a judge has broad discretion to instruct witnesses in such a manner.\nB. proper, because it would have the same effect as permitting cross-examination to continue after direct was concluded.\nC. improper, because it violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\nD. improper, because it violates the attorney-client privilege.\n"

The judge's instruction to Defendant not to speak with anyone during the night and to schedule cross-examination in the morning is a violation of this right. It effectively prevents the defendant from being able to effectively cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses during the night, which is a critical aspect of a fair trial."
