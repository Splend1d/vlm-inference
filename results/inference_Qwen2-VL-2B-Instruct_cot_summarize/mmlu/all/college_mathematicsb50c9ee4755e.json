The origin is at \\((0, 0)\\), so we want to find the point on the curve that is closest to the origin.\n\nThe distance \\(d\\) from a point \\((x, y)\\) on the curve \\(xy = 8\\) to the origin \\((0, 0)\\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y = \\frac{8}{x}\\) into the distance formula, we get:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left(\\frac{8}{x}\\right)^2}\\]\n\nTo minimize this distance, we can take the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx} \\left(x^2 + \\frac{64}{x^2}\\right) = 0\\]\n\nSolving this equation gives:\n\n\\[2x - \\frac{64}{x^2} = 0\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\(x^2\\) to clear the denominator:\n\n\\[2x^3 - 64 = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[2x^3 = 64\\]\n\n\\[x^3 = 32\\]\n\n\\[x = 2\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 2\\) back into the equation \\(y = \\frac{8}{x}\\) to find \\(y\\):\n\n\\[y = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\\]\n\nSo, the point on the curve \\(xy = 8\\) closest to the origin is \\((2, 4)\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the distance from this point to the origin:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (4)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 16} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\\]\n\nThe shortest distance from the curve \\(xy = 8\\) to the origin is \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\), which is approximately \\(2 \\times 2.236 = 4.472\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4"
