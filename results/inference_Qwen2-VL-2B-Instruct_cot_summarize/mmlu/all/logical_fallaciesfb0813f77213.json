A formally valid syllogism must be materially true.\n\nA formally valid syllogism is a valid argument structure that consists of three propositions (p, q, and r) connected by \"and\" and \"if-then\" statements. The syllogism is valid if the conclusion (r) logically follows from the premises (p and q). However, it is not necessarily true that the conclusion must be true in the real world. For example, a syllogism might be valid but the conclusion might be false. Therefore, option B is not true."
