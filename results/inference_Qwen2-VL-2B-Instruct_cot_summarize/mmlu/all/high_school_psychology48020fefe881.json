However, the discussion within each group is likely to lead to more nuanced positions, potentially making it more difficult for both groups to remain completely opposed to the death penalty.\n\nB. **Group A members would moderate their positions, but Group B members would retain their original positions:**\n   - This option suggests that Group A members would become more moderate, while Group B members would retain their original positions. This is consistent with the idea that the discussion would lead to more nuanced positions, potentially making it more difficult for Group B members to maintain their original positions.\n\nC. **Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions:**\n   - This option suggests that Group A would become more entrenched in their opposition to the death penalty, while Group B would moderate their positions.
