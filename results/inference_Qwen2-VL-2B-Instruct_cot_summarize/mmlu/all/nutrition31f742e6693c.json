Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it.\n\nAgricultural research can help reduce hunger and poverty by addressing the specific needs of poor farmers and consumers. This research can help improve agricultural practices, increase crop yields, and provide access to affordable food. By focusing on the problems of poor farmers and consumers, research can help create sustainable solutions that benefit both the environment and the economy. Public investment in agricultural research is necessary to support this type of research and ensure that it is accessible to all farmers and consumers."
