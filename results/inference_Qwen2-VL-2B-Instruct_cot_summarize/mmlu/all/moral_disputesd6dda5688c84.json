All of the above.\n\nShapiro discusses the Mediterranean cultures' use of alcohol to show that:\n\nA. even cultures with very low levels of alcohol consumption can have comparatively high levels of alcoholism.\nB. the consumption of alcoholic beverages (e.g., wine) can have surprising health benefits.\nC. increased use of a drug does not always lead to increased addiction.\n\nThese points are all supported by the discussion in Shapiro's paper. The Mediterranean diet, which includes wine, has been shown to have health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and some forms of cancer. Additionally, the consumption of alcohol in moderation can have positive effects on health, such as reduced risk of heart disease and some forms of cancer. Finally, the discussion does not imply that increased use of a drug necessarily leads to increased addiction, but rather that the relationship between drug use and addiction is not always straightforward."
