This is because the regression analysis is designed to test for the presence of systematic risk, which is the difference between the expected return of a portfolio and the risk-free rate. If a significant number of firms are able to outperform the market, it could indicate that there is some systematic risk that is not being captured by the market model.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this is a preliminary finding and further research would be needed to draw a more definitive conclusion about market efficiency. Additionally, the sample size of 100 firms is relatively small, and it is possible that the results could be due to chance. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that there is prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency based on this single finding."
