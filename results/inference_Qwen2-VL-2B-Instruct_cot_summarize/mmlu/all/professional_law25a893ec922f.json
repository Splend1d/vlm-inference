                    "text": "The civic auditorium is owned by the city. The auditorium is rented out to various organizations throughout the year. With a seating capacity of 1,500, it is customarily leased for rock concerts, rodeos, sporting events, fashion shows, etc. In January, a rock star held a week-long concert there, drawing a full house each night. Generally, the city leases the auditorium's facilities for a charge of $2,000 per day. In February, a religious sect applied to rent the auditorium for its annual celebration. However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a \"closed door\" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.\nD. Yes, because a city ordinance is not a state action, per Se, and, therefore, is not subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the constitutionality of a city ordinance that prohibits the rental of the civic auditorium to any religious group. The key points to consider are whether the ordinance discriminates against religious groups and whether it violates their due process rights.\n\n1. **Discrimination and Due Process**: The ordinance prohibits the rental of the auditorium to any religious group, which suggests that it discriminates against religious groups. The denial of the religious sect's application for the auditorium is a significant violation of their due process rights, as they were denied the opportunity to present their case and argue their case before the city council.\n\n2. **Application of the Fourteenth Amendment**: The Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" This amendment applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nGiven that the ordinance discriminates against religious groups and violates their due process rights, it is likely that the ordinance is unconstitutional.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing."
