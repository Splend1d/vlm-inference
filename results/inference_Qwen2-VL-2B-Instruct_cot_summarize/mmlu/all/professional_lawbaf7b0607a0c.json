This typically involves a premeditated act of violence, such as a murder committed during a robbery or a similar crime.\n\nOn the other hand, manslaughter occurs when a person intentionally causes the death of another person but does not intend to kill. This typically involves a sudden and accidental act of violence, such as a shooting or stabbing.\n\nIn this case, the man entered the store with the intention of robbing it, but he did not intend to kill the store manager. He was not acting in a premeditated manner to cause the death of the manager. Therefore, he did not commit felony murder.\n\nHowever, the man did cause the death of the clerk. The man's actions were intentional and premeditated, and he intended to kill the clerk. This is a murder, and therefore, he committed felony murder.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk."
