The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history. You do not know if he takes any medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone. The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Administer intravenous antibiotics\nB. Await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management\nC. Obtain CT scan of the head\nD. Obtain echocardiography\n"

This is because the patient is noncommunicative and the initial history is not obtainable, which could indicate a neurological abnormality. A CT scan can help to rule out potential causes of lethargy and other symptoms, such as a stroke or other neurological disorders. It is important to proceed with management only after confirming the diagnosis and ensuring the patient's safety."
