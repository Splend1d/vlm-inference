It is possible to place an linear order relation \u2264 on the complex numbers C such that (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) is not an ordered field.\n- This statement is false. The complex numbers C form an ordered field under the operations of addition (+) and multiplication (\u00d7), and the order relation \u2264 is defined as \\(a \\leq b\\) if and only if \\(a - b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), which is a subset of the integers. This order relation is indeed an ordered field.\n\nB. It is possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers C which make (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) an ordered field.\n- This statement is also false. The complex numbers C do not form an ordered field under the operations of addition (+) and multiplication (\u00d7), and the order relation \u2264 is not defined in a way that makes C an ordered field. The order relation \u2264 is defined as \\(a \\leq b\\) if and only if \\(a - b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), which is a subset of the integers, but it does not satisfy the properties of an ordered field.\n\nC. Neither (a) nor (b).\n- This statement is true. The analysis of both statements shows that they are mutually exclusive, meaning that neither can be true simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Neither (a) nor (b)."
