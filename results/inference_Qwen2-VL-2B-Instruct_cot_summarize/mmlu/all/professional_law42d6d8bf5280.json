The witness can only confirm for the prosecution that a car was stolen, the model and type of car, and that it was missing from the property on a certain date. The defense asks witness \"isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.\nB. Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.\nC. No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators, or about police misconduct, is always permissible.\nD. No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.\n"

This principle is known as the \"double jeopardy\" rule, which prevents a person from being tried for the same crime twice, even if the evidence against the first trial is not conclusive.\n\nIn this case, the defense's question is based on the possibility that the car was stolen by someone else, which is a speculative claim. The prosecution's objection is based on the fact that the defense is attempting to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence. The prosecution argues that the defense's question is not permissible because it is not based on substantial evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence."
