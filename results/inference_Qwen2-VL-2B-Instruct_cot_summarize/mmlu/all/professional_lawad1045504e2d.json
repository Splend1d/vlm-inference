He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the crop- duster mistakenly sprays a strong herbicide, rather than a pesticide, and kills all the corn plants in the field. Several days later, a construction company building a house near the farmer's field negligently hits a gas line and starts a fire that burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field. If the farmer brings negligence claims against the crop-duster and the construction company in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop, the most likely result is\n\nA. only the crop-duster is liable, because its negligence occurred before the construction company's negligence.\nB. only the construction company is liable, because its negligence would have destroyed the farmer's corn crop no matter what the crop- duster did.\nC. both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.\nD. neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because neither is a \"but for\" cause of the harm.\n"

Both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Negligence by the Crop-Duster**: The crop-duster's negligence is the cause of the damage to the corn crop. The crop-duster's action of spraying the strong herbicide instead of a pesticide was the direct cause of the damage.\n\n2. **Negligence by the Construction Company**: The construction company's negligence is the cause of the fire that destroyed the farmer's corn crop. The construction company's negligence led to the accidental ignition of the gas line, which caused the fire.\n\nSince both the crop-duster and the construction company engaged in negligent actions that resulted in the same harm (the destruction of the corn crop), they are both liable for the damages."
