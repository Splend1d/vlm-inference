Offering to do something that is not consensual or not in the interests of the other person is generally considered morally wrong. In scenario 2, the main character changed their son's diaper whenever it was dirty, which is a common and necessary act of care for a child. This is generally considered a morally acceptable action, as it is a necessary and practical step for the child's well-being."
