The statement \"For any two variables x and y having joint distribution p(x, y), we always have H[x, y] \u2265 H[x] + H[y] where H is entropy function\" is not universally true. The inequality holds only under certain conditions, such as when the variables are independent or when the joint distribution is a product of two independent distributions. However, it is not always true for all joint distributions.\n\nStatement 2 is true. Moralization, which is the process of reducing the number of edges in a directed graph, does indeed decrease the number of edges present in the graph. This is a well-known property of moralization in graph theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
