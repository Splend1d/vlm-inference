The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?\n\nA. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\nB. No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.\nC. Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.\nD. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\n"

The mechanic agreed to deliver the truck if the landscaper agreed to pay an additional $2,000. The landscaper agreed to pay the additional $2,000.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Promise**: The landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000 was made in writing and was considered a modification of the original contract. The landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.\n\n3. **Evaluation of the Mechanic's Position**: The mechanic had the right to demand payment of the additional $2,000 as a condition for delivering the truck. The landscaper agreed to pay the additional $2,000, which was a reasonable price for the additional work.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000 was a valid modification of the original contract. The mechanic had the right to demand payment of the additional $2,000 as a condition for delivering the truck. Therefore, the mechanic will be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price."
