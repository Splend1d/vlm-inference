After a while, he got in bed and had sexual relations with the woman while she slept. At trial, he claimed that he believed that the woman had consented because he had dated her many times and had consensual sexual relations with her many times in the past. He hadn't seen her in about one week but assumed her consent. He denied specific intent to rape and claimed a desire to surprise her with a \"romantic\" variation of their usual activities. The woman admitted to prior consensual relations but denied consent on this occasion. Has he stated a viable defense to rape?\n\nA. No, his belief that she consented in advance was unreasonable and impermissible.\nB. Yes, rape is a specific intent crime and there's no evidence that he intended a criminal result.\nC. Yes, his belief that she consented was reasonable based on prior experience.\nD. No, rape of an unconscious woman is a strict liability crime that does not permit a defense.\n"

The key issue here is whether the man's belief that she consented was reasonable based on his prior consensual experiences with her.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No, his belief that she consented in advance was unreasonable and impermissible.**\n   - This option suggests that the man's belief was unreasonable and impermissible. However, the scenario does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that his belief was unreasonable or impermissible. The man's belief was based on his prior consensual experiences, which might be considered reasonable given that he had dated her many times and had consensual sexual relations with her in the past. The issue here is not the reasonableness of his belief but rather the intent to rape.\n\nB. **Yes, rape is a specific intent crime and there's no evidence that he intended a criminal result.**\n   - This option suggests that rape is a specific intent crime and there is no evidence that he intended a criminal result. However, the scenario does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the man intended a criminal result. The man's belief that she consented was based on his prior consensual experiences, which might not necessarily indicate an intent to rape.\n\nC. **Yes, his belief that she consented was reasonable based on prior experience.**\n   - This option suggests that the man's belief was reasonable based on his prior consensual experiences. The scenario does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the man's belief was unreasonable or impermissible. The man's belief was based on his prior consensual experiences, which might be considered reasonable given that he had dated her many times and had consensual sexual relations with her in the past.\n\nD. **No, rape of an unconscious woman is a strict liability crime that does not permit a defense.**\n   - This option suggests that rape of an unconscious woman is a strict liability crime and does not permit a defense. However, the scenario does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the man intended a criminal result. The man's belief that she consented was based on his prior consensual experiences, which might not necessarily indicate an intent to rape.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, his belief that she consented was reasonable based on prior experience.**\n\nThis option aligns with the scenario's description and the man's belief that she consented based on his prior consensual experiences."
