The state levies a general tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state. The state seeks to tax the agency on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state. Must the agency pay the state gross receipts tax?\n\nA. No, because a federal agency may not pay any monies to a state without explicit federal statutory authorization to do so.\nB. No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\nC. Yes, because it is a generally applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.\nD. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.\n"

This implies that the federal government has the authority to establish and regulate the lottery, including the sale of lottery tickets.\n\n2. **State Tax on Gaming Operations**: The state levies a general tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state. This tax is specifically directed at gaming operations, not the federal agency.\n\n3. **Federal Agency's Authority**: The federal agency is authorized to sell lottery tickets directly to the public, which implies that it has the authority to operate outlets and sell lottery tickets.\n\n4. **State Tax on Federal Agency**: The state seeks to tax the agency on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state. This tax is directed at the federal agency, not the state.\n\nGiven these points, the key issue is whether the federal agency is subject to the state's tax on its commercial activities.\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the federal agency may not pay any monies to the state without explicit federal statutory authorization. However, the federal statute established the national lottery and created the federal agency, implying that the federal agency has the authority to operate outlets and sell lottery tickets.\n\n- **Option B**: This option states that the state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. This is not relevant to the specific context of the federal agency selling lottery tickets.\n\n- **Option C**: This option states that the tax is generally applicable and does not discriminate against the agency. This is not relevant to the specific context of the federal agency selling lottery tickets.\n\n- **Option D**: This option states that the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities. This is relevant because the federal agency is a commercial entity, and the state has the authority to tax commercial activities.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.**"
