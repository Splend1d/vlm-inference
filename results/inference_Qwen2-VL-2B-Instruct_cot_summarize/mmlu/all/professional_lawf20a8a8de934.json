Their contract provided that the artist would paint a full-color portrait of the man, to be delivered by November 1, in exchange for $15,000. A contractual provision recited that the artist \"guarantees that the quality of the portrait will be fully satisfactory. \"The artist finished the portrait and presented it to the man on November 2. The man looked at the portrait and said, \"This is awful! I really expected better. I'm not paying for this!\" The artist was enraged by the man's reaction, as he felt the finished portrait was one of his best works. Which of the following arguments would be LEAST helpful to the artist in his efforts to recover on a breach of contract theory?\n\nA. The man's dissatisfaction with the quality of the portrait was not genuine.\nB. The man failed to make an adequate examination of the quality of the portrait.\nC. The man's dissatisfaction with the portrait was the result of delivery after November 1, rather than of any lack of quality in the portrait.\nD. Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.\n"

Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.\n\nThis argument is least helpful because it shifts the blame for the dissatisfaction to the artist's own circumstances, rather than addressing the actual quality of the portrait itself. The artist's dissatisfaction with the quality of the portrait is a legitimate concern, but the argument that the artist's hand injury was the reason for the dissatisfaction is not helpful in recovering the contract's terms. The other options (A, B, and C) address the man's dissatisfaction with the quality of the portrait and the reasons for his dissatisfaction, which are more directly relevant to the recovery of the contract."
