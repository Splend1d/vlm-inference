The derivative of a function at a point gives the slope of the tangent line at that point. If we know the derivative at a point, we can use it to estimate the value of the function at another point.\n\nThe derivative of F(x) at x = 3 is -4. This means that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of F(x) at x = 3 is -4. We can use this information to estimate the value of F(3.02).\n\nTo do this, we can use the point-slope form of a line, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. In this case, we know that the slope m = -4 and the point (3, F(3)) = (3, 8). We can use these values to find the value of F(3.02):\n\ny - 8 = -4(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = -4x + 12 + 8\n\ny = -4x + 20\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 3.02 into the equation to find the value of y:\n\ny = -4(3.02) + 20\n\ny = -12.08 + 20\n\ny = 7.92\n\nTherefore, the value of F(3.02) is approximately 7.92.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 7.92."
