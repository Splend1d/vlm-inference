After mapping into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, the unweighted Euclidean distance in the feature space can be used to perform nearest neighbor (1-NN) classification, which can potentially achieve better classification performance than in the original space. This is because the kernel trick allows us to implicitly transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where it might be easier to find a separating hyperplane.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The VC dimension of a Perceptron is indeed smaller than the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM. The VC dimension is a measure of the capacity of a learning algorithm to generalize from a finite set of examples to an infinite set. A Perceptron, being a linear classifier, has a VC dimension equal to the dimension of the input space, while a simple linear SVM has a VC dimension equal to the dimension of the input space plus one (since it can be represented as a linear combination of the input space).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
