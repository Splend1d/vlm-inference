This compatibility might lead to a higher likelihood of success in the occupation. However, the statement that Group B members would achieve levels of success equal to those of Group A, but would do so more slowly, is not necessarily justified. It could be that Group B members would achieve success at a similar level but would take longer to achieve it.\n\nGiven the information, the most justified statement is:\n\n**Option C: Group A members would be more likely to succeed in the occupation**\n\nThis is because Group A members share interests with engineers, which is likely to lead to a higher likelihood of success in the occupation."
