This change in zoning is cumulative, meaning that the daughter's nonconforming use of the building (shoe store) would be terminated if she were to continue operating it.\n\n2. **Nature of the Nonconforming Use**: The shoe store was a nonconforming use of the building when it was purchased by the couple. This means that the building was not intended for residential use and was not in compliance with the zoning regulations at the time of purchase.\n\n3. **Termination of Nonconforming Use**: Since the building is now zoned for residential use, the nonconforming use of the shoe store would be terminated. This means that the daughter cannot continue to operate the shoe store as a nonconforming use.\n\nGiven these points, the lawyer should advise the daughter that she cannot continue to operate her shoe store because the nonconforming use of the building has been terminated by the rezoning of the area.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. No, because the nonconforming use of the building terminated when the daughter's parents died."
