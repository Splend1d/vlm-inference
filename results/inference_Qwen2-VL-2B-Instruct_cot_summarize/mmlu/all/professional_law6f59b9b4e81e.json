The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the state law was consistent with the federal law and with federal policy on Cuba.\nB. No, a state has the sovereign right to pass its own laws concerning its policies toward foreign countries.\nC. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\nD.

The federal court is likely to find that the state law is unconstitutional because it interferes with the foreign affairs power of the federal government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba, and the federal court is likely to interpret this statute as providing the federal government with the authority to regulate trade with Cuba. The state's law, which prohibits the state's agencies from purchasing services or goods from and companies doing business with Cuba, is likely to be found to be inconsistent with the federal law and policy on Cuba. Therefore, the federal court is likely to declare the state law unconstitutional. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government."
