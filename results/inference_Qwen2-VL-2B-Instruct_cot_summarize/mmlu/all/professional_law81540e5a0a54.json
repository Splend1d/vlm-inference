Due to allegations of illegal activities in other massage parlors not affiliated with this owner, the city canceled the owner's personal license and revoked the business permits. The only information provided was a general notice from the city declaring a new policy on massage parlors that had to be rapidly instituted for the welfare of the community. She sued the city in federal court, claiming that her business had been taken without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment takings clause. She claimed a lack of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted a motion to dismiss based on her not having a property interest that was affected, including in the license and permits. She appealed the decision. Will the federal Court of Appeals affirm the lower court dismissal of her case?\n\nA. Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.\nB. Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required the state action that was taken.\nC. No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.\nD. No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the federal Court of Appeals will affirm the lower court dismissal of the case, we need to analyze the legal principles involved and the context provided.\n\n1. **Substantive Due Process Clause**: This clause protects against arbitrary deprivation of property without due process of law. It requires that the government must provide a fair and public hearing before taking away a property right. The owner claims that the state's action of canceling her license and business permits was arbitrary and without due process.\n\n2. **Takings Clause**: This clause protects against the government taking private property without just compensation. The owner claims that she was deprived of her property without just compensation.\n\n3. **Procedural Due Process**: This clause requires that the government provide a fair and public hearing before taking away a property right. The owner claims that she was denied a fair hearing before the state took away her business permits.\n\n4. **Right to Earn a Living**: The owner claims that she had a property interest in her business, which was taken away without due process.\n\nGiven the context provided, the key issue is whether the state's action of canceling the owner's license and business permits was arbitrary and without due process. The owner claims that she had a property interest in her business, which was taken away without due process.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n- **Option A: Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.**\n  - This option suggests that the owner's claim of a property interest in earning a living is irrelevant to the substantive due process clause. However, the substantive due process clause does protect against arbitrary deprivation of property without due process, and the owner's claim of a property interest in earning a living is relevant to the substantive due process clause.\n\n- **Option B: Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required the state action that was taken.**\n  - This option suggests that the state's action was justified by a public interest in protecting the public from illegal activities. However, the owner's claim of a property interest in earning a living is relevant to the substantive due process clause, and the state's action was not justified by a public interest in protecting the public from illegal activities.\n\n- **Option C: No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.**\n  - This option suggests that the owner's business was already in operation and could not be deprived of its licenses until they were up for renewal. However, the owner's claim of a property interest in earning a living is relevant to the substantive due process clause, and the state's action was not justified by a public interest in protecting the public from illegal activities.\n\n- **Option D: No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.**\n  - This option suggests that the owner had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process. However, the owner's claim of a property interest in earning a living is relevant to the substantive due process clause, and the state's action was not justified by a public interest in protecting the public from illegal activities.\n\nGiven the context provided, the key issue is whether the state's action of canceling the owner's license and business permits was arbitrary and without due process. The owner claims that she had a property interest in her business, which was taken away without due process.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe federal Court of Appeals will most likely affirm the lower court dismissal of the case because the state's action of canceling the owner's license and business permits was arbitrary and without due process, and the owner's claim of a property interest in earning a living is relevant to the substantive due process clause."
