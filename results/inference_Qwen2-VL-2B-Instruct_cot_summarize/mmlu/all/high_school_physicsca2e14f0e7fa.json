The wave pulse\u2019s width has become smaller.\n\nWhen a wave encounters an obstacle, such as the child\u2019s ankles, the wave's energy is dissipated as the wave's amplitude (height) decreases and the wave's width (pulse width) increases. This is because the wave's energy is transferred to the obstacle, causing it to deform and lose its shape. Therefore, the wave pulse's width becomes larger, indicating that the wave has lost energy as it encounters the obstacle."
