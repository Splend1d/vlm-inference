Rachels argues that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die, which implies that both active and passive euthanasia are morally permissible.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Both active and passive euthanasia involve the intentional termination of a human life with dignity; therefore, both are morally wrong.**\n   - This option suggests that both forms of euthanasia are morally wrong because they involve the intentional termination of a human life with dignity. This aligns with Rachels's argument that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die.\n\nB. **Neither active nor passive euthanasia involves the intentional termination of a human life with dignity; therefore, both are morally permissible.**\n   - This option suggests that neither active nor passive euthanasia involves the intentional termination of a human life with dignity, making both morally permissible. This contradicts Rachels's argument, which asserts that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die.\n\nC. **There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia.**\n   - This option suggests that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die, implying that there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia. This aligns with Rachels's argument that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die.\n\nD. **There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, both active and passive euthanasia are morally wrong.**\n   - This option suggests that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die, making both morally wrong. This contradicts Rachels's argument, which asserts that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best characterizes Rachels's argument is:\n\n**C. There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia.**\n\nFinal answer: C"
