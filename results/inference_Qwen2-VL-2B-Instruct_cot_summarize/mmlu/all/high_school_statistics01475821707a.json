This is because the binomial model assumes that each outcome is independent and has the same probability of occurring, which is not the case in this situation. In situation D, the number of students present in a class of 22 can be influenced by various factors such as the number of students who decided to attend the class, the number of students who decided to stay at home, and the number of students who decided to leave the class. Therefore, the binomial model is not an appropriate model to describe the outcome in this situation."
