The United States has comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has comparative advantage in anchovy production.\n\nWhen nations are trading based on relative opportunity costs, it means that each country has a comparative advantage in producing a good. A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if it can produce that good at a lower opportunity cost than another country. In this case, the United States has a comparative advantage in salmon production because it can produce salmon at a lower opportunity cost than Peru can produce anchovies. Conversely, Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovy production because it can produce anchovies at a lower opportunity cost than the United States can produce salmon."
