At trial, the manufacturer has called as an expert witness a product safety engineer, who testifies that the manufacturer retained him for a fee to test identical mowers and, if his opinion was helpful, to testify in the case. The expert then testifies that he did test the mowers, and that the blade, as designed and installed by the manufacturer, could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff. Assume that the expert has used a reliable method for reaching his conclusion. Should the court admit the expert's testimony?\n\nA.

The expert's testimony is relevant and helpful to the jury because it addresses the ultimate issue of causation, which is a critical factor in determining liability in a product liability case. The expert's opinion that the blade could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff is based on the manufacturer's testing and design, which is relevant to the jury's determination of whether the manufacturer's design was defective and caused the plaintiff's injury. Therefore, the court should admit the expert's testimony, even though it was paid for by the manufacturer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury."
