Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:\"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. \"Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?\n\nA. No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\nB. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether Harriet is likely to prevail in the action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate, we need to analyze the provisions of the will and the circumstances surrounding the death of Stan and Morgana.\n\n1. **Walter's Will**: The will states that the net income from the trust shall be paid to Stan for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income to the living children of Harriet in equal shares.\n\n2. **Stan's Death**: Stan died in 2009. Morgana died in 2009, and Grace was born in 2001. Therefore, at the time of Walter's death, Stan was not alive, and therefore, there was no widow of Stan to receive the income.\n\n3. **Harriet's Status**: Harriet is the surviving child of Stan and Morgana. According to the will, upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Since Stan was not alive at the time of Walter's death, there was no widow of Stan to receive the income.\n\n4. **Trend Trust Company's Role**: The will specifies that the income from the trust is to be paid to the living children of Harriet in equal shares. Therefore, the income from the trust is intended to be paid to the living children of Harriet, not to Grace.\n\nGiven these points, the key issue is whether the provisions of the will violate the Rule against Perpetuities, which states that a person cannot be perpetually alive.\n\n- **Rule against Perpetuities**: If a person is perpetually alive, the will cannot be enforced because it would perpetually benefit the person.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Since Stan was not alive at the time of Walter's death, there was no widow of Stan to receive the income. Therefore, the provisions of the will are not violated by the fact that Stan was not alive at the time of Walter's death.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased."
