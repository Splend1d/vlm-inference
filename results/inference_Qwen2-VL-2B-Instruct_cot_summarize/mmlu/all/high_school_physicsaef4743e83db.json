II and III only.\n\nWhen two identical capacitors are connected in parallel to an external circuit, the following quantities must be the same for both capacitors:\n\n1. The charge stored on the capacitor (Q) is the same for both capacitors because the charge is proportional to the capacitance and inversely proportional to the voltage across the capacitor. In parallel capacitors, the voltage across each capacitor is the same, so the charge on each capacitor is also the same.\n\n2. The capacitance of the capacitor (C) is the same for both capacitors because capacitance is a property of the capacitor and does not change with the connection to an external circuit."
