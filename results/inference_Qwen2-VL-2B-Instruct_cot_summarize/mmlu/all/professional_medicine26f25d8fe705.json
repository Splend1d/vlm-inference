Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline\n\nThis combination is indicated for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea and chlamydia, which are common causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Ceftriaxone is an effective antibiotic for treating these infections, while doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can be used to treat gonorrhea and chlamydia. It is important to note that the patient should be evaluated by a healthcare provider for appropriate antibiotic therapy and to ensure that the patient is not allergic to any of the antibiotics."
