                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of mutually exclusive events. Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur at the same time. In this case, the two events are the two integers chosen not to be the square of the other.\n\nLet's denote the two integers chosen by Sofia and Tess as \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), respectively. The condition that neither integer is the square of the other can be represented as:\n\n\\[a \\neq b^2\\]\n\\[b \\neq a^2\\]\n\nThis means that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) cannot both be the square of the other. The total number of ways to choose 2 integers from 1 to 10 is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\).\n\nFor Sofia and Tess, there are \\(C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = 45\\) ways to choose 2 integers from 10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 2 integers such that neither is the square of the other. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of ways in which both integers are squares of each other and subtract this from the total number of ways to choose 2 integers.\n\nLet \\(S\\) be the set of integers from 1 to 10 that are squares of each other. There are 5 integers in \\(S\\): \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 integers from \\(S\\) is \\(C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10\\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 integers from the remaining 5 integers (1 to 10) is \\(C(5, 2) = 10\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 integers such that neither is the square of the other is \\(10 + 10 - 2 = 22\\).\n\nThe probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{22}{45}\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 22 and 45, which is 3. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 3 gives:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{22 \\div 3}{45 \\div 3} = \\frac{7}{15}\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\), which is equivalent to \\(0.4667\\), or approximately \\(0.47\\). However, the options provided are in decimal form, so the closest match to our calculation is:\n\n\\[0.47\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0.95"
