According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, carrying a knife with the intent to use it for self-defense is generally considered morally wrong. However, the act of carrying the knife with the intent to use it is not inherently wrong; it is the use of the knife that is morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character had sex at work. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, having sex at work is generally considered morally wrong. However, the act of having sex at work is not inherently wrong; it is the context in which the act occurs that is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the main character in scenario 1 is doing something clearly morally wrong, while the main character in scenario 2 is not doing anything clearly morally wrong."
