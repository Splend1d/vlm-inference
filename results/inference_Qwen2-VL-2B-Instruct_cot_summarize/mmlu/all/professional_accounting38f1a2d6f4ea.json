The agreement calls for an interest rate of 10% on fund used, a 15% compensating balance, and a commitment fee of 1% on the unused amount of the credit line. Assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained, the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year is closest to\n\nA. 11.5 percent.\nB. 15 percent.\nC. 26.5 percent.\nD. 13.53 percent.\n"

Interest on the compensating balance: $500,000 * 15% = $500,000 * 0.15 = $75,000\n3. Interest on the unused amount: $500,000 * 1% = $500,000 * 0.01 = $5,000\n4. Total interest cost: $50,000 + $75,000 + $5,000 = $120,000\n\nThe effective annual interest cost is the total interest cost divided by the amount borrowed, which is $120,000 / $200,000 = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is:\n\nC. 26.5 percent."
