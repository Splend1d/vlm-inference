The petroleum derivatives were sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after putting the jugs in the back of his car, the scientist was driving along a city street. He was thinking about a difficult scientific question and not paying attention to his driving. As a result, he lost control of the car and drove up onto the sidewalk. The car flipped over. The glass jugs in the back of the car were broken, and the chemicals in them spilled out onto the sidewalk. Moments later, a doctor who witnessed the accident came running over to render medical assistance. As he approached the overturned car, however, the doctor slipped on the petroleum derivatives that had spilled onto the sidewalk. The doctor fell and fractured his ankle. If the doctor asserts a claim against the scientist based on strict liability, will the doctor prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.\nB. Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm.\nC. No, because the doctor assumed the risk by voluntarily acting as a Good Samaritan.\nD. No, because it was unforeseeable that the doctor's injury would result from the type of harm threatened.\n"

                    "text": "The doctor's claim against the scientist based on strict liability will likely be upheld. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Claim**: The doctor is asserting a claim for damages based on strict liability. This means the doctor is holding the scientist responsible for the doctor's injuries, regardless of whether the scientist intended to cause harm or not.\n\n2. **Nature of the Activity**: The scientist was transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs. This activity involves a high degree of risk of serious harm, as flammable materials can be highly dangerous when improperly handled.\n\n3. **Nature of the Injury**: The doctor's injury was caused by petroleum derivatives that spilled onto the sidewalk. This is a type of harm that is typically considered foreseeable and potentially dangerous, especially when the petroleum derivatives are highly flammable.\n\n4. **Nature of the Risk**: The risk of harm from the petroleum derivatives was inherent in the activity of transporting them. The doctor was aware of the danger and voluntarily acted as a Good Samaritan, which is a recognized defense in strict liability cases.\n\nGiven these points, the doctor's claim is based on the inherent risk of the activity and the foreseeability of the harm caused by the spilled petroleum derivatives. Therefore, the doctor will likely prevail in this case.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm."
