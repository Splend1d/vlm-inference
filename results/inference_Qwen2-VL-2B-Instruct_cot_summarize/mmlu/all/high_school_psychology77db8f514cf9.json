Dr. Ramchandran found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities in their teeth as those who didn't.\n2. The newswriter claims that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities.\n\nFrom the information given, we can infer that brushing teeth after lunch reduces the number of cavities by 1/20. This means that if a patient brushed their teeth after lunch, they would have 1/20 the number of cavities compared to those who didn't brush.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The writer's statement is based on a single observation (1/20 reduction in cavities) and does not account for the variability in the number of patients studied. The writer's statement is not guaranteed to hold for all patients.\n\nB. If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true either. The writer's statement is based on a single observation (1/20 reduction in cavities) and does not account for the variability in the number of patients studied. The writer's statement is not guaranteed to hold for all patients.\n\nC. At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The writer's statement is based on a single observation (1/20 reduction in cavities) and does not account for the variability in the number of patients studied.

The writer's statement is based on a single observation (1/20 reduction in cavities) and does not account for the variability in the number of patients studied. The writer's statement is not guaranteed to hold for all patients.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is true is:\n\nD. No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified."
