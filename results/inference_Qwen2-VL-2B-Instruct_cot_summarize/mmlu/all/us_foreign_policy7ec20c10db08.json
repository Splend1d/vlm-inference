Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government\n\nAmerican exceptionalism, which emphasizes the unique qualities and achievements of the United States, can lead to opposition to world government because it views centralized government as a threat to individual liberty and freedom. This opposition to world government is often rooted in a belief that the United States should not be forced to conform to international norms or agreements that might limit its sovereignty or individual rights."
