In 2002, Goodboy Beverages purchased Daylight's deluxe cutting press model for $20,000. In 2002 and 2003, Daylight received a few complaints that other cutting press customers had experienced hazardous malfunctions. In response, Daylight created a safety device and offered it for $5,000 in a brochure sent to all their customers that mentioned that a few users had been injured in using the cutting press model. Goodboy received the brochure, but did not buy a $5,000 safety device. In 2004, a Goodboy worker was injured by the press. At trial, Daylight argued that if Goodboy had purchased the safety device the injury would not have occurred, and moved for a directed verdict. The court should\n\nA. Grant Daystar's motion, because Goodboy's refusal to purchase the safety device was an effective assumption of risk.\nB. Deny the motion, because Goodboy's negligence in failing to purchase the safety device was less than Daylight's negligence in manufacturing the unsafe press initially.\nC. Deny the motion, because a jury could find that Daylight could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\nD. Deny the motion, because since the press was inherently dangerous, Daylight was strictly liable.\n"

Deny the motion, because a jury could find that Daylight could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\n\nIn the context of the case, Daylight Corp. manufactured and marketed a steel cutting press designed to cut aluminum sheets into can covers. In 2002, Goodboy Beverages purchased Daylight's deluxe cutting press model for $20,000. In 2002 and 2003, Daylight received a few complaints that other cutting press customers had experienced hazardous malfunctions.

Goodboy received the brochure, but did not buy a $5,000 safety device.\n\nThe key issue in this case is whether Daylight Corp. could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device. The court should consider whether Daylight could have reasonably anticipated that Goodboy would not be willing to pay for the safety device, given the nature of the product and the potential risks associated with it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Daylight Corp. did not argue that Goodboy's refusal to purchase the safety device was an effective assumption of risk. Option B is incorrect because Daylight Corp. did not argue that Goodboy's negligence in failing to purchase the safety device was less than Daylight Corp.'s negligence in manufacturing the unsafe press initially. Option D is incorrect because since the press was inherently dangerous, Daylight Corp. was strictly liable, not liable for negligence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
