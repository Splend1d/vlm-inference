If the tallest person's height is corrected, the mean of the dataset will change, but the MAD will remain unchanged because it is based on the absolute differences from the mean.\n\n2. **Standard Deviation (SD)**: This measures the dispersion of the data points from the mean. If the tallest person's height is corrected, the mean of the dataset will change, but the SD will remain unchanged because it is based on the standard deviation of the data points around the mean.\n\n3. **Variance**: This is the average of the squared differences from the Mean. If the tallest person's height is corrected, the mean of the dataset will change, but the variance will remain unchanged because it is based on the squared differences from the mean.\n\n4. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: This is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). If the tallest person's height is corrected, the mean of the dataset will change, but the IQR will remain unchanged because it is based on the interquartile range, which is not affected by the mean.\n\nTherefore, the measure of spread that must remain unchanged is:\n\n**D. Interquartile range**"
