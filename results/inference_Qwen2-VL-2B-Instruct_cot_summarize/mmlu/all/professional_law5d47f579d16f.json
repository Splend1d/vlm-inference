They had relied on a business attorney in establishing the business. After the business failed, the plaintiff and the defendant disagreed about their respective obligations. At trial, both have hired new counsel. The plaintiff calls the business attorney to testify to representations the defendant made in meetings she had with the plaintiff and the business attorney. The defendant objects to the business attorney's testimony, invoking the attorney-client privilege. Should the court uphold the defendant's privilege claim?\n\nA. No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\nB. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\nC. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may block disclosure of statements made during such meetings.\nD. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\n"

The plaintiff and the defendant are not the same party, and the attorney-client privilege does not apply to communications between them. Therefore, the court should uphold the defendant's privilege claim.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\n   - This is not relevant to the attorney-client privilege.
