This was the first action taken, and the creditor did not have a judgment. It served the notice of garnishment on the garnishee, the woman's employer. The employer honored the notice by holding all of the woman's earnings in escrow pending the creditor's lawsuit and entrance of final judgment against the woman. The state where defendant lived and worked had a provision for pre-judgment garnishment, as long as the money was held and not distributed until a judgment was entered. The money would be paid to the woman if a judgment was not entered with the next 120 days. The woman sued the employer and the creditor, demanding release of her earnings. Will the court order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman?\n\nA. No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.\nB. No, because the state has an interest in protecting the rights of creditors to collect debts through the garnishment procedure.\nC. Yes, because the only party that has garnishment rights in the United States is the Internal Revenue Service.\nD. Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.\n"

The state's provision for pre-judgment garnishment, which allows the garnishee to hold the money in escrow until a judgment is entered, is a fair and procedural due process measure. This provision ensures that the money is held until the creditor has a chance to prove their debt, which is a fundamental aspect of the judicial process. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process."
