Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\n2. Or China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2261 S)\n- This option suggests that either England's importing beef is necessary for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China's promoting human rights is not sufficient for South Africa's supplying diamonds. This option captures the essence of the sentence by stating that the two conditions are either both true or both false.\n\nB. (E \u2261 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\n- This option suggests that either England's importing beef is necessary for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China's promoting human rights is sufficient for South Africa's supplying diamonds. This option captures the essence of the sentence by stating that the two conditions are either both true or both false, but it does not explicitly state that one condition is necessary and the other is not.\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n- This option suggests that either England's importing beef is sufficient for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China's promoting human rights is not sufficient for South Africa's supplying diamonds. This option captures the essence of the sentence by stating that the two conditions are either both true or both false, but it does not explicitly state that one condition is necessary and the other is not.\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 ~(C \u2283 S)\n- This option suggests that either France's subsidizing agriculture is necessary for England's importing beef, or South Africa's supplying diamonds is sufficient for China's promoting human rights. This option captures the essence of the sentence by stating that the two conditions are either both true or both false, but it does not explicitly state that one condition is necessary and the other is not.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nA.
