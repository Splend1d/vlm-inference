The manager takes a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks. He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?\n\nA. The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.\nB. The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.\nC. The population standard deviations at both locations are known.\nD. The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.\n"

This is because the t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two independent groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. If the population standard deviations are not equal, the t-test may not be appropriate, and other tests such as the independent samples t-test may be more suitable."
