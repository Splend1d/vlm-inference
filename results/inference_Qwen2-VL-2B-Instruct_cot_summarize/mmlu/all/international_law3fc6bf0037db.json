The local remedies rule aims on the one hand to restrict the volume of petitions to international tribunals while at the same time building up the capacity of local courts.\n\nThe local remedies rule is a principle in international human rights law that allows states to use local courts to handle certain types of cases, such as those involving domestic violence or minor crimes, rather than having to send cases to international tribunals. This rule is intended to help states build up their own legal systems and to ensure that they have the capacity to handle domestic cases effectively. By limiting the number of cases that must be sent to international tribunals, the local remedies rule aims to reduce the workload on international tribunals and to ensure that they are only dealing with the most serious cases. At the same time, the rule is also intended to build up the capacity of local courts, which can then handle more cases and provide a more comprehensive and effective system for dealing with domestic disputes."
