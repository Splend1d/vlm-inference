Resolution 678 is broader because it authorised the use of force with respect to any matter threatening the peace and security of the Gulf region.\n\nThe resolution was broader because it allowed for the use of force against any threat to the peace and security of the Gulf region, which was not explicitly covered under Article 51 of the UN Charter. This was a significant departure from the collective defensive action under Article 51, which only allowed for collective defense against an attack by another member state."
