Cutting fingernails with clippers can cause significant harm to the child's nails and potentially lead to infections or other complications. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) shrieked when their mother cut herself badly while washing dishes, which is not considered morally wrong. Shrieking in response to a minor injury is generally considered a normal and appropriate response to the situation."
