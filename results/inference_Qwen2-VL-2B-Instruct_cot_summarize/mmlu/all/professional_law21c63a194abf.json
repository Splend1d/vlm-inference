The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. Assume that after the treaty goes into effect, a state legislature enacts a statute that provides that \"any licensed rabbit-hunter in the state and its surrounding environs may increase his monthly catch of rabbits from 10 to 15 in each of the specified months of the authorized rabbit-hunting season from the first day of October until the last day of February. \" If challenged, the enactment of the aforementioned statute would most likely be declared\n\nA. constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.\nB. constitutional, because the enactment falls within the Tenth Amendment's reservedpowers.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.\n"

                    "text": "The problem involves understanding the implications of a state legislature enacting a statute that changes the regulations governing rabbit hunting in the state. The context is that the President and the foreign government have already agreed on a treaty that established a permanent commission to monitor and enforce the regulations. The question asks whether the new statute, which allows for an increase in the number of rabbits that can be hunted, would be considered constitutional.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.\n- This option suggests that the regulation of hunting is a state matter and therefore not subject to federal or international treaties. However, the treaty in question is about preventing the extinction of certain species of rabbits, which is a matter of international concern and therefore not purely state action. This option is not entirely accurate.\n\nB. Constitutional, because the enactment falls within the Tenth Amendment's reserved powers.\n- The Tenth Amendment states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states or the people. This does not apply here because the treaty is about preventing the extinction of rabbits, which is a matter of international concern, not a state matter.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.\n- The commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution is about trade and commerce between states and the federal government. The statute in question does not involve trade or commerce between states and the federal government. Therefore, it does not violate the commerce clause.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.\n- This option is incorrect because treaties are not the supreme law of the land. The treaty in question is about preventing the extinction of rabbits, which is a matter of international concern, not a state matter.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.\n\nFinal answer: C. Unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause."
