Therefore, if a technological innovation significantly raises the firm's marginal physical product, it will not directly affect the firm's marginal revenue. Instead, the innovation will increase the firm's total revenue, which will be distributed among all buyers, including the firm's workers.\n\nSince the firm is a price taker, it will not be able to raise its own wage rate. The increase in total revenue will be passed on to all buyers, including the firm's workers, but the firm will not be able to raise its own wage rate. Therefore, the firm will hire more workers but not raise their wages."
