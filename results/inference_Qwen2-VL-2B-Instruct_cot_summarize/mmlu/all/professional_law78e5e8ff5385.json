                    "text": "A state has recently released medical statistics showing that the number of new AIDS cases within the state has quadrupled from the preceding year. In 2008, the state reported that 2,250 people were diagnosed as being stricken with the AIDS virus. However, in 2009 the state confirmed that over 9,000 new persons contracted the deadly virus. In an effort to improve the health care of AIDS patients in the state, the Legislature has enacted a law providing public funds to assist privately owned hospitals. According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each AIDS patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of the state's statute?\n\nA. The statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, by adopting the controversial views of particular churches on abortion.\nB. The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment by conditioning the availability of public funds upon the recipient's agreement to act in a way that makes more difficult the exercise by others of their fundamental constitutional rights.\nC. The statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying nonAIDS patients the same subsidy benefits as those received by AIDS patients.\nD. The state will be unable to show it is advancing a legitimate governmental interest.\n"

The key issue here is whether the statute discriminates against hospitals that perform abortions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, by adopting the controversial views of particular churches on abortion.\n- This option suggests that the statute is unconstitutional because it involves religious views, which is not directly relevant to the issue of abortion. The statute does not involve religious views.\n\nB. The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment by conditioning the availability of public funds upon the recipient's agreement to act in a way that makes more difficult the exercise by others of their fundamental constitutional rights.\n- This option suggests that the statute discriminates against hospitals that perform abortions by requiring them to agree to certain conditions. This is a strong argument against the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nC. The statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying nonAIDS patients the same subsidy benefits as those received by AIDS patients.\n- This option suggests that the statute discriminates against non-AIDS patients by not providing the same benefits. This is a strong argument against the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nD. The state will be unable to show it is advancing a legitimate governmental interest.\n- This option suggests that the statute is unconstitutional because it does not demonstrate a legitimate governmental interest. This is a strong argument against the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the strongest argument against the constitutionality of the state's statute is:\n\nB. The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment by conditioning the availability of public funds upon the recipient's agreement to act in a way that makes more difficult the exercise by others of their fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nFinal answer: B"
