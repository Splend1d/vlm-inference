Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did something clearly morally wrong by clearing their laundry out of the washer and dryer so their roommate could do laundry. This action is considered morally wrong because it involves taking advantage of their roommate's situation to benefit themselves without their consent or understanding.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did something that is not clearly morally wrong. The main character told their daughter Keyla that she must find new friends because her current friends are druggies and a bad influence. This action is not morally wrong because it is a matter of choice and decision-making, and it does not involve any harm or exploitation of others."
