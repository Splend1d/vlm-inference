Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

This act provided financial assistance to veterans of World War II, including education and job training, which was seen as a way to address the grievances of veterans and to promote social stability and economic growth in the United States. The passage emphasizes the importance of keeping the hope of a better life alive and the need for Congress to face the responsibilities placed upon them by the swift movement of events. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (G.I. Bill)."
