The owner answered affirmatively and showed the woman two display trays of bracelets. As the woman was looking at a few of the pieces, the telephone in the store began to ring. The owner excused himself and walked to the rear of the store where he answered the telephone call. While the owner was speaking on the phone, the woman placed one of the bracelets in her pocketbook and walked a few feet toward the front door of the store. She was about to leave the store, without paying for the bracelet, when she suddenly noticed one of the other employees. Thinking that the employee had seen her place the bracelet in her pocketbook, the woman walked back to the counter and returned the bracelet to the display tray. In fact, the employee had seen the woman take the bracelet but decided not to say anything after she put it back. If the woman is subsequently prosecuted for larceny of the bracelet, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because it is not relevant that she returned the bracelet to the display tray.\nB. guilty, because the employee had actually seen her place the bracelet in her pocketbook.\nC. not guilty, because she returned the bracelet to the display tray.\nD. not guilty, because she didn't leave the store with the bracelet in her possession.\n"

The woman initially placed the bracelet in her pocketbook and then returned it to the display tray. This action is not considered theft because she did not leave the store with the bracelet in her possession. The act of returning the bracelet to the display tray is a legal act of restitution, not theft.\n\n2. The employee did not report the theft to the police because they did not see the woman take the bracelet from the display tray. This is a reasonable interpretation of the employee's behavior, as they did not have the opportunity to witness the theft.\n\n3. The woman's actions do not constitute larceny because she did not take the bracelet from the store and did not leave the store with it. The act of returning the bracelet to the display tray is a legal act of restitution, not theft.\n\nTherefore, the woman is not guilty of larceny because she did not leave the store with the bracelet in her possession."
