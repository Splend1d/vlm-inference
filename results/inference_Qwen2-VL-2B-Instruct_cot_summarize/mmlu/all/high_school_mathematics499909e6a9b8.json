We are given that the circumference is $12\\pi$, so we can set up the equation $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$ to solve for $r$.\nDividing both sides by $2\\pi$, we get $r = 6$.\nThe area of a square with side length $r$ is $r^2$, so the area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.\nTherefore, the area of the square is $\\boxed{36}$ square units.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{36}$."
