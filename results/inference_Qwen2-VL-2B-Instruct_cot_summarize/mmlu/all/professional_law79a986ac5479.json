The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness \"I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.\nB. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\nC. Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.\nD. Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.\n"

                    "text": "The court will likely sustain the objection.\n\nThe key point here is that the prosecutor's witness is attempting to impeach the accused by showing that the perpetrator had a prior relationship with the child and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. This is a type of impeachment, which is allowed in court to challenge the credibility of the witness. The prosecutor's witness is also a party admission, which is also allowed in court to show material facts of the case.\n\nTherefore, the statement is relevant to the issue of guilt or innocence because it challenges the credibility of the witness and provides material facts about the perpetrator's relationship with the child and the family's financial situation. The statement is not irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence, as it provides evidence that could be used to impeach the witness's credibility and establish the perpetrator's guilt.\n\nThus, the court is likely to sustain the objection.\n\nFinal answer: B. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money."
