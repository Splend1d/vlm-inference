On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following best explains Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" in China?\n\nA. Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers.\nB. Agricultural surpluses allowed the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production.\nC. Agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities, raising the standard of living across the whole of China.\nD. Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this logic reasoning problem, we need to understand the context and the core of Mao Zedong's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" as presented in the given passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the growing polarization in the countryside due to the capitalist forces, with new rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants, while many poor peasants remain in poverty. Mao argues that this trend will exacerbate the situation and that the worker-peasant alliance cannot continue to stand in these circumstances.\n\nMao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" aims to address this issue by advocating for a gradual transition to socialism. This involves:\n\n1. **Eliminating the rich-peasant economy**: By eliminating the capitalist forces, the state can control the distribution of land and resources, ensuring that all rural people become increasingly well-off together.\n\n2. **Co-operation and elimination of the individual economy**: This means transitioning from a system where individuals own the land and resources to one where entire communities share fields, reducing the individual ownership of land and resources.\n\n3. **Socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce**: This involves transitioning from a capitalist system to a socialist one, where the state takes over the management of these industries and commerce.\n\nGiven this context, the best explanation of Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" is:\n\nD. Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.\n\nThis option directly aligns with Mao's goal of transitioning from a capitalist to a socialist agricultural system, where the state takes control of land and resources, reducing individual ownership and promoting collective ownership and collective management."
