After settling with the hotel, the guest sued the manufacturer of the carpet that was in her room and elsewhere in the hotel. The carpet caused the fire to spread rapidly due to its easy flammability. Evidence proved that the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. How did the trial court most likely rule on that issue?\n\nA. The intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability.\nB. The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\nC. The intervening causes were irrelevant due to the strict liability of the manufacturer.\nD. By not suing the arsonist first, the guest waived her right to sue the manufacturer.\n"

                    "text": "The trial court most likely ruled on the issue of intervening causes by considering the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Case**: The case involves a fire caused by an arsonist, which is a criminal act. The hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist are both considered intervening causes because they occurred after the fire started.\n\n2. **Superseding Causes**: The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. This argument would be based on the doctrine of abatement of liability, which states that if a party's negligence or criminal act is superseding, the manufacturer's liability is abrogated.\n\n3. **Superseding Causes**: The doctrine of abatement of liability requires that the intervening cause must be the primary cause of the injury or damage. In this case, the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were the primary causes of the fire, which spread rapidly due to the carpet's flammability.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were the primary causes of the fire, the doctrine of abatement of liability would not apply, and the manufacturer would not be relieved of liability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability."
