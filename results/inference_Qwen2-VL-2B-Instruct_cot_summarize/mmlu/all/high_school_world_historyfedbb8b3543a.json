If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nWhat was the impact of European demand for Chinese goods?\n\nA. The Portuguese increased their international power and prestige.\nB. The British shifted their focus for trade and colonization to Japan.\nC. The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.\nD.

The emperor's response is that he does not have any interest in strange and costly objects, and he has no use for English manufactures. He emphasizes the importance of submission to the Chinese throne for peace and prosperity.\n\nThe impact of European demand for Chinese goods is not directly mentioned in the passage. However, it is possible that the passage implies that the Chinese emperor's response to the envoys' requests was a response to the growing European demand for Chinese goods, which could have led to increased trade and colonization in the region.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China."
