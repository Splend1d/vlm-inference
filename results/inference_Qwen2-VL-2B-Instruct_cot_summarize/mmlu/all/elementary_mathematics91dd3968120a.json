This means for every 7 parts of the salad dressing (2 parts vinegar + 5 parts oil), 1 part is oil.\n\nGiven that we have 9 ounces of vinegar, we can set up the proportion as follows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\text{ parts vinegar}}{5 \\text{ parts oil}} = \\frac{9 \\text{ parts vinegar}}{x \\text{ parts oil}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) (the amount of oil), we get:\n\n\\[ 2x = 9 \\times 5 \\]\n\n\\[ 2x = 45 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{45}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 22.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, 22.5 ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 22.5."
