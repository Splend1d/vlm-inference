Lightly touch the guitar string in the middle such that a single node is created. Measure the length of the string; this is the wavelength.\nB. Measure the length of the guitar string; this is half the wavelength.\nC. Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.\nD. Measure the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes; this is the wavelength.\n"

Measure the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes; this is the wavelength.\n\nThis method is based on the fact that the wavelength of a sound wave is the distance between two consecutive points on the wave that have the same amplitude. By measuring the peak-to-peak distance of the wave, you can determine the distance between these points, which is the wavelength of the sound wave."
