While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?\n\nA. Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nB. Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nC. Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.\nD. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.\n\nLight adaptation is a process by which the retina responds to dim light by increasing the sensitivity of the photoreceptors (rods and cones) to light. This process is crucial for vision in dim light because it allows the retina to detect and process light signals more effectively. Without light adaptation, the retina would not be able to detect the faint light necessary for vision in dim light, leading to the inability to distinguish colors.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for why Lizette cannot see color in dim light is:\n\nD. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light."
