The water table would be found at an elevation higher than 550 feet above sea level but many feet below the land surface.\n\nWhen someone drills on the top of the hill, the water table will be found at an elevation higher than 550 feet above sea level but many feet below the land surface. This is because the water table is typically found at a depth that is several feet below the surface, and the top of the hill is at a much higher elevation than this depth."
