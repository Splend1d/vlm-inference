The boiling point of palladium is higher than nickel, indicating that it is more difficult to condense a palladium atom compared to a nickel atom.\n\nGiven these factors, the ionization energy of palladium should be higher than nickel, and the boiling point of palladium should be higher than nickel.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. -200 kJ/mol and 3524 \u00b0C\n- The ionization energy of palladium is higher than nickel, but the boiling point is lower than nickel.
