The activists are waging an intense internet campaign against the practice. Your utility has overwhelming evidence of the health benefits to fluoridated water. The manager of the utility asks you to initiate a blog to get the health message out. What is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA. Use utility employees to write the blog, posing as dentists and physicians.\nB. Recruit a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities with no reference to the utility.\nC. Write the blog yourself, identifying yourself as an employee of the utility, and quote the scientific opinions of a variety of sources.\nD.
