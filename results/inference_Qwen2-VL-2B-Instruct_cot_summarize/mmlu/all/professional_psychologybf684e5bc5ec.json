The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The criterion for statistical significance is set to 0.05, which means that the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (type I error) is 0.05.\n- The statistical power is equal to 0.85, which means that the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (type II error) is also 0.85.\n\nSince the statistical power is equal to the probability of making a type II error, the probability of making a type II error is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of making a type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true) is 0.15.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The probability of making a type I error is 0.15.\nB. The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.\nC. The probability of making a type II error is 0.85.\nD. The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given."
