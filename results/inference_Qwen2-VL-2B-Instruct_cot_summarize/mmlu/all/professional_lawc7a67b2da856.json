Tomato growers in a second state wish to ship tomatoes for sale into the first state but its tomatoes are in compliance only with the federal standards. The tomato growers' association in the second state brought an injunctive action in federal court against the agricultural department of the first state to enjoin enforcement of the genetic engineering rule on the basis of federal preemption. According to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, how will the courts decide the preemption claim?\n\nA. There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\nB. The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\nC. When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.\nD. The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\n"

Preemption occurs when a federal law takes precedence over a state law, and the state law is preempted if it conflicts with the federal law.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\n- This option suggests that the first state's law does not conflict with the federal law, and both can be complied with simultaneously. However, the problem specifically mentions that the first state's law prohibits the transportation or sale of tomatoes with more than 10% genetic engineering factor, while the federal standards do not mention genetic engineering factors. This indicates that the first state's law is preempted by the federal law.\n\nB. The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\n- This option suggests that the injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are compliant with federal standards will not need to be approved under the first state's law. However, the problem states that the tomatoes in compliance with federal standards are still subject to the first state's law.\n\nC. When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.\n- This option suggests that federal laws always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted because the first state's law conflicts with federal law. However, the problem specifically states that the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\n\nD. The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\n- This option suggests that the first state's law interferes impermissibly with the second state's law, and therefore the first state's law is preempted. However, the problem does not mention any interference between the two laws.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously."
