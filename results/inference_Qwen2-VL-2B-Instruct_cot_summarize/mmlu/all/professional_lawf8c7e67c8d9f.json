When he became chronically ill and could not care for himself, his unmarried daughter moved into his home to take care of him. As time went on, the widower became senile, lost touch with reality, and required continuous care. When that happened, the caretaking daughter made out a deed to herself as grantee and had him sign as grantor. He was not aware of what he was doing when he signed it. After the widower died, the two married children sued to have the deed set aside for mental incompetence. Assuming they can prove the foregoing allegations, will the court likely strike down the deed?\n\nA. No, because the caretaking daughter had a right to the property in return for all of the work that she performed.\nB. No, because every deed is strongly presumed to be valid when signed.\nC. Yes, because he did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of his act or the meaning of the legal instrument he signed.a\nD. Yes, because it was obtained by mutual mistake.\n"

The key issue here is whether the deed was obtained by the caretaking daughter through a mutual mistake, which would render it invalid.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Mutual Mistake**: The deed was obtained by mutual mistake, meaning both parties were unaware of the true nature of the transaction. If the caretaking daughter signed the deed without the consent of the grantor (the widower), it would be considered a mutual mistake.\n\n2. **Legal Capacity**: The grantor (the widower) was not aware of what he was signing when he signed the deed. This lack of awareness would render the deed invalid under the doctrine of incapacity.\n\n3. **Legal Capacity**: The grantor (the widower) was not mentally competent when he signed the deed. This incapacity would also render the deed invalid.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to strike down the deed as it was obtained through a mutual mistake and the grantor was not mentally competent when he signed it. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because he did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of his act or the meaning of the legal instrument he signed."
