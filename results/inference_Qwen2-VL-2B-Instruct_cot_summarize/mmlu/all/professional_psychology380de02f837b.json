It is crucial to ensure that the study's purpose is clear and transparent to participants to avoid any potential harm or deception.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"do not have to be told the true purpose as long as the use of deception is justified by\"\n- This option suggests that the true purpose of the study can be kept hidden if the deception is justified. This is not necessarily the best approach as it could lead to participants feeling misled or deceived, which might affect their participation and the study's credibility.\n\nB. \"do not have to be told the true purpose unless not to do so is likely to cause them substantial psychological harm.\"\n- This option suggests that the true purpose should not be revealed unless it is likely to cause substantial psychological harm. This is a reasonable approach as it ensures that participants are not misled or deceived in a way that could cause psychological harm.\n\nC. \"should be debriefed about the true purpose as soon as possible after their participation.\"\n- This option suggests that debriefing should occur immediately after participation. While this is a reasonable approach to ensure transparency and prevent deception, it might not be necessary if the deception is justified and the true purpose is clear.\n\nD. \"must be debriefed about the true purpose immediately after their participation.\"\n- This option suggests that debriefing should occur immediately after participation. This is the most stringent approach as it ensures that participants are informed about the true purpose of the study, which is crucial for their participation and the study's credibility.\n\nConsidering the context and the need for transparency and trust, the best approach is:\n\nB. \"do not have to be told the true purpose unless not to do so is likely to cause them substantial psychological harm.\"\n\nThis option ensures that the true purpose of the study is communicated to participants, which is essential for their participation and the study's credibility."
