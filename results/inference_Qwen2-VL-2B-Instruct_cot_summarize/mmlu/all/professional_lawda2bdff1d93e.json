In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.\nB. prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.\nC. not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.\nD. not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\n"

This failure to warn constitutes a breach of duty of care, which is a legal principle that holds individuals responsible for their actions or omissions that cause harm to others.\n\nGiven this understanding, the third friend should prevail in the case of a cause of action against the second friend. The third friend's failure to warn the second friend is a breach of duty, and as a result, the third friend is held liable for the injury caused by the first friend's action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury."
