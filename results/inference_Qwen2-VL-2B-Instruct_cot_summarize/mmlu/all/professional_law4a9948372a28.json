In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?\n\nA. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\nB. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.\nC. No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine whether the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in the case.\n\n1. **Understanding the General Warranty Deed**: The grantee conveyed a general warranty deed representing a vacant parcel of land to the purchaser. This means that the grantee was responsible for the condition of the land, including the paving of the road abutting the property. The grantee and her assigns were required to share proportionately in the paving of the road.\n\n2. **Special Warranty Deed**: The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by a special warranty deed. This deed did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. Therefore, the special warranty deed did not impose any obligation on the married couple to share in the paving of the road.\n\n3. **Title Search and Attorney**: The married couple did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. This lack of due diligence could potentially affect the validity of their claim.\n\n4. **Equity Claim**: The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. This indicates that the court considered the paving requirement to be a condition of the grantee's warranty deed.\n\nGiven these points, we can analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the covenant running with the land is intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns.\" However, the special warranty deed does not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. Therefore, this option is not supported by the facts of the case.\n\n- **Option B**: This option suggests that the landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads. This is not relevant to the specific case at hand, as the paving requirement was not placed in the deed to the married couple.\n\n- **Option C**: This option suggests that the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser. However, the special warranty deed did not impose any obligation on the married couple to share in the paving of the road. Therefore, this option is not supported by the facts of the case.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not. This is supported by the facts of the case, as the special warranty deed did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most supported option is:\n\n**D. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **D**."
