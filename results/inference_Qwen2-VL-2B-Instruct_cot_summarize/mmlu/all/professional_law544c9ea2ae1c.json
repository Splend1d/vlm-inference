He immediately sent a purchase order which stated \"our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF.\"\u009d Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated \"Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes.\" If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:\n\nA. A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.\nB. A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.\nC. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\nD. No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n"

No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Offer and Counteroffer**: The purchase order is a counteroffer to the Costco's offer. The purchase order specifies that the loading charge is to be included, which is a condition for the acceptance of the offer.\n\n2. **Mirror Image Rule**: The mirror image rule states that if an offer is accepted, the contract is formed. If an offer is rejected, the contract is not formed. In this case, the purchase order is a counteroffer to the Costco's offer, and the Costco's offer is conditional on the loading charge being included.\n\n3. **Acceptance**: The purchase order states that the envelope order acceptance is conditional on the loading charge being included. This means that the Costco's offer is not accepted unless the loading charge is included.\n\n4. **No Contract Formation**: Since the purchase order is a counteroffer and the Costco's offer is conditional on the loading charge being included, the parties cannot agree on the contract terms. Therefore, the purchase order does not form a contract.\n\nThus, the court would likely rule that there is no contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, cannot be deviated from."
