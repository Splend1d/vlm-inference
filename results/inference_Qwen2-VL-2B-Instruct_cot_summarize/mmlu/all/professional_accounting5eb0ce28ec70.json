First year depreciation: 20.00%\n2. Second year depreciation: 32.00%\n3. Third year depreciation: 19.20%\n\nTotal depreciation for the current year:\n\\[ 20.00\\% + 32.00\\% + 19.20\\% = 71.20\\% \\]\n\nTo convert this percentage to a decimal:\n\\[ 71.20\\% = 0.7120 \\]\n\nNow, we multiply this percentage by the cost of the equipment:\n\\[ 0.7120 \\times 10,000 = 7,120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of depreciation Baker can deduct in the current year is $7,120.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. $533"
