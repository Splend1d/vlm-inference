A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?\n\nA. Chance of a type I error\nB. Chance of a type II error\nC.

This is because the power of a study is inversely proportional to the sample size. Therefore, if the sample size is reduced, the study will be less likely to detect a true effect if it exists. This would increase the chance of a type I error (false positive) and decrease the chance of a type II error (false negative)."
