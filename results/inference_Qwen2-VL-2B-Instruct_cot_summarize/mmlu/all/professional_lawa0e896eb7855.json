The land conveyed to the woman fronted on a public highway. The land retained by the man was landlocked. One year later, the man died intestate, leaving a cousin as his only heir. The cousin visited the man's land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to a public highway. A neighbor who owned adjoining land fronting on the public highway offered to sell the cousin a right to cross the neighbor's land for access to the highway. Although the neighbor's price was reasonable, the cousin rejected the offer. The woman has refused to allow the cousin to cross her land for access to the public highway even though the woman's land is still vacant. The cousin has sued the woman, seeking access across the woman's land to the public highway. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity.\nB. The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\nC. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\nD. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n"

                    "text": "The decision to grant access to a public highway will depend on the terms of the warranty deed and the legal principles governing easements and conveyances of land.\n\n1. **Warranty Deed Terms**: The warranty deed conveyed the eastern half of the tract of vacant land to the woman. The deed did not specifically reserve an easement for access to the public highway. This means that the woman has the right to use the land for any purpose, including access to the public highway, but she has not specifically reserved an easement.\n\n2. **Legal Principles**: In many jurisdictions, a warranty deed does not automatically create an easement. An easement is a legal right that allows a person to cross another's land for access to a public highway. To create an easement, the grantor (the man in this case) must have specifically reserved such an easement in the deed.\n\n3. **Counseling**: The cousin has sued the woman, seeking access across the woman's land to the public highway. The cousin has not specifically reserved an easement in the deed. Therefore, the cousin is likely to prevail based on the principle that the grantor must have reserved an easement in the deed.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The cousin is likely to prevail because the man did not specifically reserve an easement in the deed, and the cousin has not specifically sought an easement from the woman. The cousin has the right to access the public highway through the neighbor's land, which the woman has not granted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.**"
