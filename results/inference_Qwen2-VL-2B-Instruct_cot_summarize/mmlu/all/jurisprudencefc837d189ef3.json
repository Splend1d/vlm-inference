Formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic reasoning.\n\nAmerican realists argued that formalism devalued the authority of the judge to make law because they believed that formalism treated legal reasoning as syllogistic reasoning, which is a type of logical reasoning that involves making a series of statements that logically follow from one another. This approach to legal reasoning was seen as flawed because it did not allow for the nuanced and complex reasoning that judges often need to make in order to reach just decisions."
