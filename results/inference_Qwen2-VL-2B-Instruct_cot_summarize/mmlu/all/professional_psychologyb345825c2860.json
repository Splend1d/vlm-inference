In this scenario, participants are offered two options: $1.00 or $20.00. If participants believe the experiment is dull, they might feel uncomfortable with the offer of $1.00, leading to a cognitive dissonance effect. Therefore, they might report a higher liking for the dull experiment.\n\n**Self-Perception Theory:**\nSelf-perception theory suggests that individuals form their own perceptions of their own behavior and attitudes. If participants believe the experiment is dull, they might perceive themselves as having done well by accepting the offer of $1.00, leading to a positive self-perception. Therefore, they might report a higher liking for the dull experiment.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.**"
