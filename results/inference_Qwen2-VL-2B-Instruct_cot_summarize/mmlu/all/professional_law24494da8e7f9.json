                    "text": "A police officer was employed on a city's police force for 10 years. When the officer accepted the job, the city's employee benefit plan provided a death benefit to the spouse of any employee who died as a result of any job-related injury. Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benefit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Because of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusion and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan. The officer's spouse has challenged the amendment, claiming that, as applied to the officer, it violated the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Is the court likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer?\n\nA. No, because it effectively discriminates against a religious practice.\nB. No, because it violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect.\nC. Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.\nD. Yes, because it imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court is likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer, we need to analyze the nature of the amendment and its impact on the officer's religious beliefs.\n\n1. **Nature of the Amendment**: The amendment states that the death benefit will be denied if the death was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician. This means that the denial of the benefit is based on the employee's refusal to accept medical care, which is a religious belief.\n\n2. **Impact on the Officer**: The amendment effectively discriminates against the officer's religious belief by denying the death benefit because of his refusal to accept medical care. This is a clear violation of the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the amendment effectively discriminates against a religious practice. While this might be true, it does not directly address the denial of the death benefit based on the officer's refusal to accept medical care.\n   - **Option B**: This option suggests that the amendment violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect. This is not relevant to the specific case of the officer.\n   - **Option C**: This option suggests that the amendment does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits. This is not accurate because the amendment specifically denies the benefit based on the officer's refusal to accept medical care, which is a religious belief.\n   - **Option D**: This option suggests that the amendment imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct. This is not accurate because the denial of the benefit is based on the officer's refusal to accept medical care, which is a religious belief.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate option is:\n\n**C. Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.**\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer."
