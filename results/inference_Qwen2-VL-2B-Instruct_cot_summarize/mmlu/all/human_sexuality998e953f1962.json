The sympathetic system is responsible for the release of hormones that help regulate blood flow and arousal. When Keith is anxious, the sympathetic system is suppressed, leading to decreased blood flow to the penis and reduced arousal. This is why Keith is having trouble getting an erection. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
