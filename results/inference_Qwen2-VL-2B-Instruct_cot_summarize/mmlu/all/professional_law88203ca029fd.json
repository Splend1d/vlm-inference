After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt. If the court rules in favor of the mechanic, which of the following is the most likely cause for such a ruling?\n\nA. The writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.\nB. The writing was construed as a partial integration of the parties' agreement.\nC. An implied-in-law contract was created at the moment the mechanic replaced the worn belt.\nD. The parties entered into a collateral oral agreement for the replacement of the worn belt that was excludable from the integrated writing.\n"

The writing was construed as a partial integration of the parties' agreement.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Partial Integration**: The court would likely interpret the written contract as a partial integration of the parties' agreement. This means that the written contract only covers the services that were explicitly mentioned in the contract, and any additional services (such as the replacement of the worn belt) would be considered an additional agreement or an implied-in-law contract.\n\n2. **Reasoning**: The court would consider the written contract as a complete agreement between the parties, and any additional services (such as the replacement of the worn belt) would be considered an additional agreement or an implied-in-law contract. The court would not consider the additional services to be part of the integrated contract.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: If the court rules in favor of the mechanic, it would likely be because the additional services (the replacement of the worn belt) were not explicitly mentioned in the written contract and were therefore considered an implied-in-law contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
