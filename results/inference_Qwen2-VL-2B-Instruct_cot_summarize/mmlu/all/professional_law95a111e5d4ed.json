                    "text": "To determine the most accurate statement regarding the ownership rights of the property, let's analyze the given grant clause:\n\nThe grant clause states: \"To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener.\"\n\n1. **Nephew's Life Estate**: The grant specifies that the nephew has a life estate. This means the nephew has the right to use, occupy, and dispose of the property during his lifetime.\n\n2. **Niece's Life Estate**: The grant also specifies that the niece has a life estate. This means the niece also has the right to use, occupy, and dispose of the property during her lifetime.\n\n3. **Gardener's Vested Remainder**: The grant states that the gardener has a vested remainder. This means the gardener has a right to the property after the nephew and niece's life estates have expired.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Joint Tenancy in Fee Simple Defeasible**: This option suggests that the nephew and niece are joint tenants in fee simple defeasible. However, the grant does not explicitly state that they are joint tenants. The grant only specifies that the nephew and niece have a life estate, which does not necessarily imply joint tenancy.\n\nB. **Life Estate, Life Estate Pur Aetere Vie, and Vested Remainder**: This option suggests that the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. This is not accurate because the grant does not specify that the niece has a life estate pur autre vie.\n\nC. **Tenants in Common for the Life of the First of Them to Die, Contingent Remainders in Fee Simple Defeasible, and Vested Remainder**: This option suggests that the nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first of them to die, with contingent remainders in fee simple defeasible, and the gardener has a vested remainder. This is not accurate because the grant does not specify that the niece has a contingent remainder.\n\nD. **Life Estate, Life Estate, and Vested Remainder**: This option suggests that the nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder. This is accurate because the grant specifies that the nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement regarding the ownership rights of the property is:\n\n**D. The nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.**"
