The seller answered the complaint and included as a separate defense an allegation that the purchaser had brought and lost a similar contract claim against a different seller three years earlier, and that this history represented a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits. The purchaser believes that the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one and is therefore irrelevant. What is the purchaser's best response to the seller's answer?\n\nA. File a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense.\nB. Move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense.\nC. Move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits.\nD. Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n"

Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n\nThis option is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the issue of the seller's defense that the purchaser's earlier lawsuit was factually different from the current one. By moving to strike the separate defense, the purchaser can effectively dismiss the seller's argument that the earlier lawsuit was frivolous and irrelevant to the current case. This action is a legal strategy to prevent the court from considering the earlier lawsuit as evidence in the current case, thereby ensuring that the court focuses on the current facts and issues in the case."
