The formula for BEY is:\n\n\\[ \\text{BEY} = \\frac{\\text{Bond Price}}{\\text{Bond Maturity}} \\times \\text{Bond Yield to Maturity} \\]\n\nGiven a $1,000 13-week US Treasury bill purchased for $960, we can calculate the BEY as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{BEY} = \\frac{\\$960}{13 \\text{ weeks}} \\times \\text{Bond Yield to Maturity} \\]\n\nSince the bond price is $960 and the bond maturity is 13 weeks, we can simplify the calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{BEY} = \\frac{960}{13} \\times \\text{Bond Yield to Maturity} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{BEY} = 72 \\times \\text{Bond Yield to Maturity} \\]\n\nTo find the closest option, we need to calculate the BEY for each option and compare it to 72:\n\nA. 16.0 percent: \\( 16.0 \\times 72 = 1152 \\)\nB. 16.7 percent: \\( 16.7 \\times 72 = 1180.4 \\)\nC. 17.0 percent: \\( 17.0 \\times 72 = 1204 \\)\nD. 17.8 percent: \\( 17.8 \\times 72 = 1231.6 \\)\n\nThe closest option to 1152 is 16.0 percent, which is option A.
