The stages of development are:\n\n1. Trust versus mistrust (birth to 2 years old)\n2. Autonomy versus shame and doubt (2 to 3 years old)\n3. Industry versus inferiority (3 to 5 years old)\n4. Initiative versus guilt (5 to 7 years old)\n5. Identity versus role confusion (7 to 11 years old)\n6. Intimacy versus isolation (11 to 18 years old)\n7. Generativity versus stagnation (18 to 30 years old)\n8. Penitence versus pride (30 to 65 years old)\n9. Transference versus regression (65 to 85 years old)\n\nThe stage of identity versus role confusion is the one that Erikson identified as the most crucial for the development of a sense of self and personal identity. If individuals do not successfully resolve this stage, they may experience feelings of confusion, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction with their lives, leading to feelings of despair and a lack of fulfillment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. identity versus role confusion"
