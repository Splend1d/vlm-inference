The employee then called the paramedics, who took the boss to the hospital. Two week later, the boss returned to work. Grateful for the employee's quick action in saving his life, the boss said to the employee, \"You'll have ajob with me for life. \"Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date?\n\nA. &s per the boss's oral promise, the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract.\nB.

However, the scenario does not explicitly state that the employee had a contract. The promise is more about gratitude rather than a formal employment agreement.\n\n   - **Option B:** \"The boss had a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, based upon a contract implied-in-fact.\"\n     - This option suggests that the boss had a duty to compensate the employee for saving his life, which is implied by the contract. However, the scenario does not provide enough information to conclude that there was a formal contract.\n\n   - **Option C:** \"The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise.\"\n     - This option suggests that the employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to make the boss's promise enforceable. This is plausible because the employee's act of saving the life was a significant event that could be considered past consideration.\n\n   - **Option D:** \"Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\"\n     - This option suggests that the employee's gratuitous assistance was not sufficient to support the boss's promise. However, the scenario does not provide enough information to conclude that the employee's assistance was gratuitous.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The scenario does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the employee had a lifetime employment contract or that the employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render the boss's promise enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the best characterizing legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date is:\n\n**Option C: The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise.**"
