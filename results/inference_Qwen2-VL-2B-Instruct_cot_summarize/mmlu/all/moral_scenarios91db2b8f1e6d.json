This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it could lead to significant harm to the environment and potentially to human life.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character washed their dirty kid with a washcloth dipped in soap. This action is not clearly morally wrong. Washing a child with soap is generally considered acceptable and necessary for hygiene purposes. It is not considered morally wrong unless there is a specific reason to believe that it is harmful to the child's health or well-being."
