                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability. Let's denote the probability of selecting a red marble as \\(P(R)\\) and the probability of selecting a blue marble as \\(P(B)\\). We are given that \\(P(R) = \\frac{4}{10}\\) and \\(P(B) = \\frac{6}{10}\\).\n\nThe probability of both events happening (selecting a red marble and then a blue marble) is the product of the probabilities of each event happening individually. Therefore, the probability of both events happening is:\n\n\\[P(R \\text{ and } B) = P(R) \\times P(B) = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{24}{100} = \\frac{6}{50} = \\frac{3}{25}\\]\n\nHowever, this is the probability of selecting a red marble and then a blue marble. To find the probability of both events happening in any order, we need to consider the total number of ways to select a marble and then another marble, which is the product of the number of ways to select a red marble and the number of ways to select a blue marble, and then the number of ways to select a red marble again, and so on. This is given by the formula:\n\n\\[P(R \\text{ and } B) = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{24}{100} = \\frac{6}{50} = \\frac{3}{25}\\]\n\nThis is the probability of selecting a red marble and then a blue marble, but it's not the probability of selecting a blue marble and then a red marble. To find the probability of selecting a blue marble and then a red marble, we simply need to consider the probability of selecting a blue marble first and then a red marble, which is the same as the probability of selecting a red marble first and then a blue marble, because the order of selection does not matter in this context.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events happening in any order is:\n\n\\[P(R \\text{ and } B) = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{24}{100} = \\frac{6}{50} = \\frac{3}{25}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)"
