The idea that the fall of one state to communism would inexorably lead to the fall of its neighbors\n\nThe \"Domino Theory\" was a concept developed by the US military during the Cold War to explain the rationale behind the Soviet Union's policy of containment. It posited that if one country fell to communism, it would inevitably lead to the collapse of its neighbors, creating a domino effect that would eventually bring down the entire Soviet bloc. This theory was used to justify the US military's intervention in Southeast Asia and other regions to prevent the spread of communism."
