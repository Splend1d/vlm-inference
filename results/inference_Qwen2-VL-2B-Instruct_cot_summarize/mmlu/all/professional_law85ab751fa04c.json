The law directs the state juvenile court to enter a termination order in such a case after the parent has been afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing at which the only relevant issues are the age of the child and whether the child has been convicted of a violent crime in the state. Is the state law constitutional?\n\nA. No, because the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial state interest.\nB. No, because the law is not necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\nC. Yes, because a state's police power authorizes it to punish criminal behavior with appropriate sanctions.\nD. Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n"

This process ensures that the court considers the age of the child and whether the child has been convicted of a violent crime.\n   - The law does not require the court to consider other factors, such as the parent's criminal history or the nature of the crime. This is a narrow and specific requirement that serves a substantial state interest.\n\n2. **Necessary to Serve a Substantial State Interest:**\n   - The law is necessary to address the steep increase in juvenile crime and to prevent further increases. By terminating the parental rights of parents who have convicted children of violent crimes, the state can reduce the number of violent crimes in the state and improve public safety.\n   - The law is not merely a means to an end but is an end in itself. It is designed to address the specific problem of juvenile crime.\n\nGiven that the law is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial state interest and is necessary to serve that interest, the state law is constitutional.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.**"
