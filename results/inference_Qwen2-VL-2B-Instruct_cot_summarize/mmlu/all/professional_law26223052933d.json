They signed a contract that said that if they purchased new items on the account, they would not own the old purchases until the new ones were paid in full. That provision was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers. When husband lost his job, they had by that time paid for everything purchased on the account except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. The store sued, trying to repossess all furniture ever sold to the couple. Will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?\n\nA. No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.\nB. No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit, and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it.\nC. Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.\nD. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n"

This provision is in fine print on the reverse side of the papers.\n\n2. **Context of the Situation**: The couple lost their job, and they had already paid for everything purchased on the account except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. This means that the couple has already paid for the old purchases, and the new purchases are still outstanding.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Defense**: The defense of unconscionability typically hinges on the seller's intent and the terms of the contract. If the seller had a motive to deceive the couple into signing the contract, or if the terms were unreasonable, the court might find that the contract was unconscionable.\n\n4. **Evaluation of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.\"\n     - This option suggests that the couple could find another store to sell them furniture, which would negate the need for the court to consider the terms of the contract. This does not address the issue of the terms themselves being unreasonable or the seller's intent.\n   - **Option B**: \"No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit, and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it.\"\n     - This option suggests that the couple should have known that they would not own the old purchases until the new ones were paid in full. However, it does not address the specific terms of the contract and the court's interpretation of those terms.\n   - **Option C**: \"Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.\"\n     - This option suggests that the terms of the contract are unreasonable and that the seller had a motive to deceive the couple. However, it does not address the specific context of the situation where the couple already paid for the old purchases.\n   - **Option D**: \"Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\"\n     - This option acknowledges that the terms of the contract are unreasonable and that the couple already paid for the old purchases. It also considers the context of the situation where the couple lost their job and had already paid for everything except for one chair. This suggests that the court might find that the terms of the contract are unconscionable.\n\nGiven the context and the specific terms of the contract, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.**"
