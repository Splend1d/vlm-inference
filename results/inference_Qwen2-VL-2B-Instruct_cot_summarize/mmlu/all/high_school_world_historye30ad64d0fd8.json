And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously?\n\nA. The genealogy is derived from the maternal side.\nB. They study Islamic law faithfully.\nC. The men do not yield to sexual jealousy.\nD. They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender.\n"

This shows that they are actively engaged in learning and following the teachings of Islam, which is a significant aspect of their faith.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Sexual Jealousy**: The passage states that \"As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them.\" This indicates that the Malians are committed to maintaining a healthy and respectful relationship with their partners, which is a hallmark of a serious faith.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Traveling with the Husband**: The passage mentions that \"If one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family.\" This suggests that the Malians have a strong sense of family and community, which is a strong indication of their seriousness in their faith.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously is:\n\n**B. They study Islamic law faithfully.**"
