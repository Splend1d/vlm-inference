The major site of fatty acid \u00df-oxidation is the peroxisomes, the mitochondria also contain enzymes for this pathway\nB. Within the liver peroxisomes serve to oxidise very long chain fatty acids to medium chain products\nC. The rate of b-oxidation is regulated by the availability of fatty acids and the rate of utilisation of b-oxidation products\nD. Peroxisomes are the site for the degradation of xenobiotics and eicosanoids\n"

Peroxisomes are involved in the degradation of fatty acids and other lipids, but they do not degrade xenobiotics or eicosanoids."
