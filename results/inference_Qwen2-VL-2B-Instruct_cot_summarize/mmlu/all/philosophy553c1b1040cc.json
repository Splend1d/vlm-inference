This is because Kant's ethics are based on the idea that moral worthiness is a finite set of constraints, which means that there are certain moral values that are considered to be more important than others. If we interpret Kant's ethics in this way, it would mean that there are certain moral values that are more important than others, and that these values should be considered when making moral decisions. This would make the theory too demanding, as it would require that we consider all possible moral values when making decisions. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
