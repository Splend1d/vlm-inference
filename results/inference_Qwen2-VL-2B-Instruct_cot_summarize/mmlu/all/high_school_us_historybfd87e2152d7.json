Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nGiven the perspective of the passage above, William Hickling Prescott believed which of the following about the conquest of the Aztec Empire?\n\nA. The actions of Hernando Cortes were irrational.\nB. The conquest of Mexico was a racist atrocity.\nC. Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth.\nD. The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n"

Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth.\n\nWilliam Hickling Prescott's perspective on the conquest of the Aztec Empire is that Hernando Cortes was primarily driven by a desire for wealth. He believed that Cortes' enterprise was a result of his own genius and that he was a great general who achieved great achievements with the resources he created. Prescott emphasizes that Cortes' success was due to his ability to bring together a diverse group of mercenaries, adventurers, and native allies, all of whom shared a common goal of wealth."
