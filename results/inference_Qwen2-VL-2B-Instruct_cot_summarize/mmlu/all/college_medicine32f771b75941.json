The equation is already balanced as it stands.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of ethane and oxygen required for the reaction to occur:\n\n- For ethane (C2H4):\n  \\[ \\text{Moles of C2H4} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of C2H4}}{\\text{Molar mass of C2H4}} = \\frac{84\\text{ g}}{28\\text{ g/mol}} = 3\\text{ mol} \\]\n\n- For oxygen (O2):\n  \\[ \\text{Moles of O2} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of O2}}{\\text{Molar mass of O2}} = \\frac{84\\text{ g}}{32\\text{ g/mol}} = 2.625\\text{ mol} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the moles of carbon dioxide produced:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of CO}_2 = \\text{Moles of C}_2\\text{H}_4 \\times \\frac{\\text{Moles of CO}_2}{\\text{Moles of C}_2\\text{H}_4} = 3\\text{ mol} \\times \\frac{1\\text{ mol CO}_2}{2\\text{ mol C}_2\\text{H}_4} = 1.5\\text{ mol CO}_2 \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the moles of carbon dioxide to grams using the molar mass of carbon dioxide (12 amu/mol):\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of CO}_2 = \\text{Moles of CO}_2 \\times \\text{Molar mass of CO}_2 = 1.5\\text{ mol} \\times 12\\text{ amu/mol} = 18\\text{ g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of carbon dioxide produced when 84 grams of ethane reacts with unlimited oxygen is 18 grams.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 156g"
