                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage?\n\nA. The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine which later development would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage, we need to analyze each option in the context of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the challenges and potential solutions for the worker-peasant alliance in the countryside. It emphasizes the need for a socialist transformation of agriculture, industrialization, and handicrafts, and the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.**\n   - This option suggests economic growth, which could potentially improve the living conditions of peasants and contribute to the stability of the worker-peasant alliance. However, it does not directly address the core issue of the transformation of the countryside.\n\nB. **Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.**\n   - This option highlights a historical event that could have negative consequences for China's economic and political stability, potentially affecting the alliance and the transformation of the countryside. However, it does not directly address the core issue of the transformation of the countryside.\n\nC. **The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.**\n   - This option directly addresses the core issue of the transformation of the countryside. The passage emphasizes the need for a socialist transformation of agriculture, industrialization, and handicrafts, which would likely lead to the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economy. The famine and poverty mentioned in this option would undermine the hopes expressed by Mao.\n\nD. **Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution.**\n   - This option discusses a political event that could have negative consequences for the stability of the Communist Party and the alliance. However, it does not directly address the core issue of the transformation of the countryside.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option C directly addresses the core issue of the transformation of the countryside, which would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage.\n\nFinal answer: C. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry."
