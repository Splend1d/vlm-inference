Although\\he driver immediately applied his brakes and swerved to avoid the girl, the cat hit the girl, fracturing her legs. As the girl was lying in the street awaiting an ambulance, the driver rushed over to her and said: \"Im terribly sorry. This is the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault. Send me all your hospital bills. I'fl pay for everything. \"When the girl was later released from the hospital, her parents contacted the driver who refused to pay anything. The driver told the girl's mother, \"Since your daughter ran into the street, it was her fault. I have witnesses who saw what she did. If I weren't such a nice guy, I'd sue you for the damage to my new car. \"If the girl's parents, on her behalf, sue the driver in tort, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the driver's post-accident statements?\n\nA.

This means that the driver's actions were the proximate cause of the girl's injuries.\n\n2. **Vicarious Liability**: The driver is also liable for the girl's injuries because he was the owner of the car and had the duty to ensure the safety of the girl while driving.\n\nGiven these principles, the driver's statements can be evaluated as follows:\n\n- **Statement Regarding Operation of the Car**: This statement is admissible because it is a factual statement about the driver's actions. It is not a subjective or opinion-based statement, and it is relevant to the issue of negligence.\n\n- **Statement Concerning Payment of the Hospital Bills**: This statement is not admissible because it is a subjective statement about the driver's intentions or actions. It is not relevant to the issue of negligence and is not a factual statement about the driver's actions.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement regarding the driver's post-accident statements is:\n\n**C. The driver's statement regarding his operation of the car is admissible on the issue of negligence, but his statement concerning payment of the hospital bills is not admissible in accordance with public policy considerations.**"
