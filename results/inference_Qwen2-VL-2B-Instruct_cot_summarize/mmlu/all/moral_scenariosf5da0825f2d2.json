This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves the intentional and deliberate endangerment of a child's life. In scenario 2, the main character is planning on adding booze to the punch drink without anyone known. This is not considered morally wrong, as it is a common practice in social gatherings and does not involve any intentional harm to others."
