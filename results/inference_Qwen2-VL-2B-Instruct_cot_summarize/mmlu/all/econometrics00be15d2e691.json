For example, the variables can be cointegrated even if one is non-stationary.\n- Statement ii) is false because the cointegrating relationship does not guarantee that only one linear combination of the variables will be stationary. It is possible for both variables to be cointegrated with different linear combinations of them being stationary.\n- Statement iii) is true because the cointegrating equation for $x_t$ and $y_t$ describes the long-run relationship between the two series.\n- Statement iv) is false because the residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ must be stationary if the cointegrating relationship is to hold. If the residuals are not stationary, then the cointegrating relationship may not hold."
