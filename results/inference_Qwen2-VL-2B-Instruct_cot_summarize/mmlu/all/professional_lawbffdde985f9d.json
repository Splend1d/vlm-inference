The first item the man put up for bid was an antique Baldwin grand piano. The man announced that the bidding would be \"without reserve\" and said, \"What's the opening bid on this beautiful Baldwin grand piano?\" A woman opened the bidding with $100. The man then commented, \"This piano is worth at least $5,000. What other bids am I offered?\" When the man did not receive any other bids, he informed the woman that he would not accept $100 and was removing the piano from the sale. If the woman asserts an action against the man for breach of contract, the woman will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because goods put up at an auction \"without reserve\" may not be withdrawn.\nB. prevail, because whether or not the auction is \"without reserve,\" goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids.\nC. not prevail, because at an auction \"without reserve,\" the auctioneer may withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale.\nD. not prevail, because at an auction \"without reserve,\" the auctioneer invites offers, which he may accept or reject.\n"

Instead, the auctioneer invites offers from the bidders. The auctioneer may accept or reject any offer, and the goods are sold to the highest bidder at the end of the auction.\n\n2. **Bidding Without Reserve**: The man's advertisement explicitly states that the auction is \"without reserve,\" meaning the goods are sold to the highest bidder at the end of the auction. This means that the goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids.\n\n3. **Action Against the Man for Breach of Contract**: If the woman asserts an action against the man for breach of contract, she is most likely to prevail because the auction is \"without reserve,\" and the auctioneer cannot withdraw the goods after the auctioneer calls for bids. The auctioneer's role is to invite offers and accept the highest bid, and the goods cannot be withdrawn until the auction is completed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
