The buyer later stopped the seller from continuing to use the strip for travel because no road had been constructed. The landowner sued the buyer, claiming that he still owned the forty-foot strip of land because it was not conveyed in the deed and was at best ambiguously stated. Will the court consider the outside evidence that the parties intended this to be a right-of-way over the buyer's land?\n\nA. No, the court will confine itself to what is in the four corners of the deed.\nB. No, because that would violate the parole evidence rule.\nC. Yes, because the court always has a right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation of what it means.\nD. Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court will consider the outside evidence that the parties intended this to be a right-of-way over the buyer's land, we need to analyze the context and the relevant legal principles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The deed states that the landowner retains an absolute right to travel over the strip of land for certain purposes. The buyer stopped the seller from continuing to use the strip for travel because no road had been constructed. This suggests that the buyer intended to use the strip as a right-of-way.\n\n2. **Parole Evidence Rule**: The parole evidence rule is a principle that allows the court to consider evidence of the parties' intentions if it is relevant to the interpretation of the deed. However, it is not a general rule that allows the court to consider outside evidence to reform the deed.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A: No, the court will confine itself to what is in the four corners of the deed.**\n     - This option suggests that the court will only consider the four corners of the deed, which is not the correct interpretation of the question. The deed does not limit the court's ability to consider outside evidence.\n   - **Option B: No, because that would violate the parole evidence rule.**\n     - This option suggests that the court would not consider outside evidence because it would violate the parole evidence rule. However, the question does not specifically mention the parole evidence rule.\n   - **Option C: Yes, because the court always has a right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation of what it means.**\n     - This option suggests that the court has the authority to reform the deed based on its interpretation of the parties' intentions. This is not the correct interpretation of the question.\n   - **Option D: Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.**\n     - This option suggests that the court can consider outside evidence to supplement the four corners of the deed and determine the true intention of the parties. This is the correct interpretation of the question.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.**"
