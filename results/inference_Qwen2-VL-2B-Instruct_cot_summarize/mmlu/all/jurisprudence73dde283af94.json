This means that a sanction is the smallest amount of harm that can be expected to result from a command.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. All commands include some sanction.\n- This statement is consistent with Austin's argument. If a command is a sanction, then it includes some form of punishment or consequence.\n\nB. The concept of a command contains the likelihood that a sanction will follow failure to obey the command.\n- This statement is also consistent with Austin's argument. If a command is a sanction, then it implies that there is a probability of a sanction being imposed for failure to obey the command.\n\nC. Without a sanction the mere expression of a wish is not a command.\n- This statement is not directly related to Austin's argument. Austin's argument focuses on the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil, not on the nature of commands themselves.\n\nD. A command confers power to change one's legal status.\n- This statement is not directly related to Austin's argument. Austin's argument is about the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil, not about the consequences of commands.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is the least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument is:\n\nC. Without a sanction the mere expression of a wish is not a command.\n\nFinal answer: C."
