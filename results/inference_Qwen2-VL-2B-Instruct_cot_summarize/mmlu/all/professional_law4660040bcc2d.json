One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for\n\nA. Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\nB. Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.\nC. Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n"

This doctrine is generally applied when the dog is not under the control of the owner and has a history of biting or attacking people.\n\nGiven the facts provided:\n\n1. The dog, Rover, was a good, friendly dog who loved to run and chase cars but had never hurt anyone.\n2. Ginny, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog, causing her to suffer a head injury.\n3. The strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n\nSince the dog, Rover, had a history of biting and attacking people, it is likely that the court will find for Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities."
