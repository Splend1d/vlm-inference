While SVMs are known for their ability to find a hypothesis that is globally optimal in the sense that it minimizes the maximum margin, it is not guaranteed that the hypothesis found will be the globally optimal one. There can be multiple local optima, and the SVM algorithm does not guarantee to find the global optimum.\n\nStatement 2: After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space (though we can\u2019t guarantee this).\n- This statement is true. The radial basis kernel function allows the Perceptron to learn in a higher-dimensional space, which can potentially improve its performance. However, it is not guaranteed that this will always happen, and the performance can vary depending on the specific data and kernel used.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
