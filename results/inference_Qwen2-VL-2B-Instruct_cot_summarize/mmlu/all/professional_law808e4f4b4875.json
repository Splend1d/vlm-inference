The other woman did not know that her partner had a gun in the shopping bag. After the women placed three dresses into the shopping bag, a clerk became suspicious and approached the women. The women tried to leave the store and, as they did, the clerk grabbed the bag, which fell to the floor. When the bag hit the floor, the gun discharged, killing the clerk. Which of the following would be the women's best defense to the charge of felony murder?\n\nA. They committed a larceny by placing the three dresses in the shopping bag.\nB. The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\nD. The killing, was accidental and unintended.\n"

                    "text": "The women's best defense to the charge of felony murder would be:\n\nC. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\n\nThe agency theory of felony murder holds that the death of a law enforcement officer or a person who is killed as a result of the commission of a crime is considered a felony murder. This theory is based on the idea that the death of a law enforcement officer is a result of the commission of a crime, and therefore, the crime itself is considered a felony.\n\nIn this case, the killing of the clerk was accidental and unintended, which would not meet the criteria for felony murder under the agency theory. However, the women's actions of placing the dresses in the shopping bag and then attempting to leave the store could still be considered a larceny, which is a separate crime. The jurisdiction would likely view the larceny as the primary offense, and the killing of the clerk would be considered a felony murder if the agency theory applies.\n\nTherefore, the best defense would be to argue that the killing of the clerk was accidental and unintended, and that the women's actions of placing the dresses in the shopping bag and attempting to leave the store were separate crimes."
