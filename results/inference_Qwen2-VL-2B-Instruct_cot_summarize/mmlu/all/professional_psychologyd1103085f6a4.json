Inhibition co-conditioning is encountered\n\nInhibition co-conditioning refers to the phenomenon where a behavior is suppressed when it is paired with an aversive stimulus, even if the aversive stimulus is not present. This can make it difficult to teach a new behavior through aversive techniques because the behavior may be suppressed even when it is not being punished."
