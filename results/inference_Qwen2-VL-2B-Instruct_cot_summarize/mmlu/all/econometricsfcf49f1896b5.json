(i) and (iii) only.\n\nThe ARCH(q) model is likely to be the more parsimonious because it only requires one parameter (q) to capture the dependence in the conditional variance. The GARCH(1,1) model, on the other hand, requires two parameters (1 for the ARCH part and 1 for the GARCH part) to capture the dependence in the conditional variance. Therefore, the ARCH(q) model is generally considered to be more parsimonious.\n\nThe ARCH(q) model is the more likely to violate non-negativity constraints because it does not impose any constraints on the conditional variance. The GARCH(1,1) model, on the other hand, does impose non-negativity constraints on the conditional variance.\n\nThe ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance, which is not the case for the GARCH(1,1) model."
