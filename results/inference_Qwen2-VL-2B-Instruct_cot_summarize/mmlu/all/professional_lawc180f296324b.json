By entering into the contract as written, the photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\n- This statement is accurate. The contract specifies that the photographer must produce a minimum of six acceptable photographs by August 15, and the payment is contingent on the mother's cooperation. The photographer is assuming the risk that the mother will not cooperate.\n\nB. The mother was under an implied duty to act in good faith to reasonably cooperate with the photographer in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\n- This statement is accurate. The contract implies that the mother has an implied duty to reasonably cooperate with the photographer. If the mother fails to cooperate, it would be a breach of the implied duty.\n\nC. An implied condition of the photographer's duty of performance was that the mother reasonably cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\n- This statement is accurate. The implied condition is that the mother reasonably cooperate, which is a part of the implied duty.\n\nD. The mother's refusal to cooperate reasonably in arranging for the taking of the photographs would excuse the photographer from further obligation under the contract and also give the photographer a right of action against the mother for breach of contract.\n- This statement is not accurate. The implied duty of the mother to cooperate is not an excuse for the photographer's failure to cooperate. The implied duty is a condition that must be met for the photographer to be held liable for breach of contract.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is the least accurate with regard to the photographer's taking of the photographs is:\n\nD. The mother's refusal to cooperate reasonably in arranging for the taking of the photographs would excuse the photographer from further obligation under the contract and also give the photographer a right of action against the mother for breach of contract."
