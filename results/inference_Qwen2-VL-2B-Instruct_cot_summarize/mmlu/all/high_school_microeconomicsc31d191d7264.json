A higher wage elasticity of demand indicates that the quantity demanded is more responsive to changes in the price of the good, which means that a small change in the price of the good will result in a larger change in the quantity demanded. This is because the demand for a good is more elastic when the price of the good is higher, and thus a small change in the price will result in a larger change in the quantity demanded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. greater the price elasticity for the product produced by labor."
