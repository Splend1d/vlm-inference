In moral philosophy, there are two main types of moral principles: moral principles that are \"ought\" to be followed (ought implies ought) and moral principles that are \"can\" be followed (can implies can).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"can implies should.\"\n- This option suggests that if something can be done, it should be done. This is a common moral principle that states that actions should be taken based on their ability to be performed rather than their inherent goodness or evil. This aligns with the idea that moral principles should be based on what can be done rather than what is inherently good or bad.\n\nB. \"can implies ought.\"\n- This option suggests that if something can be done, it should be done. This is a common moral principle that states that actions should be taken based on their ability to be performed rather than their inherent goodness or evil. This aligns with the idea that moral principles should be based on what can be done rather than what is inherently good or bad.\n\nC. \"ought implies can.\"\n- This option suggests that if something is ought to be done, it can be done. This is a common moral principle that states that moral principles should be based on what is inherently good or bad rather than what can be done. This aligns with the idea that moral principles should be based on what is inherently good or bad rather than what can be done.\n\nD. \"ought implies should.\"\n- This option suggests that if something is ought to be done, it should be done. This is a common moral principle that states that moral principles should be based on what is inherently good or bad rather than what can be done. This aligns with the idea that moral principles should be based on what is inherently good or bad rather than what can be done.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that aligns with the idea that moral principles should be based on what can be done rather than what is inherently good or bad is:\n\nB. \"can implies ought.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
