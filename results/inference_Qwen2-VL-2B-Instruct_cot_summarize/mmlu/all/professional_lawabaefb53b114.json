                    "text": "A mushroom farmer agreed in a signed writing on January 2 to deliver to a chef at a local restaurant on March 1 a specified quantity of mushrooms at a specified price. The mushrooms on the farmer's farm were usually picked and packaged by the farmer's three sons. On February 27, two of the Sons were injured in a fanning accident and hospitalized. As a result, the farmer encountered a manpower shortage and could not process all of the mushrooms for the chef's order. On February 28, the farmer telephoned the chef and said, \"Because my two sons were injured yesterday, I won't be able to deliver your mushrooms on March 1. However, I am trying to hire some other farm hands to help process your order. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the mushrooms by the end of the week. \" The chef, who knew that the fanner's sons were responsible for the mushroom farming, said, \"No problem. I think I'll be able to get by without them for a few days. However, be advised that I will hold you liable for any loss I sustain as a result of your failure to deliver the mushrooms on March 1 . \" When the chef failed to receive the mushrooms on March 5, he sent the following fax to the fanner:\"I must have the mushrooms no later than March 9. \" This fax was received and read by the farmer on the same day. If the fanner delivers the mushrooms to the chef on March 9 and the chef accepts them, can the chef successfully maintain a contract action against the farmer to recover damages resulting from the delay in delivery?\n\nA. No, because temporary impracticability excused his duty to deliver the mushrooms on March 1.\nB. No, because the buyer's statements and acceptance of the mushrooms constituted a waiver of the condition of timely delivery.\nC. Yes, because his statements to the farmer did not constitute a promise to forgo any cause of action he then had or might later acquire.\nD. Yes, because there was no consideration to support his waiver, if any, of timely delivery.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the chef can successfully maintain a contract action against the farmer to recover damages resulting from the delay in delivery, we need to analyze the situation and the relevant legal principles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Contract**: The chef and the farmer agreed on a specific quantity and price of mushrooms to be delivered on March 1. The farmer's sons were responsible for picking and packaging the mushrooms.\n\n2. **Fanning Accident**: The farmer's two sons were injured in a fanning accident on February 27, which led to a manpower shortage and inability to process all the mushrooms.\n\n3. **Delay in Delivery**: The farmer informed the chef on February 28 that he would not be able to deliver the mushrooms on March 1 due to the manpower shortage. The chef accepted this delay and agreed to hold the farmer liable for any loss.\n\n4. **Chef's Acceptance**: The chef's fax to the farmer on March 5 stated that he would accept the mushrooms no later than March 9.\n\n5. **Contractual Obligation**: The chef's acceptance of the mushrooms on March 5 implies that he accepted the delay in delivery as a condition of the contract. The chef's acceptance is a condition of the contract, and if the delay in delivery is due to a temporary impracticability, the delay would be excused.\n\n6. **Legal Principle**: The delay in delivery due to the fanning accident is considered temporary impracticability, which excused the farmer's duty to deliver the mushrooms on March 1. Therefore, the delay is excused, and the contract is not voided.\n\n**Conclusion**: The chef can successfully maintain a contract action against the farmer to recover damages resulting from the delay in delivery because the delay in delivery due to the fanning accident is considered temporary impracticability, which excused the farmer's duty to deliver the mushrooms on March 1.\n\n**Final Answer**: A. No, because temporary impracticability excused his duty to deliver the mushrooms on March 1."
