Which statement is supported by these observations?\n\nA. Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population.\nB. Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\nC. Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.\nD.

The observations do not suggest that evolution tends toward perfection but rather that the population evolves in response to environmental pressures.\n\nB. **Phenotype is often the result of compromise.**\n   - This statement is supported by the observations. The cross-eyed condition is maladaptive, but the adaptive coat pattern increases in frequency over time, indicating that the phenotype is often the result of compromise between the maladaptive and adaptive traits.\n\nC. **Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.**\n   - This statement is not supported by the observations. The observations do not indicate that natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes but rather that the maladaptive gene is more common initially and then becomes less so over time.\n\nD. **Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.**\n   - This statement is not supported by the observations. The observations do not suggest that polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive but rather that the maladaptive gene is more common initially and then becomes less so over time.\n\nTherefore, the statement supported by the observations is:\n\n**B. Phenotype is often the result of compromise.**"
