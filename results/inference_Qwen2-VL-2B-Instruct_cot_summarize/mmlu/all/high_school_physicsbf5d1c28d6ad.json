This means we want to solve for \u03b8 in the equation:\n\nR = H\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R and H, we get:\n\n(v^2 * sin(2\u03b8)) / g = (v^2 * sin^2(\u03b8)) / g\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin(2\u03b8) = sin^2(\u03b8)\n\nUsing the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) = sin^2(\u03b8)\n\nDividing both sides by sin(\u03b8), we get:\n\n2cos(\u03b8) = sin(\u03b8)\n\nDividing both sides by cos(\u03b8), we get:\n\n2 = tan(\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, the angle \u03b8 is tan\u20131 2, which is approximately 63.4 degrees. However, this is not one of the given options. It seems there may have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided."
