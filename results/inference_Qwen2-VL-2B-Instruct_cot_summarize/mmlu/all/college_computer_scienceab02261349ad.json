The hit ratio is the percentage of accesses that are found in the cache, and the cache policies determine how data are written to and retrieved from the cache.\n\n1. **Write-through**: Every write operation updates main memory. This means that if a write operation is made to a line in the cache, it will be written to main memory. This policy ensures that the cache is always up-to-date with the latest data, but it can lead to higher write latencies if the cache is full.\n\n2. **Write-back**: A write operation to a line found in the cache does not affect main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. This policy ensures that the cache is not full, but it can lead to higher write latencies if the cache is not full.\n\n3. **Write-allocation**: A cache line is allocated and loaded on a write-miss. This policy ensures that the cache is always up-to-date with the latest data, but it can lead to higher write latencies if the cache is full.\n\nGiven the assumption that write-allocation is always used, we need to determine which policy results in a better hit ratio.\n\n- **Write-back**: Every write operation updates main memory. This means that if a write operation is made to a line in the cache, it will be written to main memory. This policy ensures that the cache is always up-to-date with the latest data, but it can lead to higher write latencies if the cache is full.\n- **Write-through**: Every write operation updates main memory. This policy ensures that the cache is always up-to-date with the latest data, but it can lead to higher write latencies if the cache is full.\n\nSince write-allocation is always used, the cache is always up-to-date with the latest data. Therefore, the cache is never full, and the hit ratio is always 100%.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.**\n   - This is incorrect because write-through results in a better hit ratio.\n\nB. **Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.**\n   - This is incorrect because write-through results in a better hit ratio.\n\nC. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.**\n   - This is incorrect because write-back can result in a larger percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation.\n\nD. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for writethrough than for write-back.**\n   - This is correct because write-through results in a better hit ratio.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
