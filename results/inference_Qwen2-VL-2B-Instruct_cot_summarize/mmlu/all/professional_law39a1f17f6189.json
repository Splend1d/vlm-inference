Terribly upset, the woman reached into her pocketbook and said, \"Listen, buddy, I've got a bomb in here, and if you don't give me the money, I'm going to blow up this joint. \" Actually, the woman did not have a bomb in her possession. The owner, who was not deceived by her threat, felt sorry for the woman and agreed to cash the check. The woman, who walked with the assistance of a cane, took the money and limped out of the store.
