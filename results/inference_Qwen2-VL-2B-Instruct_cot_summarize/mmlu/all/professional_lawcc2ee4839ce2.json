A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. The butler also testified that the wealthy man had often confided in him and told him shortly after the woman's birth that the woman was the wealthy man's daughter. Upon objection by the attorney for the executor of the wealthy man's estate, the court will most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection bc butler's testimony would be violative of hearsay rule.\nB. sustain, bc butler's testimony would be violative of Dead man's statute.\nC. overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.\nD. overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\n"

Overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nThe pedigree exception to the hearsay rule allows testimony about a person's relationship to the deceased, even if the relationship is not directly established. In this case, the butler's testimony about the relationship between the wealthy man and the woman's mother is relevant to the ultimate issue in the case, which is the woman's claim that she is the wealthy man's daughter. Therefore, the court is likely to overrule the objection and admit the testimony."
