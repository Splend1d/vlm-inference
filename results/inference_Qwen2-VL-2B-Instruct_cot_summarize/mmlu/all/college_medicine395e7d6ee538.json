Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength.\n- This statement is generally true. Consuming adequate protein is crucial for muscle growth and strength. However, it's important to note that the amount of protein required can vary depending on the individual's body composition and activity level.\n\nB. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n- Creatine is a popular supplement for muscle building and power enhancement. It has been shown to increase muscle mass and strength in many studies.\n\nC. Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n- Amino acids are essential for muscle growth and repair. However, the effectiveness of amino acid supplements for muscle strength and power is less well-documented compared to creatine.\n\nD. Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions.\n- This statement is generally true. Shortening contractions, which are the type of muscle contractions that occur during exercise, can cause muscle damage. However, the severity and duration of muscle damage depend on various factors, including the intensity and duration of the exercise.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is true is:\n\nB. Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power."
