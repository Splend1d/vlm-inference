Its floor shall be a hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\"\nJohn L.

The rail system was developed over time, and its planning was not necessarily planned before the first railway was constructed.\n\n3. **The development of the rails had little effect on the development of American industry.**\n   - This option suggests that the rail system did not significantly impact the development of American industry. However, the passage does not provide enough information to conclude that the rail system had no effect on industry development.\n\n4. **A more highly developed rail system gave the Confederacy a decided advantage in the Civil War.**\n   - This option suggests that the rail system had a significant impact on the Civil War, specifically that a more developed rail system gave the Confederacy an advantage. The passage does not provide enough information to support this claim.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best description of the effect of the American rail system in the nineteenth century is:\n\n**A. Government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient.**"
