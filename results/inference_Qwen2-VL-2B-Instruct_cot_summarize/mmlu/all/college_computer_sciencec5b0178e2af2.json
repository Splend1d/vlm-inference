I and III.\n\nIncreasing the clock cycle rate would improve the execution time of a typical program because it would allow more instructions to be executed per cycle, thus reducing the overall execution time. However, this would not necessarily improve the performance of arithmetic instructions, which have the same CPI.\n\nDisallowing any forwarding in the pipeline would improve the performance of arithmetic instructions by eliminating the overhead of forwarding instructions that are not executed. This would allow more instructions to be executed per cycle, thus reducing the overall execution time.\n\nDoubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time would improve the performance of arithmetic instructions by allowing more instructions to be fetched and executed in parallel. This would also reduce the overall execution time, but it would not necessarily improve the performance of arithmetic instructions."
