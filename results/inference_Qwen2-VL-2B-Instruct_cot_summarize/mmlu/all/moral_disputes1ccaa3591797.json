Arthur's point is that Singer's argument is flawed because it ignores the principles of equality and harm. Singer's argument is based on the idea that individuals should be treated equally and that the harm caused by poverty and hunger should be taken into account when making decisions about how to address these issues. However, Arthur argues that Singer's argument is flawed because it ignores the principle of equality, which states that all individuals should be treated equally, regardless of their economic status or social status. Therefore, the answer is A."
