The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company's objection to the admission of the painter's statements?\n\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\n"

                    "text": "The court will likely sustain the defendant's objection to the admission of the painter's statements. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Statements**: The painter's statements are about the company's employees' failure to reinforce the standing wall, which is a non-painting duty. The painter is not a participant in the negligent act that caused the collapse of the house. His statements are about the company's employees' failure to perform their duties, not about his own negligence or the company's negligence.\n\n2. **Nature of the Evidence**: Statements made by an employee about the company's employees' performance are typically not admissible as evidence of the employee's own negligence. The painter's statements are not about his own negligence but about the negligence of the company's employees.\n\n3. **Scope and Course of Employment**: The painter's statements were made within the scope and course of his employment. He was a co-worker of the negligent employees, and his statements were made in the course of his employment duties.\n\n4. **Subcontractor Status**: The painter may be a subcontractor to the company, but his statements are not about his own negligence but about the negligence of the company's employees.\n\nGiven these points, the court will likely sustain the defendant's objection to the admission of the painter's statements because they are not relevant to the defendant's negligence claim. The statements are about the company's employees' failure to perform their duties, not about the painter's own negligence or the company's negligence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment."
