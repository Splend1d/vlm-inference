This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves feeding the cat a small amount of food, which is not sufficient for the cat's nutritional needs. In Scenario 2, the main character lets their children try to catch frogs. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves allowing children to engage in potentially dangerous activities, such as catching frogs, which can be harmful to the children and the environment."
