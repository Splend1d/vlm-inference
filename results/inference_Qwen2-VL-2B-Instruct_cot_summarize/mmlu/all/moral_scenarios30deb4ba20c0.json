This action is generally considered harmless and not harmful to the children. In Scenario 2, the main character is taking action to save a child who is in danger. This action is morally justified and is considered a necessary action to save the child's life. Therefore, the main character's actions in both scenarios are not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
