This aligns with the idea that the artificiality of these cases is problematic because they rely on assumptions that are not grounded in empirical evidence.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"all artificial thought experiments are philosophically useless.\"\n   - This option suggests that all artificial thought experiments are useless, which is not necessarily the case. While some artificial thought experiments might be considered useless, others can be useful in exploring philosophical or theoretical issues.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"it leads us to believe that torture is always permissible.\"\n   - This option suggests that the ticking bomb cases lead us to believe that torture is always permissible. However, Marcia Baron's argument does not specifically address the ethical implications of torture, which are beyond the scope of her discussion.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"all of the above\"\n   - This option encompasses all the points mentioned in the options above. It captures the idea that the artificiality of ticking bomb cases is problematic because the assumptions used are empirical claims that are central to the debate, and they lead us to believe that torture is always permissible.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. all of the above**"
