Women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice.\n\nDifference feminism is a feminist perspective that emphasizes the unique experiences and perspectives of women, particularly in relation to gender roles and power dynamics. It argues that women's experiences and identities are shaped by social and cultural contexts, whereas men's identities are often constructed through abstract, neutral notions of justice and equality. This perspective highlights the importance of understanding and acknowledging the specific challenges and struggles faced by women in order to achieve true equality."
