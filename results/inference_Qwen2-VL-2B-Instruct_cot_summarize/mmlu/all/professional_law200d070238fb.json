The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue \"cease and desist\" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who \"intentionally engaged in price gouging. \" In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment.

The agency is authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law and to issue \"cease and desist\" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who \"intentionally engaged in price gouging.\"\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. **Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.**\n   - This option suggests that the agency cannot interpret existing federal laws. However, the agency is authorized to interpret existing federal laws, which implies that it has the power to do so.\n\nB. **Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.**\n   - This option suggests that the agency cannot issue \"cease and desist\" orders, which are punishable by imprisonment. However, the agency is authorized to issue \"cease and desist\" orders, which are punishable by fine and/or imprisonment.\n\nC. **Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.**\n   - This option suggests that the agency cannot enforce federal laws in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts. However, the agency is authorized to enforce federal laws, which implies that it can enforce them.\n\nD. **Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.**\n   - This option suggests that Congress cannot retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of the agency. However, the agency is authorized to have four members appointed by the President and two by the Senate, which implies that it can have a majority of members.\n\nGiven the context and the powers granted to the agency, the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency is:\n\n**B. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the power of the agency to issue \"cease and desist\" orders, which are punishable by imprisonment, and suggests that this power is not within the agency's authority."
