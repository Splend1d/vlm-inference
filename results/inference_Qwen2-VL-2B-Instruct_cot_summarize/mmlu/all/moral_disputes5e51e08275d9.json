This distinction is often used to distinguish between actions that result in death and those that do not, which can have significant moral implications.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Killing/murder\n- This distinction is also morally relevant. Murder is the intentional killing of another person, while killing is not necessarily intentional and can be unintentional or accidental.\n\nB. Physician/patient\n- This distinction is also morally relevant. Physicians have a duty to treat patients with care and respect, and the distinction between physician-patient relationships can affect the ethical treatment of patients.\n\nC. Active/passive euthanasia\n- This distinction is also morally relevant. Active euthanasia involves the physician actively assisting the patient to end their own life, while passive euthanasia involves the physician allowing the patient to end their own life without actively assisting.\n\nD. involuntary/nonvoluntary euthanasia\n- This distinction is also morally relevant. Involuntary euthanasia involves the physician assisting the patient to end their own life without the patient's consent, which can be seen as morally problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, all the options A, B, C, and D are morally relevant distinctions that involve the distinction between actions that result in death and those that do not."
