                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. not recover, because under the circumstances the manufacturer substantially performed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Material Breach**: The contract specifies that the widgets must be shipped C.O.D., meaning they must be delivered to the buyer's premises. The manufacturer delivered 490 widgets, which were accepted and paid for by the buyer. This delivery was not in breach of the contract because it was not in violation of the contract terms.\n\n2. **Substantial Performance**: The manufacturer's performance was substantial because they delivered the agreed-upon quantity of widgets, which was 500. This is a significant performance that meets the definition of substantial performance under the law.\n\n3. **Material Breach**: The material breach occurs when the performance is not up to the standard required by the contract. In this case, the manufacturer delivered 490 widgets, which was less than the agreed-upon quantity of 500. This is a material breach because it falls short of the contract's requirements.\n\nGiven that the manufacturer delivered the agreed-upon quantity of widgets and the contract specifies that the delivery must be C.O.D., the manufacturer's performance was substantial. Therefore, the buyer cannot recover because the material breach was not committed by the manufacturer.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A. not recover, because under the circumstances the manufacturer substantially performed."
