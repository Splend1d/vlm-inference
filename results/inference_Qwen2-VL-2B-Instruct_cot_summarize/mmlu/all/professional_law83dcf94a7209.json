Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n"

                    "text": "The problem involves understanding the legal implications of encroachment on state-owned property and the rights of the state to control and manage its coastal lands. Here's a detailed analysis of each option:\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\n- This statement is incorrect. Abandonment of real property by a governmental entity typically requires an official vote, such as a public hearing or a formal notice to the public. The State Coastal Commission is a governmental entity, and it would need to follow the proper procedures to abandon the walkway.\n\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\n- This statement is incorrect. The State Coastal Commission owns the walkway, and the man's encroachment was done without notifying the state. The state has the right to reclaim the land if it is not used properly, but it does not create an irrevocable license.\n\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n- This statement is incorrect. Adverse possession is a legal process by which a person can acquire title to land by continuous and uninterrupted use for a period of time. The man did not use the walkway for the required period of adverse possession, so he cannot claim title to it.\n\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n- This statement is incorrect. The State Coastal Commission owns the walkway, and the man's encroachment was done without notifying the state. The state has the right to reclaim the land if it is not used properly, but it does not own the land itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession."
