                    "text": "To find the first term of the sequence that exceeds 5000, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. The sequence is defined as follows: each term is the sum of all the previous terms. This means that the first term is 1, and the second term is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), the third term is \\(2 + 2 = 4\\), and so on.\n\nLet's denote the first term as \\(a_1 = 1\\). The second term is \\(a_2 = a_1 + a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\nThe third term is \\(a_3 = a_2 + a_2 = 2 + 2 = 4\\).\n\nWe can see that the sequence is growing by a factor of 2 each time. To find the first term that exceeds 5000, we need to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n > 5000\\).\n\nWe can use the formula for the \\(n\\)th term of the sequence, which is \\(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference. In this case, \\(d = 2\\), so we have:\n\n\\[a_n = 1 + (n - 1) \\cdot 2\\]\n\nWe want to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n > 5000\\):\n\n\\[1 + (n - 1) \\cdot 2 > 5000\\]\n\n\\[n - 1 > \\frac{5000 - 1}{2}\\]\n\n\\[n - 1 > 2499\\]\n\n\\[n > 2500\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 2500 is 2501. Therefore, the first term that exceeds 5000 is \\(a_{2501} = 1 + (2501 - 1) \\cdot 2 = 1 + 2500 \\cdot 2 = 1 + 5000 = 5001\\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. 5001."
