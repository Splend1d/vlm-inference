Placing celery stalks in water colored with a dye and observing the results\n\nThis activity will be most effective in introducing kindergartners to the concept of how plants transport water because it involves the use of a simple, hands-on experiment that can be easily understood by young children. By placing celery stalks in water and observing the results, children can see the difference in the color of the water when the stalks are peeled lengthwise and crosswise. This can help them understand that the stalks are transporting water from the roots to the leaves."
