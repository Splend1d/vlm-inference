It fails to specify the source of authority.\n\nThe rule of recognition is a principle that allows judges to decide cases based on the legal text of the constitution, rather than on the principles of the common law or the precedents set by the court. This means that the judges are not making decisions based on their own interpretation of the law, but rather on the text of the constitution itself. This lack of specificity about the source of authority makes it difficult for judges to justify their decisions, as they are not relying on any established principles or precedents to support their rulings."
