The state adopted the so-called \"disaffiliation\" statute in order to have intraparty feuds resolved in primary elections rather than in the general election. Moreover, the state's elections director strongly supported the law and argued that it was necessary to avoid voter confusion and to ensure that the general election winner received a majority. A man, who was a registered Democrat in 2008, now wishes to run as an independent candidate in the November, 2009, general election. However, the elections director ruled that his candidacy violated the state's \"disaffiliation\" statute and barred him from appearing on the ballot. If the man files suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nC. The man must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nD. The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n"

This means that the statute must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and must not be more restrictive than necessary to achieve that interest.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.\n- This option is incorrect because the state's election statute is not about equal protection but about preventing independent candidates from running in the general election.\n\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\n- This option is correct because the state's election statute is designed to prevent independent candidates from running in the general election, which is a fundamental right of the individual.\n\nC. The man must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\n- This option is incorrect because the state's election statute is designed to prevent independent candidates from running in the general election, which is a fundamental right of the individual.\n\nD.
