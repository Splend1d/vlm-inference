One day that employee came uninvited into the owner's office brandishing a loaded shotgun, approached the owner's desk and raised the weapon. The owner, however, was secretly waiting for the opportunity. As the employee began to press on the trigger, the owner pulled a gun from her drawer and killed him. The owner admitted she felt malice toward her enemy. The authorities charged her with murder. Can she be convicted?\n\nA. No, because she acted in self-defense.\nB. No, because these facts constitute justifiable homicide.\nC. Yes, because she had been lying in wait for the victim.\nD. Yes, because the owner cannot claim self-defense when her motive is evil.\n"

Yes, because the owner cannot claim self-defense when her motive is evil.\n\nThe key to determining whether the owner can be convicted of murder lies in the definition of self-defense. Self-defense requires that the defendant acted in a manner that was necessary to protect themselves or others from imminent harm. In this case, the owner's motive was malice, which is not a justifiable defense under the law. Therefore, the owner cannot be convicted of murder."
