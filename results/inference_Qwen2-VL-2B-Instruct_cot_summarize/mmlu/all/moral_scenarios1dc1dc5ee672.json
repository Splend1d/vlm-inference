Letting children play in a shallow creek is generally considered safe and appropriate for children. However, if the shallow creek is contaminated with harmful substances, it could pose a risk to the children's health. In scenario 2, the main character is using an illegal substance on the ball, which is clearly morally wrong. This action could lead to the ball being unplayable and could potentially harm the player or others who handle the ball."
