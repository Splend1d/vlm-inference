(ii) and (iv) only.\n\nThe standard error of the slope coefficient is calculated as the standard deviation of the residuals divided by the standard error of the slope coefficient. The standard error of the slope coefficient is inversely related to the residual variance, which is the variance of the residuals. Therefore, statement (i) is true. The standard error is also inversely related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value, which is the variance of the residuals. Therefore, statement (ii) is also true. The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate, which is a property of the standard error itself, not of the slope coefficient. Therefore, statement (iv) is also true. However, statement (iii) is not true because the standard error is not directly related to the sample size."
