Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by electron capture detection\n\nThis method is best suited for measuring trace amounts (sub-ppb) of CFCs in an air sample because it allows for the separation of the CFCs from other compounds in the sample, which can then be detected using an electron capture detector. This method is sensitive enough to detect CFCs at very low concentrations in the air sample."
