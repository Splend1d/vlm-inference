Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living.\n- This statement acknowledges that doctors are qualified to make decisions about life and death, but it does not address the specific issue of whether the law falsely assumes doctors are qualified to judge the worth of a life.\n\nB. Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.\n- This statement acknowledges that doctors are required to make life-and-death decisions, but it does not address the specific issue of whether the law falsely assumes doctors are qualified to judge the worth of a life.\n\nC. The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.\n- This statement suggests that the argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors, but it does not directly address the specific issue of whether the law falsely assumes doctors are qualified to judge the worth of a life.\n\nD. The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.\n- This statement directly addresses the specific issue by stating that the law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis, which is a different aspect of the argument.\n\nGiven the context, the statement that best describes Gill's response is:\n\nD. The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.\n\nFinal answer: D."
