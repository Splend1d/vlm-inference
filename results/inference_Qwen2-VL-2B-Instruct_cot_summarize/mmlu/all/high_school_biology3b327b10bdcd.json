Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n"

The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\n\nDuring cellular respiration, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle) is the first stage where pyruvate is broken down into acetyl-CoA. This process releases a small amount of energy, but it is not the primary source of energy. The Krebs cycle is crucial for the production of NADH and FADH, which are then used in the electron transport chain to generate ATP.\n\nThe electron transport chain is the second stage of cellular respiration, where NADH and FADH are used to reduce oxygen to water. This process releases a significant amount of energy, which is used to phosphorylate ADP into ATP. The ATP produced in this process is the most energy-rich form of ATP, and it is the primary source of energy for the cell.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that the Krebs cycle releases a small amount of energy, but the electron transport chain releases a significant amount of energy, which is used to phosphorylate ADP into ATP."
