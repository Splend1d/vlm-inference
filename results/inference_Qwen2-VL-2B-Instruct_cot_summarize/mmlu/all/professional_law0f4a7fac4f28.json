The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway.

The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. This assignment is not explicitly stated as a bar against assignment, but it is a violation of the contract's prohibition.\n\nThe key point here is that the assignment of the right to receive the funds is not explicitly stated as a bar against assignment. Instead, it is a violation of the contract's prohibition. Therefore, the court would not enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated."
