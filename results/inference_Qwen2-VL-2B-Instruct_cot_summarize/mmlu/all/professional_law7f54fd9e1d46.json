The chief purpose of the code is to limit traffic congestion and noise in the neighborhood. One provision in the code provides that a \"family\" means a number of individuals related to the nominal head of the household or to the latter's spouse living as a single housekeeping unit in a single dwelling unit, but is limited to the following:(a) husband or wife of the nominal head of the household;(b) married or unmarried children of the nominal head of the household or the latter's spouse, provided, however, that such married or unmarried children have no children of their own residing with them;(c) father or mother of the nominal head of the household or of the latter's spouse. A resident of the city lives in her home together with her son and his two children. She received a notice of violation from the city which stated that both grandchildren were illegal occupants of her home and that she must comply with the code. After she fails to remove her two grandchildren, the city brings criminal charges against the resident. In an action by the resident challenging the constitutionality of the code provision, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. constitutional, on the grounds that the housing provision bears a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.\nB. constitutional, under the state police power.\nC. unconstitutional, as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.\n"

The provision in question is aimed at preventing illegal occupants from living in the home, which is a direct violation of the code's intent.\n\n2. **Nature of the Violation**: The resident's son and his two children are living together in the home, which is a violation of the code's provision that limits occupancy to a single family. This is a clear violation of the code's purpose.\n\n3. **Due Process Clause**: The Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees due process of law. The resident's right to live in her home with her son and his children is a fundamental right protected by the due process clause. The city's action of bringing criminal charges against her for this violation is a violation of her due process rights.\n\n4. **State Police Power**: The state police power is a constitutional principle that allows the state to regulate certain activities to protect public safety and order. The city's action of bringing criminal charges is a legitimate exercise of the state's police power.\n\nTherefore, the court will most likely declare the provision unconstitutional, as it is a violation of the resident's due process rights and a violation of the state's police power."
