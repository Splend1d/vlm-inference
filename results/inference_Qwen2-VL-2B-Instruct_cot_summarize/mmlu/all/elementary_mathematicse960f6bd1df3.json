The least common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10, so we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{10} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{10} \\]\n\nNow we can add the fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{9}{10} \\]\n\nSo, the fraction of cans of soup that are either tomato or chicken noodle is 9/10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 10-Jul"
