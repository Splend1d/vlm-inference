The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring the corporation to produce all emails and internal documents regarding the corporation's knowledge of the risks of an oil spill. The corporation has objected, citing its Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Can the subpoena be enforced?\n\nA. No, because the corporation was not granted transactional immunity.\nB. No, because the corporation was not granted use-and-derivative-use immunity.\nC. Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.\nD. Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n"

Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies only to individuals, not corporations. In this case, the corporation is a legal entity, and it does not have the same constitutional protections as an individual. Therefore, the corporation cannot invoke the privilege against self-incrimination to prevent the production of documents related to its knowledge of the risks of an oil spill.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because the corporation was not granted transactional immunity.\n   - Transactional immunity refers to the protection of a corporation from criminal prosecution for acts committed by its employees. The corporation is not immune from criminal prosecution, so it cannot invoke transactional immunity to avoid production of documents.\n\nB. No, because the corporation was not granted use-and-derivative-use immunity.\n   - Use-and-derivative-use immunity refers to the protection of a corporation from criminal prosecution for acts committed by its agents. The corporation is not immune from criminal prosecution, so it cannot invoke use-and-derivative-use immunity to avoid production of documents.\n\nC. Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.\n   - This statement is incorrect. Corporations, like individuals, have the right to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
