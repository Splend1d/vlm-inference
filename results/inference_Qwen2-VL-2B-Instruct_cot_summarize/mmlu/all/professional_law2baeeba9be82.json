A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: \"Take one tablet twice a day. \"The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?\n\nA. It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.\nB. He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.\nC. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\nD. The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.\n"

He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\n\nThe reason is that the pharmacist was in a rush and misread the prescription, leading to the incorrect medication being dispensed. This is a common scenario where reasonable care would have been exercised, but the pharmacist's mistake was the result of a rushed situation. The pharmacist's actions were not deliberate, and the pharmacist was not in a position to foresee the consequences of his actions. Therefore, the pharmacist's actions can be considered reasonable under the circumstances."
