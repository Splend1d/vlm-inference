This means that Congress has the authority to impose taxes on individuals and businesses, including taxes on the sale of firearms.\n\nIn the case of the handgun tax, Congress has enacted a law that imposes a tax on the sale of any handgun to a private individual not for use in law enforcement or military duties. This tax is intended to generate revenue for the federal government. Therefore, the new handgun tax will likely survive a constitutional challenge if Congress could have banned possession of handguns outright, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue, if the tax does not result in a significant collection of revenue, or if the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, if Congress could have banned possession of handguns outright."
