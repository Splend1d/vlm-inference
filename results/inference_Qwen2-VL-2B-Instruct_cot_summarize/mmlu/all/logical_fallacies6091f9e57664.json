In Christian theology, God is often depicted as the creator of the universe, including time, and the creation of time is seen as a necessary consequence of God's creation. Maimonides' statement, on the other hand, suggests that time was created independently of God's will and volition, which contradicts the Christian view of God's role in the creation of the universe."
