For the same \u03b1, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases.\n\nThe \u03c72 distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used to test hypotheses about the variance of a normal distribution. The \u03c72 distribution is defined for nonnegative values of the variable, and it is symmetric about the mean. The area under the \u03c72 curve is 1, meaning that the probability of observing a \u03c72 statistic greater than or equal to a given value is 1. The \u03c72 distribution is not defined for negative values of the variable, and it is not skewed."
