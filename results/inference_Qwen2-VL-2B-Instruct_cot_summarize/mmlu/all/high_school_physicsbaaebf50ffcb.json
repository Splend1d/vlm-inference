                    "text": "To determine the new orbit of the satellite after the meteor collision, we need to consider the principles of orbital mechanics and the conservation of energy.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The satellite is initially in a circular orbit with a constant speed. The speed of the satellite is increased by 1% due to the meteor collision, but the direction of the velocity remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy of the satellite remains constant. The initial energy is the sum of its kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. After the collision, the kinetic energy increases by 1%, but the gravitational potential energy remains constant.\n\n3. **New Kinetic Energy**: The kinetic energy of the satellite increases by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1\\% \\times \\text{mass} \\times \\text{speed}^2 \\). Since the speed increases by 1%, the new kinetic energy is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1\\% \\times \\text{mass} \\times \\text{speed}^2 \\times 1.01 \\).\n\n4. **New Gravitational Potential Energy**: The gravitational potential energy remains constant. The increase in kinetic energy is balanced by the decrease in gravitational potential energy.\n\n5. **New Orbital Radius**: The increase in kinetic energy is equal to the decrease in gravitational potential energy. Therefore, the new orbital radius is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1\\% \\times \\text{mass} \\times \\text{speed}^2 \\times 1.01 \\).\n\n6. **New Orbital Speed**: The new orbital speed is \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1\\% \\times \\text{mass} \\times \\text{speed}^2 \\times 1.01}{\\text{mass} \\times \\text{speed}^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1\\% \\times 1.01}{1}} = \\sqrt{2.02} \\approx 1.41 \\).\n\n7. **New Orbital Path**: The new orbital path is an ellipse with the center at the point of collision (P) and the semi-major axis being the new orbital radius. The semi-major axis is approximately \\( \\sqrt{2.02} \\approx 1.41 \\).\n\nTherefore, the satellite's new orbit is an ellipse with P as the closest approach to Earth, and the semi-major axis is approximately 1.41 times the original radius of the satellite's orbit.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth."
