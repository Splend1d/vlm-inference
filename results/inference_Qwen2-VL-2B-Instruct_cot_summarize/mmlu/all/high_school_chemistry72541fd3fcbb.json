The entropy of the system increases due to the separation of the electron from its atom.\nC.

It is an exothermic process due to the release of energy as an electron is liberated from the Coulombic attraction holding it to the nucleus.\n\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy is a technique used to study the electronic structure of atoms and molecules by measuring the energy of the electrons that are ejected from the atom when it absorbs light. The ionization of atoms during photoelectron spectroscopy is possible because the energy of the light absorbed by the atom is sufficient to overcome the Coulombic attraction between the electron and the nucleus, resulting in the liberation of an electron. This process is exothermic, meaning it releases energy, which is why it can occur even though ionization is not a thermodynamically favored process."
