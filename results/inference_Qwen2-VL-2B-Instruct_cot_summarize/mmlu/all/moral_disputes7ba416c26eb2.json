It ignores the possibility that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.\n\nThe argument Corvino is addressing is flawed because it assumes that because homosexuality is innate, it must be inherently good and natural. This is a form of the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone assumes that because a conclusion logically follows from a premise, the conclusion itself must be true. In this case, Corvino is assuming that because homosexuality is innate, it must be good and natural, which is not necessarily true."
