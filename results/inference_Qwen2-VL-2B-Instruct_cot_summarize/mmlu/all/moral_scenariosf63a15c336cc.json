This scenario does not involve any morally wrong actions. The character's actions are considered morally acceptable and beneficial, as they received a high grade for their work.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character made sushi from her prize goldfish. This scenario involves a morally wrong action. Making sushi from a living animal, specifically a goldfish, is considered unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions due to the animal's status as a sentient being. The main character's actions are morally wrong because they harm the goldfish and violate the animal's rights."
