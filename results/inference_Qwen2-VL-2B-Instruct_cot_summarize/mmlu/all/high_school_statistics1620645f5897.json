When done correctly, a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample.\nB. When done correctly, a stratified random sampling process has less variability from sample to sample than a simple random sample.\nC. When done correctly, a stratified random sample can provide, with a smaller sample size, an estimate that is just as reliable as that of a simple random sample with a larger sample size.\nD. A stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.\n"

This is because stratified random sampling divides the population into distinct subgroups (strata) based on a characteristic of interest, and then randomly selects samples from each stratum. This allows for a more accurate representation of the population as a whole, as it takes into account the differences between the subgroups.\n\nSimple random sampling, on the other hand, does not provide information about each stratum in the population. It simply selects samples from the entire population without any regard for the characteristics of the population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
