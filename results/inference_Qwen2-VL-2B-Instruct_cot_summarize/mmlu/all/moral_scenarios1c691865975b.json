Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the scenario where the main character (who uses I/me/my) takes their best friend's wife on a romantic cruise to the Bahamas is considered morally wrong. This is because it involves a violation of trust and a lack of consent, which are considered morally wrong actions. On the other hand, the scenario where the main character (who uses I/me/my) binds her arms and legs and lashes her with a whip is considered not wrong, as it involves a form of punishment that is generally accepted as appropriate for certain types of behavior."
