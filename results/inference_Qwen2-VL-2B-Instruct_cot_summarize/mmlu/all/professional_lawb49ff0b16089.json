In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?\n\nA. Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nB. Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nC. Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\nD. Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the distribution of assets in this scenario, we need to consider the legal implications of the prenuptial agreement and the distribution of assets under Florida law.\n\n1. **Prenuptial Agreement**: Kathy executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. This means that under Florida law, the prenuptial agreement is binding and will govern the distribution of assets if the marriage is dissolved.\n\n2. **Distribution under Florida Law**: In Florida, the distribution of assets is governed by the laws of intestacy and the will of the deceased. If the deceased leaves no will, the distribution is governed by the laws of intestacy.\n\n3. **Distribution under Intestacy**: If the deceased leaves no will, the distribution is governed by the laws of intestacy. In Florida, intestacy is governed by the laws of succession, which prioritize the distribution of assets to the surviving lineal descendants of the deceased.\n\n4. **Surviving Lineal Descendants**: In this case, Bill leaves no will, and his surviving lineal descendants are his son Tommy and his daughter Julie. Since Bill leaves no will, the distribution will be governed by the laws of intestacy.\n\n5. **Distribution under Intestacy**: In Florida, intestacy is governed by the laws of succession. The distribution of assets under intestacy is as follows:\n   - The estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal descendants.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal descendants, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren, the estate is divided equally among the surviving lineal great-great-great-grandchildren.\n   - If there are no surviving lineal great-great-g"
