At trial, the plaintiff was asked questions on direct examination about the days on which she had observed large amounts of dust in the air and how long the condition had lasted. She testified that she could not remember the specific times, but that she maintained a diary in which she had accurately recorded this information on a daily basis. When her attorney sought to refresh her recollection with her diary, she still could not remember. The plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the information in the diary admitted at trial. Is the information admissible?\n\nA. No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.\nB. No, unless it is offered by the defendant.\nC. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\nD. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.\n"

                    "text": "The plaintiff's attorney's request to have the diary admitted at trial hinges on the admissibility of the information contained within it. The key issue here is whether the diary can be used to refresh the plaintiff's recollection and, if so, whether the information in the diary can be admitted at trial.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.**\n   - This option suggests that the diary did not provide any new information that could refresh the plaintiff's memory. However, the diary does provide specific information about the days on which she observed dust in the air, which could potentially be relevant to the case.\n\nB. **No, unless it is offered by the defendant.**\n   - This option implies that the diary cannot be used unless it is presented by the defendant. However, the diary is not being presented by the defendant; rather, the plaintiff's attorney is seeking to use it to refresh the plaintiff's recollection.\n\nC. **Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.**\n   - This option suggests that the diary can be used to refresh the plaintiff's recollection and that the diary can be admitted at trial. However, it does not address the admissibility of the diary itself.\n\nD. **Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.**\n   - This option aligns with the idea that the diary can be used to refresh the plaintiff's recollection and that the diary can be admitted at trial. It also suggests that the diary can be read into evidence, which is not explicitly stated in the options provided.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate and comprehensive answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that the diary can be used to refresh the plaintiff's recollection and that the diary can be admitted at trial."
