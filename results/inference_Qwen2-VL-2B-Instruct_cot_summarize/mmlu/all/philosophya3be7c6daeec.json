Let's break down each option to determine which one best explains why an unexamined life is not worth living according to Socrates.\n\nA. Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.\n- This option suggests that being virtuous is more about being accepted by others rather than being virtuous oneself. Socrates would argue against this, as he believed that being virtuous is about self-awareness and self-improvement, not just being accepted by others.\n\nB. Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.\n- This option implies that Socrates' philosophy is the only way to be virtuous. However, Socrates' philosophy is not the only way to be virtuous; there are other ways to live virtuously, such as through self-awareness and self-improvement.\n\nC. Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.\n- This option suggests that an unexamined life is not worth living because one does not know the reasons behind their actions. Socrates would argue that this is a fundamental flaw in the idea of an unexamined life, as it implies that one's actions are not guided by reason or purpose.\n\nD. Because a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own.\n- This option suggests that a virtuous life is about conforming to societal norms, which Socrates would argue is not virtuous. Socrates believed that true virtuous behavior is about self-awareness and self-improvement, not just following societal norms.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option C best explains why an unexamined life is not worth living according to Socrates. The argument hinges on the lack of self-awareness and the inability to determine the justification and purpose behind one's actions without examining them.\n\nFinal answer: C. Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated."
