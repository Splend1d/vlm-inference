Section 22 of the city's reform act of 2010, which is to become effective on January 1, 2010, provides: \"Any parent or guardian financially responsible for the education of his ward may claim a direct tax credit against his income tax liability equal to the amount of tuition of a child or children of high school age who does not attend a public high school. \" Other provisions define \"tuition\" very broadly but limit the credit to tuition paid to schools meeting the educational requirements as determined by the state. On December 1, 2009, the parents of two students who attend a public high school in the state sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court, claiming that Section 22 violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment.

                    "text": "The issue at hand involves a legal challenge to a state's tax law, specifically Section 22 of the city's reform act of 2010, which provides a tax credit for tuition paid to schools meeting certain educational requirements. The plaintiffs are parents of two students attending a public high school in the state, who are seeking a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court to challenge the constitutionality of the tax credit.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Dismiss the action, because the suit involves a political question.**\n   - This option suggests that the issue is too complex or too abstract to be decided by the court. However, the issue is not about the constitutionality of the tax credit itself but rather about whether it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. This is a legal question, not a political one.\n\nB. **Dismiss the action, because the plaintiffs lack standing as taxpayers.**\n   - This option suggests that the plaintiffs do not have the legal standing to bring the lawsuit. However, the plaintiffs are parents of students who are attending public high schools, which means they are taxpayers in the state. Therefore, they have standing to bring the lawsuit.\n\nC. **Dismiss the action, because the issues are not ripe.**\n   - This option suggests that the issues are not yet ripe for litigation. However, the issue is about the constitutionality of the tax credit, which is a legal question that can be decided by the court. The issue is not about the state's ability to impose the tax credit or the state's ability to enforce it.\n\nD. **Dismiss the action, because the issues being litigated are moot.**\n   - This option suggests that the issues are no longer relevant because the tax credit has already been implemented. However, the issue is about the constitutionality of the tax credit, which is a legal question that can be decided by the court.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the issue, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. dismiss the action, because the plaintiffs lack standing as taxpayers.**\n\nThis option aligns with the fact that the plaintiffs are parents of students who are attending public high schools, which means they are taxpayers in the state."
