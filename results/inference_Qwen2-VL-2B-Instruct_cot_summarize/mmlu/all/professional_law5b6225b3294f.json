She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as \"pregnancy complications.\" The proposed witness had been a vice-president of the company and a close adviser to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules. Will the court likely grant the appeal, and order a new trial?\n\nA. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\nB. No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible.\nC. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\nD. Yes, because it was admissible under the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception to the hearsay rules.\n"

The key issue here is whether the testimony of the former co-worker, who was a vice-president and a close adviser to the president, was admissible under the federal rules of evidence.\n\nThe court will likely find that the testimony was not admissible under the hearsay rule because it was not a spontaneous utterance. The hearsay rule generally allows testimony about statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding, but it does not apply to statements made in a non-judicial setting, such as a private conversation or informal meeting.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to conclude that the testimony should have been excluded as hearsay, and that the jury's verdict should be reversed. This is because the testimony was not a spontaneous utterance and was not admissible under the hearsay rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible."
