This is considered a violation of food safety and hygiene standards, which are generally considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) brought his dog to the pound as a solution, which is generally considered morally wrong as well. However, in this case, it is not explicitly stated that the dog is causing harm or distress to others, so it may be considered morally less wrong than serving undercooked chicken."
