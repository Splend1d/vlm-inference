According to their agreement, the owner was to pay the money to the landscaper's son. The landscaper intended to have the $5,000 given to his son as a graduation present. After the landscaper completed the job, the landscaper requested that the owner pay the $5,000 to him instead of to his son. The owner paid the landscaper. The next day, the son learned of the contract between the landscaper and the owner, as well as the payment to his father. In an action by the son against the owner for $5,000, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the written contract between the owner and the landscaper operated as a valid assignment to the son.\nB. prevail, because the son was the intended beneficiary under the terms of the written contract between the owner and the landscaper.\nC. not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.\nD. not prevail, because the son did not give any consideration.\n"

Not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Original Agreement**: The landscaper agreed to landscape the owner's house for $5,000, and the owner agreed to pay the money to the landscaper's son.\n\n2. **Modification**: The landscaper requested that the owner pay the $5,000 to him instead of to his son. This modification of the original agreement is a clear breach of the terms of the contract.\n\n3. **Effect on Beneficiary**: The son was the intended beneficiary under the terms of the original contract. However, the modification by the landscaper effectively deprived the son of any rights he had under the contract.\n\n4. **Principle of Assignment**: In a contract, an assignment of rights is considered valid if it is in writing and the assignee has the right to enforce the contract. In this case, the modification by the landscaper was not in writing, and the son did not have the right to enforce the contract.\n\nTherefore, the son will most likely not prevail in the action against the owner for $5,000, as the modification of the contract by the landscaper effectively deprived the son of any rights he had under the original agreement."
