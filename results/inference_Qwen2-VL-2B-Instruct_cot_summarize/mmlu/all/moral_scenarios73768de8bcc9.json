According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, cutting children is generally considered morally wrong because it involves harm to the children's physical or emotional well-being. In Scenario 2, the main character took pictures of her while she was at the baby shower. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves taking private photos without the consent of the person being photographed, which can be considered invasion of privacy."
