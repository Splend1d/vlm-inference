Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security.\nB. The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.\nC. The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system.\nD. Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.\n"

The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.\n\nPrior to the late 20th century, the neglect of the role of women in war was due to the focus on the state's security and the perceived lack of direct impact on the state's stability and security. Women's roles in violence were often seen as secondary to the state's interests, and their contributions were not considered as individuals or as women. This perspective was prevalent in security studies and contributed to the neglect of the role of women in war."
