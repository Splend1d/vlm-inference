This action is morally wrong because it is a clear violation of the hotel's cleaning service contract and the hotel's policy on maintaining a clean environment. In Scenario 2, the main character encouraged the politician to sleep on their proposal. This action is not morally wrong because it is a political strategy to gain support or influence, which is a common practice in politics."
