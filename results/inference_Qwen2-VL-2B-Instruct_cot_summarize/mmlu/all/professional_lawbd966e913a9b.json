In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?\n\nA. Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.\nB. No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.\nC. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\nD. Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the couple can prevail on a theory of adverse possession, we need to analyze the relevant legal principles and the specific circumstances of the case.\n\n1. **Statutory Period**: The required statutory period for adverse possession in the state is 20 years. This means that if the couple had been continuously occupying the land for 20 years, they would have had the right to claim adverse possession.\n\n2. **Continuous Occupancy**: The couple had been occupying the land continuously for 20 years. This means they had been on the land for the entirety of the statutory period.\n\n3. **Tax Payments**: The couple had missed some tax payments during the 20-year period. However, the statutory period for adverse possession is based on continuous occupancy, not on the amount of tax payments. The couple's failure to pay taxes does not affect the duration of their occupancy.\n\n4. **Ejectment Action**: The couple had stopped paying rent two years after consulting an attorney. This interruption of their occupancy does not affect the duration of their occupancy.\n\n5. **Attorney Consultation**: Consulting an attorney is not a requirement for adverse possession. The couple's decision to consult an attorney does not affect the duration of their occupancy.\n\nGiven these points, the couple has been continuously occupying the land for 20 years, which is sufficient for adverse possession. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.**"
