When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.\n\u2014Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500\u20131000 BCE\nWhich of the following would best contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which option best contradicts the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE, we need to analyze each option in the context of the provided information.\n\nThe argument suggests that the Rig Veda, which is the oldest surviving literary work, outlines the first rites and the creation of the world based on the sacrifice of Purusa, who is the lord of the immortals. The sacrifice is divided into four parts: Purusa's mouth, arms, thighs, and feet. The Brahman (mouth) is considered the ultimate source of all things, the Rajanaya (arms) is the ruler of the world, the Vaisya (thighs) is the provider, and the Sudra (feet) is the lowest social class.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle.\n- This option suggests that the Kshatriya class is superior to others, implying that they have a higher status and are more important than others. This aligns with the idea that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles.\n\nB. The four divisions of human society are created by me [Krishna].\n- This option suggests that the creation of the four divisions of human society is attributed to a deity, Krishna. This implies that the caste system was not imposed by the gods but rather by a deity, which contradicts the idea that the caste system was rigid.\n\nC. The person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabarata was born to a fisherwoman.\n- This option suggests that the composition of the Mahabarata, a significant work in Indian literature, was not attributed to a deity but rather to a person born to a fisherwoman. This implies that the composition of the work was not rigidly imposed by the gods but rather by a human.\n\nD. The Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer.\n- This option suggests that Shiva, a significant deity in Hinduism, has multiple roles, which implies that the creation of the world and the division of Purusa into four parts were not rigidly imposed by the gods but rather by Shiva, who has multiple aspects.\n\nAmong these options, option B best contradicts the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE, as it suggests that the creation of the four divisions of human society was attributed to a deity, Krishna, rather than the gods.\n\nFinal answer: B. The four divisions of human society are created by me [Krishna]."
