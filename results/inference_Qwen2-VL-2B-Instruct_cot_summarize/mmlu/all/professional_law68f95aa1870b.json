As the hiker came around a bend in the trail, he suddenly saw a hunter standing next to the trail, looking in the other direction. The hunter was holding a rifle. The hunter turned, causing the rifle to be pointed at the hiker. The hiker felt sure that he was going to get shot, but the gun did not go off. The hiker asserts a claim for assault against the hunter. In his action, the most likely result is that the hiker will\n\nA. recover, because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at him.\nB. recover, because the hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary.\nC. not recover, unless the hunter intended to scare the hiker.\nD. not recover, if the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\n"
