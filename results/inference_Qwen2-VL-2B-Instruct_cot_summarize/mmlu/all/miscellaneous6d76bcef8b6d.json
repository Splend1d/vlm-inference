Therefore, the number of molecules in 36.0 grams of water is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of molecules} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of water}}{\\text{Molar mass of water}} = \\frac{36.0 \\text{ grams}}{18.015 \\text{ grams/mol}} \\approx 1.92 \\text{ molecules} \\]\n\nSince oxygen (O_2) contains 2 molecules per molecule of water, the number of oxygen molecules in 36.0 grams of water is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of oxygen molecules} = 1.92 \\text{ molecules} \\times 2 = 3.84 \\text{ molecules} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the mass of oxygen that contains the same number of molecules as 3.84 molecules of oxygen. Since oxygen contains 2 molecules per molecule of water, we can find the mass of oxygen by dividing the number of oxygen molecules by 2:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of oxygen} = \\frac{3.84 \\text{ molecules}}{2} = 1.92 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 8.0 grams"
