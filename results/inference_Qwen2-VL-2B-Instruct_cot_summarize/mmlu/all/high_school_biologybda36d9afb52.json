                    "text": "To determine which inference(s) about the population might be true, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Population**: The population was never fewer than 30 squirrels and never more than 45 squirrels.\n   - This means the population was always between 30 and 45 squirrels.\n\n2. **Survival Rate**: Over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce.\n   - This implies that the survival rate was less than 50%.\n\n3. **Population Increase**: In a single generation, 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, and the population increased to 80 squirrels.\n   - This indicates that the population grew by 10 squirrels in a single generation.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The amount of available food may have increased**:\n   - The population increased from 30 to 80 squirrels in a single generation, which suggests that the food supply may have increased. This is a plausible inference.\n\nB. **The number of predators may have decreased**:\n   - The population increased from 30 to 80 squirrels in a single generation, which suggests that the number of predators may have decreased. This is also a plausible inference.\n\nC. **The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive**:\n   - This inference is based on the fact that 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, implying that the population is increasing. If the population is increasing, it suggests that the genetic diversity is increasing. This is a plausible inference.\n\nD. **A, B, and C**:\n   - All three options (A, B, and C) are plausible inferences based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct inference(s) about this population might be true are:\n\n**D.
