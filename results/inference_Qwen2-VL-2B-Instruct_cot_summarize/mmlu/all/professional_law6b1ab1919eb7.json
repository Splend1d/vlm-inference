In an accompanying letter, the owner instructed the newspaper to publish the ad in an upcoming edition. The ad was received by the newspaper's advertising editor. The next day the editor phoned the owner and told her that he would not permit the newspaper to run the ad. When the owner asked for an explanation, the editor replied, \"My daughter took your review course and scored low on her entrance exams to college and didn't get into the college of her choice. Because of your instructors, she's now working at the mall. That's why I'm prohibiting the newspaper from publishing your ad. \" The editor then forwarded a letter to the owner reiterating his newspaper's refusal to have the ad published. In an appropriate action, the owner brings suit against the editor and the newspaper seeking an order that would require the newspaper to publish the advertisement. In such action, who will prevail?\n\nA. The owner, because such advertising is protected by the First Amendment under the commercial speech doctrine.\nB. The owner, because there is a constitutional right of advertising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nC. The editor and newspaper, because Congress is empowered to prohibit untruthful advertising, even where it urges the purchase of a legal, validly offered item.\nD. The editor and newspaper, because there is no constitutional right of advertising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n"

The editor and newspaper, because Congress is empowered to prohibit untruthful advertising, even where it urges the purchase of a legal, validly offered item.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and press, but it does not specifically protect advertising that is false or misleading. The Fourteenth Amendment, on the other hand, does protect the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be informed of the truth of any statement made in a lawsuit. In this case, the newspaper's refusal to run the advertisement is based on the editor's personal experience with the student who took the review course and scored low on her entrance exams, which is not a statement of fact that can be proven in court. Therefore, the newspaper's refusal to run the advertisement is not protected by the First Amendment, and the owner can bring suit against the newspaper and the editor for violating their First Amendment rights."
