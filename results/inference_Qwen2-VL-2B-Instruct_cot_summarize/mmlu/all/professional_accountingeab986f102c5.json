Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n"

This means that Long was authorized to act on behalf of Frost, and his actions were within the scope of his authority.\n\n2. **Validity of the Order**: The key point here is whether the order placed with Grant Corp. was valid. Since Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost, it is reasonable to assume that Long had the necessary authority to place the order on behalf of Frost.\n\n3. **Legal Representative**: Frost's legal representative is the person who is authorized to act on behalf of Frost in legal matters. In this case, Frost's legal representative is Frost himself.\n\nGiven that Long had express authority to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers and conducted business on the Internet, it is reasonable to conclude that Long had the necessary authority to place the order with Grant Corp. on behalf of Frost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.**"
