(i), (ii), and (iv) only\n\nThis is because Monte Carlo studies are typically used with a large number of replications to ensure that the results are statistically robust and not affected by random fluctuations. When the number of replications is small, the results may be more susceptible to unrepresentative combinations of random draws, and the standard errors on the estimated quantities may be unacceptably large. Variance reduction techniques can be used to reduce the standard errors, but this is not a direct consequence of having a small number of replications."
