                    "text": "In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail\n\nA. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\nB. if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\nC. if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\nD. because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n"

Here's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. **Because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.**\n   - This option suggests that the tenant's failure to pay rent after the landowner's death is the basis for the Girl Scouts' claim. However, the will specifically mentioned the apartment building as part of the estate, and the tenant's continued occupancy after the landowner's death does not necessarily mean that the tenant's lease was still in effect. The will's exclusion of the apartment building from the estate means that the tenant's claim to the apartment is based on the will, not the lease.\n\nB. **If the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.**\n   - This option suggests that the tenant's lease was valid and in effect during the period of military service. However, the will specifically mentioned the apartment building as part of the estate, and the tenant's continued occupancy after the landowner's death does not necessarily mean that the tenant's lease was still in effect. The will's exclusion of the apartment building from the estate means that the tenant's claim to the apartment is based on the will, not the lease.\n\nC. **If the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.**\n   - This option suggests that the tenant believed that the lease was still in effect after the landowner's death. However, the will specifically mentioned the apartment building as part of the estate, and the tenant's continued occupancy after the landowner's death does not necessarily mean that the tenant's lease was still in effect.

However, the will specifically mentioned the apartment building as part of the estate, and the tenant's continued occupancy after the landowner's death does not necessarily mean that the tenant's lease was still in effect. The will's exclusion of the apartment building from the estate means that the tenant's claim to the apartment is based on the will, not the lease.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the tenant's failure to pay rent after the landowner's death is the basis for the Girl Scouts' claim."
