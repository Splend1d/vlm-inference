Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which trait most classical empires shared, let's analyze the given information and the options provided:\n\n1. **Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon**\n   - The passage discusses the decline of Rome due to its own immoderate greatness and the consequences of its conquests. It mentions the rise of the principle of decay, the multiplication of causes of destruction, and the eventual collapse of the empire due to its own weight.\n\n2. **Classical empires** are known for their vast territorial expansion and the integration of conquered peoples into their empires. This integration often involved cultural assimilation, which was a common trait among classical empires.\n\n3. **Option Analysis:**\n   - **A. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.**\n     - This aligns with the passage's description of the rise of the principle of decay due to the assimilation of conquered peoples, which led to the oppression of the freedom of the republic and the violation of the majesty of the purple.\n   - **B. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.**\n     - The passage does not mention state support of foreign religions, so this option is not relevant.\n   - **C. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.**\n     - The passage does not discuss public works projects, so this option is not relevant.\n   - **D. They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.**\n     - The passage does not mention government bureaucracies based on the merit principle, so this option is not relevant.\n\nBased on the analysis, the trait most closely associated with classical empires is **A. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.**"
