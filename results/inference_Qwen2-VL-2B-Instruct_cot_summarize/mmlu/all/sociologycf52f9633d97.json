This is because tourism is a voluntary activity, and individuals choose to travel to different countries for various reasons, such as sightseeing, work, or personal reasons. The exploitation of cheap, unregulated labour in poor countries is a result of forced labor, human trafficking, and other forms of exploitation, which are not consequences of global tourism."
