(ii) and (iv) only\n\nExplanation:\n- Adjusted R-squared is not an information criterion, it is a measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by an independent variable or set of independent variables in a regression model.\n- If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall. This is because the information criterion is designed to penalize models that are too complex, so adding more terms will decrease the value of the information criterion.\n- Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is consistent, meaning that as the sample size increases, the AIC will converge to the true value of the information criterion. Schwarz's information criterion (SIC) is also consistent, but it is not as commonly used as AIC.\n- Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion. This is because AIC is designed to be less conservative than SIC, meaning that it is less likely to overfit the data."
