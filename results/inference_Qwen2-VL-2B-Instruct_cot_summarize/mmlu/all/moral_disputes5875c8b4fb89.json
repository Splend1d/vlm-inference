This means that the moral status of living beings is not limited to humans but extends to all living creatures, including those that are not human. The primary bearers of direct moral standing are ecosystems in virtue of their functional integrity, which means that the moral status of ecosystems is based on their ability to function and provide for the needs of their inhabitants."
