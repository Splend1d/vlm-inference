The restaurant's owner, however, admits that the chowder was not homemade but was instead poured from a can of chowder purchased from a wholesale distributor of food products. \n\nGiven this information, the customer's complaint is based on the premise that the chowder was not homemade, which is a material fact that could reasonably be expected to be disclosed by a reasonable consumer.
