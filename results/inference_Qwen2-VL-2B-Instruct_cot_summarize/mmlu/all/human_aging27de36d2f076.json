Disenchantment\n\nDisenchantment is the phase where individuals start to feel disillusioned with their life choices and goals, leading to a sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction. This phase is often associated with the end of a long-term relationship or career, and it is less common to experience it in the context of retirement. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Disenchantment."
