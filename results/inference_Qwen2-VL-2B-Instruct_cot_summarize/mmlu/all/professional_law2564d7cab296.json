The jury returned a verdict for the truck driver, and the court entered judgment. The motorcyclist then sued the company that employed the driver and owned the truck in federal court for personal-injury damages, and the company moved to dismiss based on the state-court judgment. If the court grants the company's motion, what is the likely explanation?\n\nA. Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\nB. Issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) establishes the company's lack of negligence.\nC. The motorcyclist violated the doctrine of election of remedies.\nD. The state-court judgment is the law of the case.\n"

Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\n\nIn legal terms, \"claim preclusion\" or \"res judicata\" refers to the doctrine that prevents a party from bringing a new lawsuit that is based on the same facts as a previously decided case. If the court grants the company's motion to dismiss based on the state-court judgment, it would mean that the state court's judgment is binding on the federal court, and the federal court would not be able to hear the motorcyclist's federal lawsuit. This would likely result in the federal court dismissing the motorcyclist's federal lawsuit as well."
