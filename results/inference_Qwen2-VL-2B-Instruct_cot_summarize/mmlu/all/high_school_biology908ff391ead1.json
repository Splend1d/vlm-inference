Therefore, the probability of a carrier having the trait is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, and the probability of a carrier not having the trait is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\nThe probability of a carrier having the trait is 1/4, and the probability of a carrier not having the trait is 1/4. Therefore, the probability of a carrier having the trait and not expressing the trait is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the percent of the population that are carriers but do not express the trait is 1/16 * 100% = 16.67%, which is closest to 18%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B."
