During the party, the defendant invited the victim into his bedroom to show her his tattoos. When she entered his bedroom, the defendant ripped off her blouse and threw her onto his bed. He then jumped on the victim and tried to pull off her skirt. When the victim began to scream, some of the guests rushed into the bedroom and pulled the defendant off the victim. At trial, the defendant testified that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with the victim but he believed that she was consenting. The defendant further testified that he had consumed a pint of whiskey earlier in the evening and was intoxicated at the time the incident occurred. If the jury believes that the victim did not consent but also believes that the defendant, in his intoxicated state, honestly believed that she was consenting, the defendant should be found\n\nA. guilty, because consent is determined by the objective manifestations of the victim and not the subjective beliefs of the defendant.\nB. guilty, because voluntary intoxication is no defense.\nC. not guilty, because he honestly believed that she was consenting.\nD. not guilty, because his belief that she was consenting was reasonable.\n"

The key issue here is whether the jury should consider the defendant's subjective belief that the victim was consenting as a defense to the charge of attempted rape.\n\nThe defendant's argument hinges on the distinction between objective consent and subjective belief. Objective consent is determined by the actions and behavior of the victim, while subjective belief is based on the defendant's subjective perception of the victim's actions and intentions.\n\nIn this case, the defendant's subjective belief that the victim was consenting is a defense to the charge of attempted rape. The jury must consider whether the defendant's subjective belief that the victim was consenting was reasonable and not based on any objective manifestation of consent.\n\nIf the jury believes that the victim did not consent but also believes that the defendant, in his intoxicated state, honestly believed that she was consenting, the defendant should be found not guilty because his subjective belief that she was consenting was reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. not guilty, because his belief that she was consenting was reasonable."
