On October 31, the owner entered into a written contract with a worker that provided that the worker would be employed for the months of November and December to work at the retail store for $2,000 per month. At the end of November, the owner noticed that business had not increased as much as he had expected. The owner informed the worker that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, he would be fired. Reluctantly, on December 1, the worker orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 for the month of December. Which of the following statements regarding the December 1 agreement between the owner and the worked is most accurate?\n\nA. It effectuated a valid reformation of their original written contract.\nB. It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.\nC. It effectuated a novation of their original written contract.\nD. It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n"

It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n\nA valid reformation of a contract occurs when a court finds that the original contract was not properly executed or was not enforceable and orders the parties to agree to a new contract that is valid and enforceable. A valid modification of a contract occurs when one party agrees to change the terms of the contract, but it does not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of the original contract.\n\nA novation of a contract occurs when one party agrees to transfer the rights and obligations of the contract to another party, but it does not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of the original contract.\n\nIn this case, the owner and the worker agreed to a salary reduction of $500 for December, but this did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract. The original contract provided for a salary of $2,000 per month for November and December, and the worker agreed to work for that amount. The reduction in salary was a unilateral agreement by the worker, and it did not alter the terms of the original contract. Therefore, the statement regarding the December 1 agreement is most accurate."
