                    "text": "A plumbing company hired a worker to work at various construction sites. The worker used his own truck to travel between the company's warehouse and the construction sites, but the company fitted the truck with a rack for carrying plumbing pipes. The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.\nB. No, because the worker was an independent contractor.\nC. Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.\nD. Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.\n"

Let's analyze each option in detail:\n\nA. **No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.**\n   - This option suggests that the company's duty to hire a competent driver only applies to the worker's actions while on the job. However, the worker's representation of his license status was made before the accident, which occurred while the worker was driving to work. The company's duty to hire a competent driver extends to all actions taken by the worker, including those outside the scope of employment.\n\nB. **No, because the worker was an independent contractor.**\n   - This option suggests that the worker was an independent contractor, which means the company had no duty to hire a competent driver. However, the worker was hired by the company, and the company had a duty to hire a competent driver.\n\nC. **Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.**\n   - This option suggests that the company's duty to hire a competent driver extended to the worker's actions, including the use of the truck's rack for carrying plumbing pipes. However, the company's duty to hire a competent driver extends to all actions taken by the worker, including those outside the scope of employment.\n\nD. **Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.**\n   - This option suggests that the company had a duty to hire a competent driver, regardless of the worker's representation. The company's duty to hire a competent driver extends to all actions taken by the worker, including those outside the scope of employment.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.**\n\nThe company had a duty to hire a competent driver, and the worker's representation of his license status was made before the accident, which occurred while the worker was driving to work. Therefore, the company had a duty to ensure that the worker had a valid driver's license, and the worker's representation was not sufficient to absolve the company of its duty to hire a competent driver."
