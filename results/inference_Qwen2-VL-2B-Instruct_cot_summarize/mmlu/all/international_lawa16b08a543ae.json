Instead, it is considered a form of abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings. This is because the abduction is not a legal issue that can be resolved by the courts, but rather a matter of international law that requires the cooperation of the abducting country and the country where the abduction occurred. Therefore, the courts will not stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction."
