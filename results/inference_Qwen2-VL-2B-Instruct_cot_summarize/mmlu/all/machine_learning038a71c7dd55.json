The kernel density estimator is a method for estimating the probability density function of a random variable, while kernel regression is a method for estimating the conditional mean of a random variable given some other variables.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The depth of a learned decision tree can be larger than the number of training examples used to create the tree. This is because a decision tree can have multiple splits at each node, and each split can be further divided into smaller nodes, leading to a larger depth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
