In accordance with the statute, the President was authorized to appoint a majority of six members to the agency, and the other three positions were to be filled by the Senate. The nine members were duly appointed to the agency, and all appointees were subsequently approved in confirmation hearings. Thereafter, the agency issued the following regulations:(a) Requiring each motor vehicle operating in the United States to be equipped with a specified air/fuel control device;(b) Requiring each gas or oil furnace located in the United States to be fitted with a specified device to reduce emissions;(c) Requiring each State to establish and maintain a program under which each vehicle and each furnace shall be tested annually for compliance with federal emissions standards. Which of the following arguments would provide the strongest constitutional grounds against the authority of the statute?\n\nA. The President does not have the constitutional power to appoint a majority of members to an administrative agency.\nB. Congress does not have the executive authority to appoint members to an administrative agency.\nC. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.\nD. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\n"

The key here is to identify the constitutional limitations that Congress and the President have on the creation and enforcement of regulations.\n\n1. **Identify the type of argument**: The argument should focus on the constitutional authority of the President and Congress to create and enforce regulations.\n\n2. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"The President does not have the constitutional power to appoint a majority of members to an administrative agency.\"\n     - This argument is about the President's authority to appoint members, not the authority to promulgate regulations. It does not address the constitutional authority of Congress or the President to promulgate regulations.\n   - **Option B**: \"Congress does not have the executive authority to appoint members to an administrative agency.\"\n     - This argument is about the authority of Congress to create agencies, not the authority of the President to enforce regulations. It does not address the constitutional authority of the President to promulgate regulations.\n   - **Option C**: \"An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.\"\n     - This argument is about the authority of the President to promulgate regulations, not the authority of Congress to create agencies. It does not address the constitutional authority of the President to promulgate regulations.\n   - **Option D**: \"An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\"\n     - This argument directly addresses the constitutional authority of the President to promulgate regulations. It suggests that the authority to require states to supervise federal guidelines is not within the constitutional authority of the President.\n\nGiven this analysis, the strongest constitutional grounds against the authority of the statute are provided by Option D.\n\n**Final Answer: D. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).**"
