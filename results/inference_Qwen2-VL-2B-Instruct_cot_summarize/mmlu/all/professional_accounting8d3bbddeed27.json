It is calculated as the covariance between the stock's returns and the market index returns, divided by the covariance between the market index returns and the market index returns.\n\nThe formula for beta is:\n\n\u03b2 = Covariance(A, M) / Covariance(M, M)\n\nwhere A is the stock, M is the market index, and Covariance(A, M) is the covariance between the stock's returns and the market index returns.\n\nGiven that the covariance between Stock A and the market index is 88, and the standard deviations of the stock and the market index are 19% and 14% respectively, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\u03b2 = 88 / (19% * 14%)\n\n\u03b2 = 88 / 2.76\n\n\u03b2 \u2248 3.19\n\nTherefore, the beta of Stock A is approximately 0.35, which corresponds to option B."
