They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. . . .\n\"It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.\"\n\u2014Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address, January 21, 1981\nThe conservative political revival that led to President Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 held the view that\n\nA. political leaders in the 1960s and 1970s did not do enough to challenge the racial and economic status quo.\nB. the United States had relied too heavily on military solutions and needed to pursue a more isolationist foreign policy.\nC. religious leaders had become too assertive in governmental policy and had blurred the separation of church and state.\nD. liberal laws and court decisions in the 1960s and a general moral decline were undermining the United States.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and the core message of the passage provided by Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe passage discusses the economic challenges faced by the United States over several decades and the need for a change in government policies to address these issues. It emphasizes the importance of preserving freedom and the need for a more effective government to address the problems.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Political leaders in the 1960s and 1970s did not do enough to challenge the racial and economic status quo.\n- This option suggests a lack of action by political leaders during those decades. However, the passage does not mention any specific actions taken by political leaders during those periods. It focuses on the need for change and the importance of preserving freedom.\n\nB. The United States had relied too heavily on military solutions and needed to pursue a more isolationist foreign policy.\n- This option suggests a focus on military solutions and a shift towards isolationism. The passage does not mention any specific policies related to military solutions or isolationism.\n\nC. Religious leaders had become too assertive in governmental policy and had blurred the separation of church and state.\n- This option suggests a concern about the influence of religious leaders in governmental policy. The passage does not address the role of religious leaders in governmental policy or the separation of church and state.\n\nD. Liberal laws and court decisions in the 1960s and a general moral decline were undermining the United States.\n- This option suggests that liberal laws and court decisions in the 1960s and a general moral decline were the root cause of the economic ills. The passage does not mention any specific liberal laws or court decisions but does emphasize the need for change and the importance of preserving freedom.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage does not directly address the specific actions taken by political leaders or the influence of religious leaders in governmental policy. It focuses on the need for change and the preservation of freedom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. political leaders in the 1960s and 1970s did not do enough to challenge the racial and economic status quo."
