Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it is land that would be fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber. The grantor conveyed his tract to his brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother's cutting of the timber on the section of tract suitable for cultivation would be an example of\n\nA. permissive waste.\nB. ameliorative waste.\nC. equitable waste.\nD. unreasonable exploitation.\n"

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the options provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The grantor conveyed his 1,000-acre tract of land to his brother for life. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. The brother also cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, becoming the first person to exploit this area.\n\n2. **Identifying the Types of Waste**:\n   - **Permissive Waste**: This occurs when a person uses land for a purpose that is not intended or required by the landowner. In this case, the brother used the land for timber extraction, which was not intended for cultivation.\n   - **Ameiliorative Waste**: This occurs when a person uses land for a purpose that is beneficial to the landowner but not for the intended purpose. In this case, the brother cleared the timber on the section suitable for cultivation, which was beneficial to the landowner but not for the intended purpose of cultivation.\n   - **Equitable Waste**: This occurs when a person uses land for a purpose that is beneficial to the landowner but not for the intended purpose. In this case, the brother cleared the timber on the swampland, which was beneficial to the landowner but not for the intended purpose of cultivating crops.\n   - **Unreasonable Exploitation**: This occurs when a person uses land for a purpose that is unreasonable or excessive. In this case, the brother cleared 60 acres of timber in the swampland, which was unreasonable and excessive.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The brother's cutting of the timber on the section of tract suitable for cultivation would be an example of **equitable waste**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. equitable waste.**"
