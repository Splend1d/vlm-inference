Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( f(c) = f(d) \\)\n- This is possible if the line is a straight line passing through the points \\( (c, f(c)) \\) and \\( (d, f(d)) \\). Since the slope is constant, the line will pass through the origin if \\( c \\neq d \\), and it will be a horizontal line if \\( c = d \\). Therefore, this statement is possible.\n\nB. \\( f(c) \\neq f(d) \\)\n- This is also possible if the line is not a straight line, such as a curve or a line with a slope that changes. Therefore, this statement is possible.\n\nC. \\( f(c) > f(d) \\)\n- This is possible if the line is a decreasing function, meaning as \\( x \\) increases, \\( y \\) decreases. Therefore, this statement is possible.\n\nD. \\( f(c) < f(d) \\)\n- This is possible if the line is an increasing function, meaning as \\( x \\) increases, \\( y \\) increases. Therefore, this statement is possible.\n\nGiven that \\( c < d \\), we need to determine which of the options must be false. Since the slope of the line is constant and the function is linear, the line will pass through the origin if \\( c \\neq d \\). Therefore, the line will be a horizontal line if \\( c = d \\).\n\nThus, the line will be a horizontal line if \\( c = d \\), which means \\( f(c) = f(d) \\). Therefore, the statement that must be false is:\n\n**B. \\( f(c) \\neq f(d) \\)**\n\nFinal answer: B. \\( f(c) \\neq f(d) \\)"
