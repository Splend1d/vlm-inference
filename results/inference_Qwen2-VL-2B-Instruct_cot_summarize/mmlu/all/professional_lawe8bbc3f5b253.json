The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. \"Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?\n\nA. Voluntary Manslaughter\nB. First Degree Murder\nC. Second Degree Murder\nD. Involuntary Manslaughter\n"

Voluntary Manslaughter involves a defendant's premeditated intent to cause death, while Second Degree Murder involves a defendant's premeditated intent to cause death but with less intent than First Degree Murder. Involuntary Manslaughter involves a defendant's premeditated intent to cause death but with less intent than First Degree Murder. The businessman did not have the specific intent to premeditate for First Degree Murder, which is the most severe charge in this scenario."
