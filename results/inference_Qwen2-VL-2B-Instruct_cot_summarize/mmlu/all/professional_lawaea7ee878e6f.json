The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. The manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 right away. The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract. Defendant buyer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the statute of frauds was violated in that it was a contract for over $500 that was unenforceable under state law. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\nC. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule.\n"

However, the statute of frauds is not applicable here because the widgets were specially made for the buyer, which is an exception to the general rule.\n\n2. **Manufacturer's Bad Business Practices**: The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. This rushed delivery could be considered a breach of contract, but it does not necessarily mean the statute of frauds is violated.\n\n3. **Benefit of the Bargain**: The court will likely enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule, which means the contract will be enforced even if it involves goods over $500 if the benefit of the bargain is substantial.\n\nGiven these points, the court is more likely to grant the motion to dismiss the complaint because the statute of frauds does not apply here due to the special nature of the widgets being made for the buyer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule."
