This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves neglecting the needs of an elderly person who is unable to care for themselves. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) put the clogged hair from the shower drain into the tub in their stepmom's bathroom. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a common household chore that is necessary for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene."
