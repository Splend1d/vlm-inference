By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nC. Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\nD. How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most closely related large-scale question about global history to the given passage, let's analyze the context and core of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the historical context of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, focusing on the differences in their use and effectiveness against their respective threats. It highlights the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and their effectiveness in sieges, while China's efforts were directed towards improving horse archer units against nomadic steppe threats.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other**\n   - This option is not directly related to the passage. The passage does not discuss the sharing of technologies between societies but rather the development and effectiveness of specific technologies in different regions.\n\nB. **Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era**\n   - This option is relevant because the passage discusses the development of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and its impact on military superiority over non-Western powers. It aligns with the argument that European states gained military superiority due to advancements in weaponry.\n\nC. **Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.**\n   - This option is not related to the passage. The passage does not discuss the decline of Silk Road commerce or the reasons behind it.\n\nD. **How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion**\n   - This option is not relevant to the passage. The passage does not discuss the climatic optimum or cultural diffusion.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the passage most closely relates to the question about why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\n**Final Answer: B. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era**"
