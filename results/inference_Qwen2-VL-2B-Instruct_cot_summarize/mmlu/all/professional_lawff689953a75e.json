Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?\n\nA. The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.\nB. The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.\nC.

The owner's defense would argue that the materials in question are not obscene because they depict normal, non-deviant sexual conduct.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.**\n   - This option suggests that the materials in question are not obscene because they depict normal, non-deviant sexual conduct. This would be helpful to the owner's defense because it would argue that the materials are not obscene because they do not depict deviant or deviant sexual conduct.\n\nB. **The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.**\n   - This option suggests that the materials in question are not obscene because they are scientific studies. However, this does not directly address the issue of obscenity. The owner's defense would need to focus on the content of the materials, not the nature of the scientific studies.\n\nC. **The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.**\n   - This option suggests that the police did not have a legal basis for entering the bookstore, which could be relevant if the police had a warrant and the materials were seized without a warrant. However, this does not directly address the issue of obscenity.\n\nD. **85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.**\n   - This option suggests that the public opinion on the sale of sexually explicit material is not negative. However, it does not directly address the issue of obscenity. The owner's defense would need to focus on the content of the materials, not public opinion.\n\nGiven the context and the focus on the nature of the materials, the most helpful option for the owner's defense would be:\n\n**A. The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the core issue of whether the materials are obscene by distinguishing between normal and deviant sexual conduct."
