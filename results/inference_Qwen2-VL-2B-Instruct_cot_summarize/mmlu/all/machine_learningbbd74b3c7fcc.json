The polynomial degree\n\nIn polynomial regression, the degree of the polynomial (the highest power of the independent variable) affects the complexity of the model. A higher degree polynomial can fit more complex patterns in the data, but it also increases the risk of overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Therefore, the polynomial degree is the key structural assumption that influences the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting."
