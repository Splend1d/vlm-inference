An open elevator, which had been installed in the building by the elevator manufacturer, was used to haul workers and building materials between floors. While the worker was riding the elevator, it stalled between floors due to a manufacturing defect in the elevator. The worker called for assistance and was in no danger, but after waiting 15 minutes for help, he became anxious and jumped 12 feet to get out. He severely injured his back when he landed. In an action by the worker against the elevator manufacturer to recover for his back injury, is the worker likely to obtain a judgment for 100% of his damages?\n\nA. No, because such risks are inherent in construction work.\nB. No, because the worker was not in danger while on the stalled elevator. while on the stalled elevator.\nC. Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect.\nD. Yes, because the worker was falsely imprisoned in the stalled elevator.\n"

The worker was not in danger while on the stalled elevator, and the elevator manufacturer is responsible for the defect that caused the stall. Therefore, the worker is likely to obtain a judgment for 100% of his damages, as the manufacturer's negligence is the primary cause of the injury.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect."
