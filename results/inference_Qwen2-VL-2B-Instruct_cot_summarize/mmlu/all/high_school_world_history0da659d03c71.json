The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich conclusion is supported by the passage?\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct conclusion supported by the passage, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. The passage describes a slave trade caravan in Algeria in the 1830s, where soldiers were instructed to hunt and capture black Africans.\n2. The soldiers were divided into two companies and were ordered to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seize all peasants busy cultivating their fields.\n3. The soldiers were instructed to buy slaves at specific prices, with the prices varying based on the attractiveness of the slaves.\n4. The passage mentions that the caravan had sixty-four camels and sixteen persons, but was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\n   - The passage does not provide any information about the slaves' reactions or acceptance. It only describes the actions taken by the soldiers.\n\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\n   - The passage does not provide any information about the origin of the slaves captured. It only describes the actions taken by the soldiers.\n\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\n   - The passage does not provide any information about the gender distribution of the slaves captured. It only describes the actions taken by the soldiers.\n\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due terms of physical strength.\n   - The passage mentions that adult male slaves were valued at 45,000 cowries, while adult female slaves were valued at 35\u201340,000 cowries. This suggests that adult male slaves were considered more valuable.\n\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion that is supported by the passage is:\n\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued in terms of physical strength."
