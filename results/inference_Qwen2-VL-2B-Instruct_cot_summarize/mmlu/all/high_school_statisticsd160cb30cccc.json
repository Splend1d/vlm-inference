It is influenced by the significance level (\u03b1) and the sample size (n).\n\nThe power of the test is maximized when the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is more extreme than the null hypothesis (H0). In this case, Ha is \u03bc < 70, which is a more extreme statement than H0 = \u03bc = 70.\n\nGiven that \u03bc = 65, the alternative hypothesis is \u03bc < 65. Therefore, the power of the test will be maximized when the significance level is 0.05 and the sample size is 30.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30"
