Case material may be discussed with colleagues concerned with the case only when a formal release of information has been obtained from the client.\n\nExplanation: Confidentiality is a fundamental principle in the field of psychology and healthcare, ensuring that information about clients is kept private and protected. It is important to maintain confidentiality to respect the privacy and autonomy of clients, and to avoid the misuse of information. Therefore, it is essential to obtain explicit consent from clients before sharing information about them with others, and to only discuss information with colleagues who have a formal release of information from the client."
