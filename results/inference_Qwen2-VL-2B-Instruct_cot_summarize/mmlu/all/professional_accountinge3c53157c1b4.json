Therefore, the cash disbursements for purchases should be the amount of cash on hand at the end of June, which is -$100,000.\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of cash disbursements for purchases:**\n\n   - Cash on hand at the end of June = -$100,000\n   - Cash disbursements for purchases = $1,600,000 - $100,0000 = $500,000\n\nTherefore, the amount Star should budget for cash disbursements for June purchases is $500,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. $340,000"
