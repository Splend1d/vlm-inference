This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid.

                    "text": "To determine the best explanation for the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisting on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line, we need to analyze the context and the purpose of the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was a significant maritime boundary agreement between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Kingdom of Castile and Aragon. The treaty divided the known world into two equal parts, with Portugal controlling the western hemisphere and Castile and Aragon controlling the eastern hemisphere. The key point of contention was the maritime boundary between the two hemispheres.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism.\n- This option is not relevant to the Treaty of Tordesillas, which was about maritime boundaries, not religious conversions.\n\nB. The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World.\n- This option is also not relevant to the Treaty of Tordesillas, which was about maritime boundaries, not the discovery of the New World.\n\nC. The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.\n- This option aligns well with the Treaty of Tordesillas. The treaty was intended to prevent Portugal from expanding westward and to maintain the independence of Native states in the New World, which would have been a significant buffer against Portuguese expansion.\n\nD. The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World.\n- This option is not relevant to the Treaty of Tordesillas, which was about maritime boundaries, not the conquest of India.\n\nGiven the context and the purpose of the Treaty of Tordesillas, the best explanation for the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisting on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line is:\n\nC. The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.\n\nFinal answer: C. The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion."
