Yes, conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.\n\nConversion occurs when one person takes another's property without their consent, and the property is converted into something different. In this scenario, the pizza owner is intentionally taking over the burger restaurant's business, which is a conversion of the burger restaurant's property. The owner of the burger restaurant has the right to his personal property, and the conversion is intentional and has caused harm to his business.\n\nTherefore, the owner of the burger restaurant can sue for conversion against the pizza owner."
