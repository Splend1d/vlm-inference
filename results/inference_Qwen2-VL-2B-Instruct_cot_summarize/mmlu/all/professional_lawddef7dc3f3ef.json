Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it would be land fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber and has clearings where someone could build a home and live. The woman conveyed the tract to her brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother then proceeded to clear some timber on the tract and used it in repairing fences, buildings, equipment, and the like on the property. In an action by the woman to permanently enjoin the brother from cutting any more timber on the swampland section of the tract and to account for profits received in the sale of the timber, the woman will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because a life tenant must account for permissive waste to the reversioner or remainderman.\nB. succeed, because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no such prior use had been made.\nC. not succeed, because a life tenant is not liable for permissive waste.\nD. not succeed, because a life tenant has a right to make reasonable use of the land.\n"

The life tenant is responsible for accounting for any permissive waste that occurs on the land. In this case, the brother has exploited the swampland section of the tract, which is considered permissive waste. The woman will most likely succeed in her action to permanently enjoin the brother from cutting any more timber on the swampland section of the tract and to account for profits received in the sale of the timber.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. succeed, because a life tenant must account for permissive waste to the reversioner or remainderman."
