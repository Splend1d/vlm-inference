A congressional report revealed that in the certain parts of the country, only 42% of minorities eligible to vote were, in fact, registered. The report also indicated that certain states had residency laws restricting a person's right to vote. As a consequence, Congress enacted a statute that makes any law denying minorities the right to vote shall be deemed unconstitutional. This federal statute will most likely be upheld under which of the following constitutional provisions?\n\nA. Thirteenth Amendment.\nB. Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. Fifteenth Amendment.\nD. Twentieth Amendment.\n"

Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1870, prohibits the states from denying any person the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This amendment is often referred to as the \"Black Power Amendment\" because it was intended to protect the voting rights of African Americans.\n\nThe federal statute you mentioned, which makes any law denying minorities the right to vote unconstitutional, is likely to be upheld under the Fifteenth Amendment. This is because the Fifteenth Amendment specifically addresses the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude, which is the same issue addressed by the statute you mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Fifteenth Amendment."
