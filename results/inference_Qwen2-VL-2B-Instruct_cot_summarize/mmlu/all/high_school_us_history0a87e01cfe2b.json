This act was part of the broader effort to raise revenue to pay for the costs of the French and Indian War, which had been fought by the British against the French.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. He felt that the Crown needed to control trade and raise revenue.\n- This statement aligns with the purpose of the Sugar Act, which was to raise revenue to pay for the war.\n\nB. He felt that the colonists should help pay the debt incurred by the war.\n- This statement is not directly related to the Sugar Act. The Sugar Act was primarily aimed at raising revenue, not helping pay for the war.\n\nC. He felt that Parliament had the right to increase taxes on the colonies.\n- This statement is consistent with the purpose of the Sugar Act, which was to increase taxes to raise revenue.\n\nD. He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n- This statement is not directly related to the Sugar Act. The Sugar Act was primarily aimed at raising revenue, not rewarding the colonies.\n\nTherefore, the statement that does NOT represent the views of Prime Minister Grenville after the French and Indian War is:\n\nB. He felt that the colonists should help pay the debt incurred by the war."
