If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\nA. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\nB. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\nC.

The document discusses Louis XIV's court and his methods of enhancing favor and control over his courtiers.\n2. It mentions Louis XIV's love for splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and his encouragement of similar tastes in his Court.\n3. The document also highlights Louis XIV's ability to enhance favor by his manner of bestowing it, and his willingness to make favors and grants to courtiers.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n   - This option suggests that the bias is due to the duke's personal feelings towards the king. However, the document does not provide any indication that the duke is sympathetic to Louis XIV or has any personal feelings towards him.\n\nB. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n   - This option suggests that the bias is due to the duke's personal feelings against the king. However, the document does not provide any information about the duke's feelings towards the king or his suppression of the nobility.\n\nC. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n   - This option suggests that the bias is due to the duke's support for the central state's control over the population.

The document does provide information about Louis XIV's encouragement of similar tastes in his Court and his willingness to make favors and grants to courtiers, which aligns with the idea that the duke supported the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the question, the best explanation of the bias found in the document is:\n\nD.
