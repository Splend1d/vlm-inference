Instead, they are more likely to shape their own development by actively selecting the contexts in which they participate, imposing their subjective appraisal on the context, and affecting what takes place in the context. Conditioning refers to the process of altering behavior through exposure to certain stimuli, which is not typically a characteristic of children's development."
