Unbeknownst to the defendant, the woman had just stolen the briefcase from the man on the street. Believing the woman to be the victim of an attack, the defendant intervened and punched the man until the woman was able to get away with the briefcase.

The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man was both objectively and subjectively reasonable.\n"

According to this rule, a person is justified in using reasonable force to protect another person if they reasonably believe that the other person is in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm.\n\nIn the given scenario, the defendant intervened to protect the woman from the man, believing that the woman was in immediate danger of being attacked. This belief was objectively reasonable because the defendant saw the woman struggling with the man and believed that the man was the aggressor. Additionally, the defendant believed that the woman was in immediate danger of being attacked by the man, which was also objectively reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the defendant was justified in using reasonable force to protect the woman, as his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm was both objectively and subjectively reasonable.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man was both objectively and subjectively reasonable."
