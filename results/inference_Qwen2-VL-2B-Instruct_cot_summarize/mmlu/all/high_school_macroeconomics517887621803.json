                    "text": "The correct answer is C. A decrease in taxes and selling bonds in an open market operation.\n\nWhen the government decreases taxes and sells bonds in an open market operation, it injects money into the economy, which can lead to an increase in aggregate demand. This increase in aggregate demand can push the economy towards full employment real GDP, as seen in the example where current real GDP is $50,000 and full employment real GDP is at $40,000. Therefore, option C is the most likely combination of policies to have brought the economy to this point."
