This is a fundamental principle of the U.S. monetary system, which is based on the idea that the value of the dollar is determined by the demand for and supply of U.S. dollars in the international financial system. The government's commitment to maintaining the value of the dollar is reflected in its monetary policy, which includes setting interest rates, regulating the money supply, and controlling the flow of foreign exchange."
