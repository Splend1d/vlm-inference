One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n"

However, the consumer's claim here is based on the car dealer's failure to perform a thorough inspection before selling the car, which is a breach of duty of care. \n\nThe consumer asserts that the brakes failed because of a defect present when he purchased the car, which is a breach of the car dealer's duty of care. The car dealer performed a thorough inspection before the sale, which means they had the opportunity to identify and address any defects before the sale. \n\nTherefore, the car dealer's failure to perform the inspection before the sale is the basis for the claim, not the failure of the brakes while the consumer was driving. The consumer's assertion of strict liability in tort is not supported by the facts of the case, and the car dealer's duty of care was not breached. \n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it."
