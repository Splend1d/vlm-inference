Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n"

The passage highlights that the operation of the imperialist system, which includes the exploitation of African resources and labor, is the primary cause of African underdevelopment.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\n- This option directly supports the idea that the operation of the imperialist system is responsible for African underdevelopment. It shows how the slave trade was a key mechanism for European exploitation.\n\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\n- This option supports the idea that African slaves were sold to European merchants, but it does not directly address the role of the imperialist system or the capitalist exploitation of African resources.\n\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\n- This option supports the idea that the Dutch East India Company was involved in the exploitation of African resources, but it does not directly address the role of the imperialist system or the capitalist exploitation of African resources.\n\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n- This option supports the idea that trade links were established between Europe and Ethiopia, but it does not directly address the role of the imperialist system or the capitalist exploitation of African resources.\n\nGiven the context provided, the option that best supports the author's assertion is:\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\n\nThis option directly supports the idea that the operation of the imperialist system is responsible for African underdevelopment by highlighting the role of the slave trade in European exploitation."
