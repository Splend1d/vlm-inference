The junction tree algorithm is a method for computing the marginal distribution of a set of variables, while variable elimination is a method for computing the joint distribution of a set of variables. The two methods can produce different results in some cases.\n\nStatement 2 is true because if two random variables X and Y are conditionally independent given another random variable Z, then in the corresponding Bayesian network, the nodes for X and Y are d-separated given Z. This is because in a Bayesian network, the nodes are connected by directed edges, and if two nodes are connected by an edge, then they are conditionally independent given the other node. Therefore, if X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, then they are also d-separated given Z.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
