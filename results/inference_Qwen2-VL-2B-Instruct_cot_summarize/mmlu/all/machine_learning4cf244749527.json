Shattering a set of points means that the set can be partitioned into two subsets such that the union of the two subsets contains all the points. However, the set of all rectangles in the 2D plane, including non-axis-aligned rectangles, cannot shatter a set of 5 points because it is not possible to partition the set into two subsets that cover all 5 points. The set of all rectangles is not a partition of the set of points.\n\nStatement 2: The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nThis statement is true. The VC-dimension of a classifier is the maximum number of points that can be shattered by the classifier. For a k-Nearest Neighbour classifier, the VC-dimension is infinite when k = 1, because it can shatter any set of points."
