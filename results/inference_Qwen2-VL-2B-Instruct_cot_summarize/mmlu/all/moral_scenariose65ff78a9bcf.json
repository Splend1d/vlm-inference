It involves theft and unauthorized entry into someone's property, which is generally considered illegal and unethical.\n\nIn scenario 2, adding extra sugar to a punch drink without anyone knowing is not morally wrong. This action is considered ethical because it is a harmless and non-intrusive act that does not harm anyone or violate any laws. It is a common practice in social gatherings and is generally accepted as a harmless and harmless behavior."
