Can the surviving wife enforce the automatic reverter putting title back in herself?\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\nC. Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari mutual.\nD. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the surviving wife can enforce the automatic reverter, we need to analyze the nature of the provision and the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Automatic Reverter**: An automatic reverter is a clause in a contract that automatically transfers ownership to the grantee if the property is mortgaged or encumbered within the life of the grantor. This clause is typically used to protect the grantor's interest in the property from being lost due to encumbrances.\n\n2. **Nature of the Contract**: The contract in question involves a part of the inherited family farm conveyed to the niece for consideration, with a reverter clause that provides that the property will revert to the grantors if mortgaged or encumbered within the life of either grantor. This clause is enforceable under the law of the country where the contract was made.\n\n3. **Surviving Wife's Interest**: The surviving wife is the grantee of the reverter clause. The grantor is the husband, and the grantee is the niece. The grantor and the grantee are blood relatives in pari mutuo, which means they are equally interested in the property.\n\n4. **Enforcement of the Automatic Reverter**: Generally, an automatic reverter clause is enforceable if it is not unreasonable and if the grantor and the grantee are blood relatives in pari mutuo. This is because the clause is designed to protect the grantor's interest in the property from being lost due to encumbrances.\n\nGiven these points, the surviving wife can enforce the automatic reverter clause because the grantor and the grantee are blood relatives in pari mutuo, and the clause is not unreasonable.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.**"
