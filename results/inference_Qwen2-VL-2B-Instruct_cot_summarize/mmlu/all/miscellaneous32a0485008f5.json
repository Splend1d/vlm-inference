Large-scale deforestation of the Amazon or Congo basin tropical forests\n\nLarge-scale deforestation has been identified as one of the primary drivers of biodiversity loss. It involves the removal of trees and other vegetation, leading to soil erosion, water pollution, and the loss of habitat for many species. This can have a significant impact on the ecosystem and the biodiversity it supports."
