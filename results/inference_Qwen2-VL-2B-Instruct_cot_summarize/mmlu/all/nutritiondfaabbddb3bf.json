Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD.\n\nIn the context of N-balance studies, the slope of the nitrogen balance curve is used to estimate the efficiency of protein utilization. However, this slope can vary between different individuals due to differences in adaptation. The safe individual protein requirement (EAR+2SD) is calculated to account for this variability, ensuring that the estimated efficiency of protein utilization is within a range that is safe for the individual. This approach helps to ensure that the calculated minimum protein requirement is reliable and applicable to the individual's specific adaptation pattern."
