As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.\n\nThe solar nebula, which is the initial state of the solar system, was a large, hot, and dense cloud of gas and dust. As the nebula collapsed, its gravitational potential energy was converted into kinetic energy, which caused the gas and dust to move faster and faster. This process is known as accretion, and it is the primary mechanism by which planets form in the solar nebula. The faster the gas and dust moved, the more energy they had, and the hotter they became. This process continued until the nebula had collapsed into a single planet or a few planets."
