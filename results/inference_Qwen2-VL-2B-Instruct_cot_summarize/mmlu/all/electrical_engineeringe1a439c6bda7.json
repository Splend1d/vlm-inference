The voltage measured by the voltmeter is 75 V. Therefore, the limiting error is 2 V - 75 V = -73 V. This is not possible, so the limiting error cannot be 2 V. The limiting error cannot be 1 V either, because the voltmeter is not capable of measuring voltages that are less than 0 V. Therefore, the limiting error must be between 2% and 2 V. The only option that fits this description is option B. Therefore, the limiting error is 2.66%. The correct answer is B."
