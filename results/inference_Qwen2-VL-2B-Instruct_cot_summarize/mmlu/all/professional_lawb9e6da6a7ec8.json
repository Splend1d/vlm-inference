I'll pay you $275 if you will change the oil, replace the oil filter, and adjust the carburetors by February 10. \"The mechanic received the man's letter on February 3. That same day, he telephoned an auto supply company and ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work. Two days later, the mechanic met the man at a party and this conversation took place:The man: \"Disregard the letter I sent you last week. \"The mechanic: \"No way, man, I already ordered the materials on from the auto supply company. \"The man: \"Sorry, but I sold my car yesterday, so forget the repair work. \"If the mechanic initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties?\n\nA. The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.\nB. The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.\nC. Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.\nD. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n"

Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The mechanic had already ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work on February 3.\n2. The man's offer was to pay $275 for the repair work, which the mechanic accepted by ordering the materials.\n3. The man's offer was to perform the repair work, which the mechanic had already agreed to do.\n4. The man revoked his offer by saying he had sold his car and therefore could not perform the repair work.\n5. The mechanic had not yet begun the requested acts of acceptance (ordering the materials) when the man revoked his offer.\n\nSince the mechanic had already agreed to perform the repair work and the man had revoked his offer, there was no contract formation. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
