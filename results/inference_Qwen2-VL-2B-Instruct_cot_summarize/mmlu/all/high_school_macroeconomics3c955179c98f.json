The equilibrium price will rise and the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nWhen the price of good X rises, which is a close substitute for good Z, the demand for good Z will decrease. This is because consumers will buy less of good Z as they can now buy more of good X with the same amount of money. As a result, the equilibrium price of good Z will rise to maintain the same level of demand. At the higher equilibrium price, the equilibrium quantity of good Z will fall."
