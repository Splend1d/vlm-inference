Murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThis is because the man's actions were motivated by a desire to protect his wife from the neighbor, which is a form of self-defense. However, the neighbor's death was not an accident or an unforeseen event, but rather a result of the man's intentional act. Therefore, the court should consider both the man's intent to protect his wife and the neighbor's death as a result of his actions, which would fall under the categories of murder and voluntary manslaughter."
