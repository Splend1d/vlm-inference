X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nB. Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nC. Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nD. Osmotic diuretic\n"

Osmotic diuretic\n\nOsmotic diuretics are used to increase the excretion of calcium in the urine, which can help to reduce the risk of recurrent calculi. Other options such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, Na+ -Cl\u2212 symport inhibitors, and Na+ -K + -2Cl\u2212 symport inhibitors are not appropriate because they do not directly affect calcium excretion."
