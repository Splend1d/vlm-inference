When it is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends'\n\nPiracy is defined as the illegal taking of a ship or vessel by force or threat of force, with the intent of selling the goods carried on board or of seizing the ship for the purpose of selling the goods. The key elements of piracy are the intent to seize the ship for the purpose of selling the goods carried on board, and the use of force or threat of force to achieve that purpose. \n\nWhen an illegal act of violence on the high seas falls short of qualifying as piracy, it must not be committed against another vessel or for 'private ends'. If the act is committed against a public vessel of another State, it is not piracy. If the act is committed for 'private ends', it is not piracy. If the act is committed by a warship even when its crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship, it is not piracy. If the act is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends', it is not piracy."
