Government must enforce the majority's will regardless of the wishes of the minority.\n\nBoth Thomas Hobbes and John Locke believed in the necessity of a strong central government to maintain order and protect the common good. Hobbes argued that the state of nature was chaotic and violent, and that a government was necessary to establish order and protect individuals from each other. Locke, on the other hand, believed that the government should be limited in its power and that the people should have the right to overthrow a government that fails to protect their rights. Both Hobbes and Locke would likely agree that the government must enforce the majority's will regardless of the wishes of the minority."
