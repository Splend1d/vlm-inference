Examination shows a 6-cm, soft, nontender left scrotal mass that transilluminates; there are no bowel sounds in the mass. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?\n\nA. Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue\nB. Cryptorchidism of the left testis\nC. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis\nD. Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis\n"

Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis\n\nThis is because the patient has a painless left scrotal mass that transilluminates, which is a characteristic of a varicocele. Varicoceles are dilations of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis, which can cause blood to flow back into the testis, leading to swelling and pain."
