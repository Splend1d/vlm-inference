For sets X and Y, we first need to sort them:\n\n- Set X: {10, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}\n- Set Y: {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}\n\nSorted lists:\n- Set X: {10, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}\n- Set Y: {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}\n\nThe median of X is 50, and the median of Y is 50.\n\n### Mean Calculation:\nThe mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. For sets X and Y:\n\n- Set X: 10 + 30 + 35 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90 = 400\n- Set Y: 10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90 = 400\n\nThe mean of X is 400 / 8 = 50, and the mean of Y is 400 / 8 = 50.\n\n### Range Calculation:\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. For sets X and Y:\n\n- Set X: 90 - 10 = 80\n- Set Y: 90 - 10 = 80\n\nThe range of X is 80, and the range of Y is 80.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The median of X and Y is the same (50).\n- The mean of X and Y is the same (50).\n- The range of X and Y is the same (80).\n\nTherefore, the statement that is false is:\n\nD. None of the above are false."
