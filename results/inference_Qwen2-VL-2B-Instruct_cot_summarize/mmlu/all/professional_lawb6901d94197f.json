The man took the agent to the home of a drug dealer, who sold the agent four pounds of marijuana. At trial, the drug dealer claimed the defense of entrapment and demanded that the informant's identity be disclosed and that he be produced. At no time prior to trial did the drug dealer seek to subpoena the man. However, the man was a fugitive from justice the whole time, and no subpoena could have been served. The government claims a right to protect the informant's identity. Should the government's claim be honored?\n\nA. Yes, because an informant has a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. Yes, because informants would not assist in crime prevention unless they were reasonably certain that their identities would be kept secret.\nC. No, because under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be confronted by witnesses against him.\nD. No, because under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to a fair trial.\n"

The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to informants, and the government has a right to protect the informant's identity. The government's claim is based on the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, which applies to informants as well as defendants. The government's claim is not based on the Sixth Amendment's right to a fair trial, which applies to defendants. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because an informant has a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination."
