Rock material carried deep below Earth's surface results in material melting and rising to the surface.\n\nVolcanoes tend to form along subduction zones because the plates that are subducting (moving downward) are often rich in magma. As these plates subduct, they bring with them magma from the Earth's mantle, which is heated by the planet's core. This magma then rises to the surface, forming volcanoes."
