For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\n\nThis statement is correct because it acknowledges that for an adult in nitrogen equilibrium, the body can meet its protein needs through the breakdown of its own protein, which is a process known as protein catabolism. This means that the requirement for dietary protein is not as significant as it might seem, as the body can produce enough protein from its own tissues."
