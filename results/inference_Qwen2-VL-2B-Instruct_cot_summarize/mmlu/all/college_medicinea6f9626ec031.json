Ethanol prefers the second carbon in any chain.\n\nIn the reaction of 2-bromobutane with ethanol, the reaction is likely to proceed via a nucleophilic substitution mechanism, where the bromide ion attacks the second carbon of the alkane. Ethanol, being a polar solvent, can preferentially interact with the second carbon of the alkane, leading to a more stable configuration. This preference for the second carbon in a chain is a common phenomenon in organic reactions, especially when the solvent is polar.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation for why 2-butene is the major product is:\n\nC. Ethanol prefers the second carbon in any chain."
