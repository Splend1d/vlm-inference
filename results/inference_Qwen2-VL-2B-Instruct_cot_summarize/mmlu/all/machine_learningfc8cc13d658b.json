RELUs (Rectified Linear Units) are indeed monotonic, meaning they are either always increasing or always decreasing. Sigmoids, on the other hand, are not monotonic; they are always increasing, but not always decreasing. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.\n- This statement is true. Neural networks trained using gradient descent, a common optimization technique, are designed to converge to the global optimum of the loss function. This is because gradient descent iteratively adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the loss, ensuring that the network learns the most generalizable solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
