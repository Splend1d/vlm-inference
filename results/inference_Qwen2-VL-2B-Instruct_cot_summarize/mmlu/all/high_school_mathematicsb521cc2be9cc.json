In this case, the common prime factors are 2 and 3.\n\nThe GCF is the product of the lowest power of each common prime factor. Here, the lowest power of 2 is \\(2^1\\) and the lowest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\).\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 252 and 96 is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n\nThe correct answer is A. 6."
