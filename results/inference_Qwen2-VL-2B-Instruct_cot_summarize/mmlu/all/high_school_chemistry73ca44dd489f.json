It is used to determine the activation energy of a reaction, which is the energy required for the reactants to overcome the activation barrier and become products. The Arrhenius equation is also used to determine the rate constant at various temperatures, which is the rate at which a reaction occurs at a given temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
