Similarly, a fabric factory periodically checks the sizes of towels coming off an assembly line and halts production if measurements are sufficiently off target. In both situations, we have the null hypothesis that the equipment is performing satisfactorily. For each situation, which is the more serious concern, a Type I or Type II error?\n\nA. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type I error\nB. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type II error\nC.

If the readings are sufficiently off target, it indicates a deviation from the expected performance, which is a Type I error. This means the dialysis center is more concerned about detecting a false positive (a Type I error) rather than a false negative (a Type II error).\n\nFor the towel manufacturer, the concern is more serious because the null hypothesis is that the sizes of towels are within acceptable limits. If the measurements are sufficiently off target, it indicates a deviation from the expected performance, which is a Type I error. This means the towel manufacturer is more concerned about detecting a false positive (a Type I error) rather than a false negative (a Type II error).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type I error"
