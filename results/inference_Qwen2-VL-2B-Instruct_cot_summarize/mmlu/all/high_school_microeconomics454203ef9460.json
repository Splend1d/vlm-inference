All of the above.\n\nDeadweight loss occurs in monopolistic competition, monopoly markets, and oligopoly markets because the price (P) is greater than the marginal cost (MC). In these markets, the monopolist or oligopolist has the power to set prices above marginal cost, leading to a situation where the market is not efficient. This results in a loss of efficiency and a reduction in the overall welfare of the market participants."
