This migration led to a significant increase in the number of African Americans in the city, who were often housed in ghettos. As a result, the black population remained in the city's ghettos, while the majority of other ethnic groups were integrated into mainstream society. This led to a multiculturalism in Chicago, where different ethnic groups coexisted and interacted with each other, but the black population remained marginalized and segregated."
