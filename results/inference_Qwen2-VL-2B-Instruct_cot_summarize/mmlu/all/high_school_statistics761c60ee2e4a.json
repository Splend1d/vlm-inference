It ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate a strong positive linear relationship, values close to -1 indicate a strong negative linear relationship, and values close to 0 indicate no linear relationship.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the correlation between two variables is r = 0.19. This means that there is a weak positive linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nNow, let's consider the changes that have been made to the variables:\n\n1. Adding 0.23 to all values of the x-variable: This will increase the value of the x-variable by 0.23. Since the correlation coefficient is based on the linear relationship between two variables, this will increase the correlation coefficient.\n\n2. Doubling every value of the y-variable: This will double the value of the y-variable. Since the correlation coefficient is based on the linear relationship between two variables, this will also increase the correlation coefficient.\n\n3. Interchanging the variables: This will reverse the direction of the linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nTo find the new correlation coefficient, we can use the formula for the correlation coefficient:\n\nr' = r * (1 - r^2)\n\nwhere r is the original correlation coefficient and r' is the new correlation coefficient.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nr' = 0.19 * (1 - 0.19^2) = 0.19 * (1 - 0.0361) = 0.19 * 0.969 = 0.184\n\nTherefore, the new correlation coefficient is 0.184, which is closest to option C. The correct answer is C."
