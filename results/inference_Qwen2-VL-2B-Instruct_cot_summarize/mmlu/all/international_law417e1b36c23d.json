The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State, even in the case that this conduct was unauthorized or ultra vires.\n\nThis option aligns with the principle that acts of State organs are considered acts of the State, regardless of whether they are authorized or not. It is important to note that the conduct of State organs is not limited to the executive branch alone, but encompasses all acts performed by any State organ, including those that are unauthorized or ultra vires."
