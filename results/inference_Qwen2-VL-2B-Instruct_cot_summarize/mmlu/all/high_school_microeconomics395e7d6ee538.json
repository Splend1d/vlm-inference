The total cost (TC) is equal to the sum of average variable cost (AVC) and average fixed cost (AFC) multiplied by the quantity (Q) of output.\n\nB. TFC = TC at all levels of output.\n- This is false. Total fixed cost (TFC) is not equal to total cost (TC) at all levels of output. Total cost increases as output increases, so TFC is not constant.\n\nC. AVC + AFC = TC.\n- This is false. Average variable cost (AVC) and average fixed cost (AFC) are not equal to total cost (TC). The sum of AVC and AFC is not equal to TC.\n\nD. MC = TC - TFC.\n- This is false. Marginal cost (MC) is not equal to total cost (TC) minus total fixed cost (TFC). Marginal cost is the change in total cost divided by the change in output, not the difference between total cost and total fixed cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
