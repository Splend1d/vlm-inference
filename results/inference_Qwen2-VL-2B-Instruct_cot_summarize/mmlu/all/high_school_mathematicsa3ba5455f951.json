This means that the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is equal to the first term times the $n-1^{\\text{th}}$ term. \n\nSince the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is given by $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$, we can write the $n-1^{\\text{th}}$ term as $a\\cdot r^{n-2}$. \n\nSo, we have $a\\cdot r^{n-1} = a\\cdot r^{n-2} \\cdot r$. \n\nSince $r > 1$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $r^{n-2}$ to get $a\\cdot r^{n-2} = a$. \n\nThis means that the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is equal to the first term. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $k$ is 1, because the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is equal to the first term for all $n$. \n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$."
