This increase in the money supply leads to an increase in the velocity of money, which is the number of times a dollar's worth of money can be spent before it is exhausted. If the velocity of money falls, it means that the money supply is being used more efficiently, and the potential amount of money created after the increase in bank reserves is diminished. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
