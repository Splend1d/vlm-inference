Marine birds excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands and excrete small volumes of urine.\n\nMarine birds maintain their tissue osmolarity at a constant level that is hypoosmotic to seawater by excreting salts through specialized salt-exchange glands. This process helps to maintain a balance between the body's water and salt content, which is crucial for their survival in the marine environment. The small volumes of urine produced by these glands help to maintain this osmotic balance. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the birds absorb water from the environment, which is not the case. Option B is incorrect because it suggests that the birds produce large volumes of concentrated urine, which is not the case. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the birds excrete salts through specialized nasal glands, which is not the case."
