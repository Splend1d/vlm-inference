                    "text": "The gravitational force between two objects is given by the formula:\n\nF = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects.\n\nIn this case, the mass of the Earth is 5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg, the mass of the Moon is 7.35 \u00d7 10^22 kg, and the distance between their centers is 3.84 \u00d7 10^8 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nF = G * (5.97 \u00d7 10^24 kg * 7.35 \u00d7 10^22 kg) / (3.84 \u00d7 10^8 m)^2\n\nF = 1.06 \u00d7 10^21 N\n\nTherefore, the best estimate of the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon is 10^21 N, which is approximately 10^29 N. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
