The bar was crowded because a championship boxing match was being shown on the television sets in the bar, and many people had gone to the bar to watch it. During the second round of the boxing match, someone bumped into the customer, causing him to spill a drink on his pants. \"Hey, watch what you're doing, jerk!\" the customer said. The person who had bumped the customer was an employee of the bar hired as a bouncer to deal with unruly customers. Angered by the customer's statement, the employee immediately turned around and punched the customer in the mouth.

This is because the customer asserts that the bar owner was reasonably foreseeable that fights would occur in a crowd of people who were drinking a lot of alcohol. This is a common legal defense for bar owners, as it suggests that the bar owner had a duty to ensure the safety of its patrons by preventing fights and other potentially dangerous situations. If the bar owner had not taken reasonable steps to prevent fights, the customer's claim could be upheld."
