At a pretrial hearing, the defendant told the judge that he was unhappy with the public defender who had been appointed to represent him and that he wanted the judge to appoint another lawyer. The judge refused to appoint another lawyer, telling the defendant, with no further explanation, that his only other choice was to represent himself. The defendant said that he would represent himself at trial then, as \"anything [was] better than having this lawyer.\" The defendant did not raise the subject again, and he represented himself at trial. After hearing overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, the jury convicted him of armed robbery. On appeal, the defendant has requested a new trial on the ground that he was deprived of his right to counsel. Should the appellate court grant the defendant's request?\n\nA. No, because the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel.\nB. No, because the trial court's error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was not capable of effectively representing himself.\nD. Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n"

This is a valid waiver if the defendant was aware of his rights and voluntarily chose to forego them. The defendant's statement that \"anything is better than this lawyer\" indicates that he was aware of his rights and chose to forego them voluntarily.\n\n2. **Harmlessness of the Error:**\n   - The error in the trial court's decision to appoint the defendant to represent himself rather than a public defender was harmless. The overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt was overwhelming, and the defendant's representation was not ineffective. The defendant's failure to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial was not a significant factor in the outcome of the trial.\n\nGiven that the defendant's waiver of counsel was valid and the error was harmless, the appellate court should not grant the defendant's request for a new trial.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nB. No, because the trial court's error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence."
