This approach argues that justice is not just about the distribution of resources, but also about the distribution of capabilities.\n\nThe 'capability' approach rejects Rawls' theory because it fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory of justice. Rawls' theory assumes that individuals have certain capabilities that are necessary for justice to be achieved, such as the ability to make rational decisions, to understand and apply the law, and to act in the best interests of others. However, the capability approach argues that individuals do not have these capabilities, and that justice can only be achieved if individuals are given the opportunity to develop these capabilities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
