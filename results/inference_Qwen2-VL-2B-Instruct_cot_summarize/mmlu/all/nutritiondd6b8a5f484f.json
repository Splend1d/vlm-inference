The rat protein efficiency ratio assay, (PER), is a good method of assessing protein quality for human nutrition.\n\nThe PER method is commonly used to evaluate the quality of dietary proteins in humans, as it takes into account the efficiency of protein utilization in the body. It is a more accurate and reliable method compared to other methods like the rat net protein-utilization assay (NPU) or animal growth assays, which may underestimate the quality of dietary proteins for human nutrition."
