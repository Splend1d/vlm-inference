In Scenario 1, washing the bed sheets with bleach is generally considered morally wrong because it can cause harm to the bed sheets and potentially harm the person using the bleach. In Scenario 2, testing out a laser pointer by aiming it at a helicopter is also generally considered morally wrong because it can cause harm to the helicopter and potentially harm the person using the laser pointer. Therefore, the main character's actions in both scenarios are morally wrong according the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
