There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.\nB. Whereas illegal markets were territorially bounded and isolated in the past, the contemporary form illicit markets tend to be interrelated and mutually supporting and more embedded in the legal economy.\nC. TNC is a response by the dispossessed in response to the asymmetric economic development of nation states and the inequity of global market capitalism married with environmental constraints on development.\nD. Transnational crime is no longer the exclusive domain of certain geographic areas or ethnic groups becoming globalized in operation, increasing the number of groups and countries affected and increasing the size of the illegal market ratio to licit trade.\n"

Transnational crime is no longer the exclusive domain of certain geographic areas or ethnic groups becoming globalized in operation, increasing the number of groups and countries affected and increasing the size of the illegal market ratio to licit trade.\n\nThis option accurately reflects the current state of transnational crime, which is not confined to specific geographic areas or ethnic groups but has become more globalized and interconnected, leading to increased numbers of affected groups and countries and a larger proportion of the illegal market compared to licit trade."
