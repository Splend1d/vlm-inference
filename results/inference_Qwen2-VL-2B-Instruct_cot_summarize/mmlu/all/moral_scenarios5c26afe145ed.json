This action can be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it can be perceived as disrespectful to others and can cause noise pollution.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character admired many of the paintings at the Louvre, which is generally considered a positive and respectful behavior. This action can be seen as morally right according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it shows appreciation for the artwork and can be seen as a form of cultural appreciation and education.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
