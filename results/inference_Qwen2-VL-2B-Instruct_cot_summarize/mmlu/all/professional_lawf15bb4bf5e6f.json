The authorities arrested the man for felonious larceny, a crime that is also called theft in some states. The man defended on the basis that he had no intent to steal and only wanted his rightful compensation. He filed a motion to dismiss, relying essentially on proof that he had no intent to steal because he believed in good faith that it was his own property. What will be the most likely decision of the court?\n\nA. The charges will not be dismissed because his intent becomes irrelevant when he uses force to obtain possession of property.\nB. The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\nC. The charges will be dismissed because he can raise the defense of necessity and it is always lawful to take what a person needs to survive.\nD. The charges will not be dismissed because the man's right to the money was disputed and therefore his intent is irrelevant as compared to the employer's intent and belief.\n"

The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\n\nThis reasoning is based on the fact that the man's defense relies on the belief that he had a right to the money, which is a defense that is not relevant to the elements of theft and larceny. The court will likely find that the man's belief that he had a right to the money is not a valid defense to the charges of theft and larceny, as these crimes require an intent to steal."
