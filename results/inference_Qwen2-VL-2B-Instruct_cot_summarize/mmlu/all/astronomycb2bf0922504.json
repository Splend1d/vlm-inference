Once a hypothesis has been tested and proven correct by a large number of people, it is considered to be a well-established scientific theory. This is because the scientific method requires that the results of experiments be reproducible and repeatable, and that the results are consistent across different experiments. Once a hypothesis has been proven correct by a large number of people, it is considered to be a well-established scientific theory."
