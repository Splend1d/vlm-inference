The type of paint is the independent variable, and the sex of the children is the blocking factor.\n\nC. **Sex is a blocking factor.**\n   - This statement is false because the experiment does not involve any blocking factor. The type of paint is the independent variable, and the sex of the children is the blocking factor.\n\nD. **This is a completely randomized design.**\n   - This statement is false because the experiment does not meet the criteria for a completely randomized design. A completely randomized design would involve random assignment of subjects to treatments without any blocking factors, but in this case, there are both the type of paint and the sex of the children as blocking factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nA. There are three types of paint and two sex groups, giving a total of six treatment combinations in this experiment."
