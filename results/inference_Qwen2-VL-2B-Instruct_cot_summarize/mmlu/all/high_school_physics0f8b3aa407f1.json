In this case, the image appears 2 cm behind the mirror, so the focal length of the mirror is the distance from the mirror to the point where the image appears.\n\nThe focal length of a diverging mirror is given by the formula:\n\nf = 1/v + 1/v'\n\nwhere f is the focal length and v is the distance from the mirror to the point where the image appears.\n\nIn this case, the distance from the mirror to the point where the image appears is 10 cm (the object distance). So we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\nf = 1/10 + 1/v'\n\nWe can solve for v by rearranging the formula:\n\nv = 1/f - 1/10\n\nNow we can substitute the values of f and v into the formula:\n\nv = 1/(-5/3) - 1/10\n\nv = -3/5 - 1/10\n\nv = -3/5 - 1/10\n\nv = -6/10 - 1/10\n\nv = -7/10\n\nSo the focal length of the mirror is -7/10 cm. However, this is not an option in the choices provided. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options."
