Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter occurs when a person intentionally causes death to another person, but the death is caused by an unforeseen and unintentional event. In this case, the defendant accidentally nicked the neighbor's arm with the knife, which was not intended to cause harm. The neighbor's death was caused by an unforeseen and unintentional event, which is why the defendant cannot be convicted of murder. Voluntary manslaughter is a lesser charge that occurs when a person intentionally causes death to another person, but the death is caused by an unforeseen and unintentional event. Battery is a lesser charge that occurs when a person intentionally causes harm to another person, but the harm is not intentional."
