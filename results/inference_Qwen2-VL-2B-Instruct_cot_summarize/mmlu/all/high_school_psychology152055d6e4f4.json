While experimenting with rats, Pavlov discovered that if he repeatedly placed pellets of food in one side of a \"T-maze,\" the rats would automatically run to that side of the maze.\nB. While experimenting with dogs, Pavlov discovered that once his dogs became accustomed to seeing and hearing the attendant who brought them food at mealtime, they would salivate in response to the sight and sound of the attendant.\nC. While experimenting with cats, Pavlov discovered that if he placed a hungry cat inside a box and food outside the box, the cat could \"learn\" to press a lever to open the door of the box.\nD. While experimenting with pigeons, Pavlov discovered that if he placed a pigeon in a box, he could condition it to recognize that if it pecked at a particular key, it would receive a food pellet.\n"

Pavlov was experimenting with rats and noticed that if he repeatedly placed pellets of food in one side of a maze, the rats would naturally run to that side. This was an accidental discovery, as Pavlov did not intend to observe the rats' behavior in this way."
