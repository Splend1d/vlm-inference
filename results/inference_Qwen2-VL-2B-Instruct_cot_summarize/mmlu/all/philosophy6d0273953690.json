However, the statement implies that the definition of reason itself is derived from myth, not that mythos is based on logos.\n\nB. **Myth does not \"explain\" how things are related as much as it simply reveals them as related.**\n   - This option suggests that myth does not provide explanations but rather reveals relationships. However, the statement implies that myth defines reason itself, not that it explains relationships.\n\nC. **Metaphysicians are justified in reasoning as they do because there is only one true answer about being.**\n   - This option suggests that metaphysicians justify their reasoning because there is only one true answer about being. However, the statement does not discuss metaphysicians or their justification for reasoning.\n\nD. **Myth and reason are the same: \"myth\" defines \"reason,\" and \"reason\" defines \"myth.\"**\n   - This option suggests that myth and reason are the same, with myth defining reason and reason defining myth. However, the statement implies that myth defines reason itself, not that they are the same.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the statement implies that myth defines reason itself, not that they are the same. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Myth and reason are the same: \"myth\" defines \"reason,\" and \"reason\" defines \"myth.\"**"
