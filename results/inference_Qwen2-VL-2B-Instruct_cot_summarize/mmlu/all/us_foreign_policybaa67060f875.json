An American proclamation that China should be open to US trade and missionaries.\n\nThe \"open-door notes\" were a series of diplomatic communications issued by the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that outlined the country's policy towards China. These notes were aimed at promoting American trade and missionary activities in China, and they were a key part of the US's efforts to gain influence and control over the country."
