The judge's decision to not appoint a lawyer was based on the fact that Defendant will not go to jail for more than six months if convicted. This is a legal principle known as the indigency doctrine, which allows indigent defendants to proceed without an appointed lawyer if they will not be sentenced to jail for a significant period of time."
