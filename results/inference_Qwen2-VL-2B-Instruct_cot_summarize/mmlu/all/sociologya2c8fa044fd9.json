Selective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils, while the comprehensives put children into ability streams.\n\nIn the 1960s, comprehensive schools were introduced as a response to the perceived inequalities in education caused by selective schools. These schools aimed to provide a more equal education for all students, regardless of their background. However, the introduction of comprehensive schools did not completely eliminate class inequalities because selective schools still existed and continued to 'cream off' the most able pupils. This meant that some students were still being excluded from the most prestigious schools, while others were being given access to a more diverse and inclusive education."
