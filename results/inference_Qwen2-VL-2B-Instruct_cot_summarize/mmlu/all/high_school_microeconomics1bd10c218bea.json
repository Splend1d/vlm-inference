The marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost.\n\nA negative externality occurs when the marginal social benefit (MSB) of a good is less than its marginal social cost (MSC). When the MSB is less than the MSC, the production of the good leads to a net loss of resources and social welfare. This is because the production of the good results in a net loss of resources, which is not compensated by the benefits it brings to society."
