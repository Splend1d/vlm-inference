As prices increase, consumers are willing to buy more of the good, and as prices decrease, consumers are willing to buy less of the good. This is because automobiles are a status symbol and a status symbol is highly sensitive to price changes. Therefore, the demand for automobiles is likely to have the most elastic demand curve."
