There is a programming error in the software which causes the system to perform badly.\nC. All of these options.\nD.

The IT system has failed due to a random unexpected event, such as a tsunami which destroys key electronic equipment.\n\nIn this context, \"failure\" refers to a situation where the IT system is unable to perform its intended functions due to an external event that is beyond the control of the system's operators. In this case, the IT system has failed because of a natural disaster (tsunami), which is an external event that cannot be controlled by the system's operators. Therefore, it fits the definition of a \"failure\" as per the given classification."
