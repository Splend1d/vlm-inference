If the array is initially sorted in descending order, then insertion sort will be more efficient than selection sort.\n- This statement is incorrect. Insertion sort is not more efficient than selection sort when the array is initially sorted in descending order. In fact, insertion sort is generally more efficient for such cases.\n\nB. The number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.\n- This statement is incorrect. The number of comparisons for selection sort is not independent of the initial arrangement of elements. The number of comparisons is directly proportional to the number of elements in the array, and the initial arrangement of elements does affect the number of comparisons needed.\n\nC. The number of comparisons for insertion sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.\n- This statement is incorrect. The number of comparisons for insertion sort is not independent of the initial arrangement of elements. The number of comparisons is directly proportional to the number of elements in the array, and the initial arrangement of elements does affect the number of comparisons needed.\n\nD. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.\n- This statement is correct. Selection sort involves moving elements from their original positions to their final sorted positions. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is:\n\nD. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements."
