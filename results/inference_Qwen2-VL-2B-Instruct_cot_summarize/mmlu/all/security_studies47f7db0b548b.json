Defensive realism regards cooperation as the way in which states can achieve security.\n\nDefensive realism is a theory in international relations that emphasizes the importance of states' ability to defend themselves against threats and maintain their security. It does not necessarily advocate for cooperation as a means to achieve security. Instead, it focuses on the need for states to have the resources and capabilities to protect themselves from external threats. Therefore, option B is not correct."
