Slashing someone's tires is a violent and aggressive act that violates property rights and can cause significant harm to the tires and potentially to the tires' owner. This action is not only illegal but also morally reprehensible.\n\nScenario 2: I convinced my wife we should sell our car. This action is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Selling a car is a private decision and does not involve any harm to others or violation of any legal or moral standards. It is a matter of personal choice and does not involve any wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
