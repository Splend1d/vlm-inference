The normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, and the standard deviation is the same for all values within a normal distribution.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (\u03bc) = 75,000 miles\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = 12,000 miles\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score for the value of 100,000 miles. The z-score is calculated as:\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value we are interested in, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{100,000 - 75,000}{12,000} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{25,000}{12,000} \\]\n\\[ z = 2.17 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles. This is equivalent to finding the area under the normal curve to the left of z = 2.17.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find:\n\\[ P(Z < 2.17) \\approx 0.94 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles, is approximately 0.94, which corresponds to option D."
