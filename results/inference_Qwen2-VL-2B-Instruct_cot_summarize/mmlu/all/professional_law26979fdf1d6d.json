The defendant purchased a ski mask and then went into the liquor store, put his gun into the face of the clerk, and demanded the money from the register. Terrified, the clerk gave him the money from the register. The defendant pocketed the money, grabbed a bottle of tequila off the shelf for his celebration, and then ran back to the car and drove off. About an hour later, the defendant was slowly approaching his hideout in the outskirts of town when a young child suddenly darted in front of the defendant's car. He applied the brakes but couldn't stop in time. The car struck the child, killing her. For the child's death, the defendant should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Felony murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

The person may have acted in a reckless manner, but the death was not intended. In this case, the defendant's actions were not intentional, and the death was not intended. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of voluntary manslaughter.\n\n2. **Felony murder**: This is a more serious charge, where the defendant intentionally causes death. The defendant's actions were intentional, and the death was intended. In this case, the defendant's actions were not intentional, and the death was not intended. Therefore, the defendant should not be found guilty of felony murder.\n\nGiven the defendant's actions, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Voluntary manslaughter.**"
