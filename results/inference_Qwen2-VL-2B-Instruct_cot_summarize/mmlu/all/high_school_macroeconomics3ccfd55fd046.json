Frictional unemployment.\n\nFrictional unemployment occurs when workers are temporarily out of a job due to a mismatch between their skills and the skills required for available jobs. This type of unemployment is not caused by a lack of demand for labor or a general economic downturn, but rather by the mismatch between supply and demand for labor. As long as there is a lack of matching between workers and jobs, frictional unemployment will exist and will not be eliminated by economic policies or corporate actions."
