Large magnitude reinforcement\n\nLarge magnitude reinforcement, also known as punishment, is a training method that involves delivering a strong negative stimulus (punishment) after a response is made. This can be in the form of a shock, a loud noise, or any other strong negative stimulus. Large magnitude reinforcement is effective in developing 2 response most resistant to extinction because it creates a strong negative association between the response and the outcome, making it more difficult for the response to be extinguished."
