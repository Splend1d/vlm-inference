                    "text": "The total energy released in the impact of a comet on the Earth can be calculated using the conservation of energy principle. The total energy before the impact is the sum of the kinetic energy of the comet and the potential energy of the comet's orbit around the Earth. The total energy after the impact is the sum of the kinetic energy of the comet and the potential energy of the comet's orbit around the Earth after the impact.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the comet is given by:\n\nK = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere v is the speed of the comet.\n\nThe potential energy of the comet's orbit around the Earth is given by:\n\nU = -G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and R is the radius of the Earth.\n\nThe total energy before the impact is:\n\nE_total_before = K + U\n\nThe total energy after the impact is:\n\nE_total_after = K + U'\n\nwhere U' is the potential energy of the comet's orbit around the Earth after the impact.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for K and U into the equation for E_total_before, we get:\n\nE_total_before = 0.5 * m * v^2 - G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R))\n\nSubstituting the expression for U' into the equation for E_total_after, we get:\n\nE_total_after = 0.5 * m * v^2 + G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R))\n\nSubtracting the two equations, we get:\n\nE_total_after - E_total_before = 0.5 * m * v^2 + G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R)) - (0.5 * m * v^2 - G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R)))\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nE_total_after - E_total_before = G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R))\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the impact is:\n\nE_total = E_total_after - E_total_before = G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R))\n\nSubstituting the expression for E_total into the expression for U', we get:\n\nE_total = G * M * (R^2 / (2 * R)) = 0.5 * m * (2 * G / R)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.5*m*(2*GM/R)"
