Always downward sloping.\n\nIn the long run, the AS curve is always downward sloping because it represents the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied by producers. As the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is known as the law of supply, which states that the quantity supplied of a good or service is inversely proportional to its price. Therefore, the AS curve is always downward sloping in the long run."
