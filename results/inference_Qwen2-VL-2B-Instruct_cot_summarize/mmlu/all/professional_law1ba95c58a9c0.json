The man called a towing company and told the company's manager that the car was 100 feet down the embankment. \"That's lucky,\" said the manager, \"because our winch only goes 100 feet.\" After the manager and the man agreed on a price, an employee of the company attempted to reach the car but could not because the car turned out to be 120 feet down the embankment. Is the towing company's performance excused on the grounds of mistake?\n\nA. No, because both parties were uncertain about the distance.\nB. No, because the towing company assumed the risk by the manager's failure to examine the distance himself.\nC. Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\nD. Yes, because the agreement did not allocate the risk of mistake to either party.\n"

The company's manager informed the man that the winch could only go 100 feet down the embankment. The manager and the man agreed on a price.\n\n2. **Misunderstanding**: The man initially thought the car was 100 feet down the embankment. However, the car turned out to be 120 feet down the embankment.\n\n3. **Legal Considerations**: The key here is whether the company's performance is excused based on the man's misunderstanding.\n\n- **Option A: No, because both parties were uncertain about the distance.**\n  - This option suggests that the uncertainty was mutual and not solely the man's. However, the man's misunderstanding was the primary issue, and the company's performance is not excused solely because both parties were uncertain.\n\n- **Option B: No, because the towing company assumed the risk by the manager's failure to examine the distance himself.**\n  - This option implies that the company assumed the risk by the manager's failure to check the distance himself. However, the man's misunderstanding was the primary issue, and the company's performance is not excused solely because the manager assumed the risk.\n\n- **Option C: Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.**\n  - This option suggests that the misunderstanding was a fundamental assumption on which the contract was based. If the misunderstanding was a fundamental assumption, the company's performance would be excused.\n\n- **Option D: Yes, because the agreement did not allocate the risk of mistake to either party.**\n  - This option implies that the agreement did not allocate the risk of mistake to either party. However, the man's misunderstanding was the primary issue, and the company's performance is not excused solely because the agreement did not allocate the risk.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.**\n\nThis option aligns with the scenario where the misunderstanding was a fundamental assumption on which the contract was based, making the company's performance excused."
