No, this was not robbery because there was no intimidation, and indeed no force, against an unconscious victim.\n\nRobbery is defined as the unlawful taking of property from another's person by intimidation or force. In this scenario, the man did not use force or intimidation against the unconscious female guest. Instead, he quietly took her purse, emptied all of the money into his pockets, and removed the jewelry from her person. This behavior does not meet the criteria for robbery because there was no force or intimidation used against the victim."
