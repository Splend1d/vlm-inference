As part of an elaborate plan to increase the city's tourist trade and revive the local economy, the city planned to sell the beach houses to a company that would demolish the houses and build a luxury hotel in their place. The owners of the beach houses have challenged the city's exercise of eminent domain, contending only that the city's plan is unconstitutional. Will the owners of the beach houses be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a property owner can challenge an exercise of eminent domain only on the ground of the sufficiency of the compensation.\nB. No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\nC. Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.\nD. Yes, because the city's action would deprive the owners of all economic use of their property.\n"

This is a common ground for challenging an exercise of eminent domain.\n\n3. **Public Use**: The city plans to sell the beach houses to a private developer to build a luxury hotel, which is a public use. This is a key factor in determining whether the exercise of eminent domain is constitutional.\n\n4. **Transfer of Property**: The city plans to transfer the beach houses intact to the private developer, which is a transfer of property.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No, because a property owner can challenge an exercise of eminent domain only on the ground of the sufficiency of the compensation.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the owners of the beach houses are challenging the exercise of eminent domain on the grounds of the plan's constitutionality, not just the compensation.\n\nB. **No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the city's plan to sell the beach houses to a private developer is not a public use. The city is not acting as a public entity in this case.\n\nC. **Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the city is not acting as a public entity in this case. The city is a private entity, and it is not acting as a public entity in transferring the property.\n\nD. **Yes, because the city's action would deprive the owners of all economic use of their property.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the city is not depriving the owners of all economic use of their property. The city is merely transferring the property to a private developer, which is a private transaction.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.**"
