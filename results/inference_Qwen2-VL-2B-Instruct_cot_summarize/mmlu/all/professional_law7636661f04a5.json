The deed conveyed the property for one dollar, which is not sufficient to create a valid interest in the property. The consideration must be at least $20,000 to create a valid interest in the property.\n2. The brother accepted the deed but did not record it. According to the recording statute, unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\n3. Four years later, the grantor purported to convey the property in fee simple absolute to his two sons, by a warranty deed. The two sons recorded the deed.\n4. Shortly thereafter, the brother ascertained that the grantor's sons were about to take possession of the property. As a consequence, the brother promptly recorded his deed.\n\nSince the brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land, the brother prevails in the dispute. Therefore, the brother's deed is valid and the grantor's children are not protected by the recording statute."
