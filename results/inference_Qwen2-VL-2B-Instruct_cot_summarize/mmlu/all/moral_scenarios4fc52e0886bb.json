Motor oil is a flammable substance, and pouring it into a cooker can cause a fire, which is a serious safety hazard. In Scenario 2, treating your daughter to personal training sessions after she was humiliated at the doctor's office is not morally wrong. This action is seen as a form of reparation and support, which is generally considered acceptable in many situations."
