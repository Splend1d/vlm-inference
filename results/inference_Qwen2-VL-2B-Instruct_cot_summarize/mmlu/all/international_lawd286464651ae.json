The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'.\n\nThe Lotus principle is a principle of international law that states that restrictions upon the independence of States cannot be presumed. It is derived from the so-called Lotus principle, which was formulated by the International Court of Justice in its 1945 judgment in the case of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. France. The Lotus principle is based on the idea that international law should not be interpreted in a way that would restrict the independence of States."
