At sentencing the court made additional factual findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. Does counsel have a valid constitutional argument?\n\nA. No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.\n"

Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Constitution does not explicitly grant a defendant the right to a jury trial on issues of fact that result in a sentence that is greater than the maximum sentence recommended by the jury. However, the Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment's right to a jury trial does not extend to issues of fact that result in a sentence that is greater than the maximum sentence recommended by the jury. This is because the jury's verdict is the ultimate determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence, and the court's role is to impose a sentence that is consistent with the jury's verdict. Therefore, the court's ability to impose a sentence that is greater than the jury's verdict is not a violation of the defendant's right to a jury trial.\n\nIn this case, the court made additional factual findings based on a preponderance of the evidence that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. This is a valid constitutional argument because the court's ability to impose a sentence that is greater than the jury's verdict is not a violation of the defendant's right to a jury trial."
