This is a significant statistic, but it does not necessarily show that the survey is meaningless or that it would have been more meaningful if he had picked a random sample or used a control group. \n\nThe key point here is that the survey's results are based on a specific subset of e-mail messages, which may not be representative of the broader audience. Therefore, the survey's results should be interpreted with caution and not taken as a definitive conclusion about the broader population.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. No meaningful conclusion is possible without knowing something more about the characteristics of his listeners."
