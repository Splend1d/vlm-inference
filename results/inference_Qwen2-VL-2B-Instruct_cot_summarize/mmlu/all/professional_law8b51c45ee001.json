When he was refused admittance, the man angrily shouted to the club's doorman, \"You'll be sorry for this. After I'm through, this club will be reduced to rubble. \" Later that same evening, the man returned to the club with two explosives in his possession. He noticed the defendant leaving the club and followed him into a nearby parking lot. As the defendant was about to enter his car, the man grabbed him, pointed a gun and said, \"Follow me, you punk, or I'll blow your brains out. \" The man led the defendant to the rear of the club, handed him the explosives, and directed him to throw them through an open window of the club. In fear of his life, the defendant tossed the explosives into the club, causing an inferno that killed 25 people. In this jurisdiction, the applicable arson statute includes all buildings. If the defendant is charged with felony murder for the death of the people in the club, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.\nB. guilty, because duress is not a defense to murder.\nC. not guilty, because duress is a defense to arson.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant was justified under the circumstances.\n"

The statute of arson includes all buildings, which means that the defendant's actions were not only committing arson but also engaging in murder. The statute of murder includes the killing of people, and since the defendant killed 25 people, he is charged with murder. Therefore, the defendant is most likely found guilty of murder, even though he was also committing arson."
