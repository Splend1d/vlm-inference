Genetic changes can only occur at the population level.\n\nExplanation: Populations are the fundamental unit of evolution because they are the units of genetic variation and the source of genetic change. Genetic changes, such as mutations and genetic drift, occur at the population level, and these changes can lead to evolutionary change over time. Individuals within a population do not evolve independently; they are influenced by the genetic changes that occur within the population as a whole."
