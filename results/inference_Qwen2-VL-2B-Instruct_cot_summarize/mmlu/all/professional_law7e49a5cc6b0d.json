The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress. She has sued the hospital. Is the hospital likely to be held liable to the widow?\n\nA. No, because the widow did not witness the cremation.\nB. No, because the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm.\nC. Yes, because hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses.\nD.

This negligence led to serious emotional distress for the widow.\n\n2. **Legal Framework**: In many jurisdictions, hospitals are held liable for the negligence of their employees, including medical staff, who handle patients' bodies. This liability is often based on the principle of strict liability, which holds hospitals responsible for any foreseeable harm caused by their employees' negligence.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the widow did not witness the cremation, which is irrelevant to the hospital's liability. The hospital's negligence is not based on whether the widow witnessed the cremation.\n   - **Option B**: This option states that the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm. However, the hospital's negligence led to serious emotional distress, which is a form of bodily harm.\n   - **Option C**: This option states that hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses. While this is a general principle, it does not directly address the specific case of the hospital's negligence leading to emotional distress.\n   - **Option D**: This option suggests that the hospital's negligence was especially likely to cause serious emotional distress. This is a reasonable interpretation of the situation, as the hospital's negligence directly caused emotional distress to the widow.\n\nGiven the context and the legal principles, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress.**\n\nThis option aligns with the principle of strict liability, which holds hospitals responsible for any foreseeable harm caused by their employees' negligence."
