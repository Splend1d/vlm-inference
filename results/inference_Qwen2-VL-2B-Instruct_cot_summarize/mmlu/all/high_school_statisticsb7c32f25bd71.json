                    "text": "To find the mean longevity when 30% of the people live longer than 75 years, we can use the properties of a normal distribution. The mean of a normal distribution is the average of the distribution, and the standard deviation is the spread of the distribution.\n\nGiven:\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = 14 years\n- Percentage of people living longer than 75 years = 30%\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of people living longer than 75 years. Since 30% of the people live longer than 75 years, we calculate this as:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 100 = 30 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the mean longevity for the group of people living longer than 75 years. The mean (\u03bc) of a normal distribution is the average of the distribution, and it can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{\\text{mean of the distribution}}{1 - \\frac{\\text{percentage of people living longer than 75 years}}{100}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{75}{1 - \\frac{30}{100}} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{75}{0.7} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 107.14 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the mean longevity for the entire population. Since the distribution is normal, we can use the z-score to find the mean. The z-score is calculated as:\n\\[ z = \\frac{\\text{mean of the distribution} - \\text{mean of the group living longer than 75 years}}{\\text{standard deviation}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ z = \\frac{107.14 - 75}{14} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{32.14}{14} \\]\n\\[ z = 2.34 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability of a z-score of 2.34 or higher. This probability is approximately 0.004756.\n\nFinally, we calculate the mean longevity for the entire population:\n\\[ \\text{Mean longevity for the entire population} = \\mu + z \\times \\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\text{Mean longevity for the entire population} = 107.14 + 2.34 \\times 14 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Mean longevity for the entire population} = 107.14 + 32.16 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Mean longevity for the entire population} = 139.3 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 75 - 0.4756(14)"
