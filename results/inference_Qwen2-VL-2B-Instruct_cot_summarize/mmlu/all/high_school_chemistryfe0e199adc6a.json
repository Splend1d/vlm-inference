The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n"

The sample temperature change is greater than the water temperature change.\n\nB. **Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.**\n   - This is incorrect because the sample temperature increased from 100 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C, while the water temperature increased from 26 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C. The sample temperature change is greater than the water temperature change.\n\nC. **The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.**\n   - This is incorrect because the sample temperature change is greater than the water temperature change, but the heat capacity of the sample and the water are not directly compared in this context.\n\nD. **The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.**\n   - This is incorrect because the final temperature is 37 \u00b0C, which is higher than the initial temperature of the water (26 \u00b0C), indicating that the system is not in equilibrium.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**B. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.**"
