The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nWhen the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, it indicates that there is an increase in aggregate demand, which leads to an increase in the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output. This is because an increase in aggregate demand means that there is more spending available to purchase goods and services, which drives up prices and increases output."
