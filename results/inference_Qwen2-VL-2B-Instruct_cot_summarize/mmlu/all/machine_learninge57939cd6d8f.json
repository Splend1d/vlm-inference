The use of classification algorithms which are not prone to overfitting\n\nBagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is a technique used to prevent overfitting by combining multiple predictions from different subsets of the data. It involves training multiple classifiers on different subsets of the data and then averaging their predictions. This reduces the risk of overfitting because the different subsets are likely to capture different patterns in the data."
