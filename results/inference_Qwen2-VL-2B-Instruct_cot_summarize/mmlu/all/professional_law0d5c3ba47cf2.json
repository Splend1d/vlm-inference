The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?\n\nA. No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.\nB. No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.\nC. Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.\nD. Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n"

This is a legal transfer of ownership, not a disguised mortgage.\n\n2. **Doctrine of Equitable Redemption**: The doctrine of equitable redemption allows a party to acquire title to property by giving up their right to foreclose on it. This doctrine is not applicable here because the builder is not the original owner of the property.\n\n3. **Reasonable and Fair Transaction**: The transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances. The builder bought the house for a price that was fair and reasonable, and the buyer agreed to the terms of the sale.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances."
