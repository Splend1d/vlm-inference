Principle actors are social constructs that are made through political practices.\nB. Natural-science methodology is the best way to study social science, interpretive methodologies lack the coherence required for in-depth analysis.\nC. Knowledge of the social world is not objective, as there is no divide between the social world and knowledge of that world.\nD.
