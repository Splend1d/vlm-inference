When he confronted her with it she laughed derisively, admitted to the adultery in sordid detail, and taunted him with insults. He got into a rage and killed her on the spot. In the trial for first degree murder, defense counsel asked for a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter. The trial judge refused. On appeal will the husband prevail on an argument that the facts justified a charge of voluntary manslaughter?\n\nA. No, voluntary manslaughter is only available when the adultery is witnessed in real time by the defendant.\nB. No, mere words are never a sufficient provocation to establish voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Yes, an admission of adultery always justifies a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\nD.

Voluntary manslaughter is a legal doctrine that allows for the death of a person who was killed as a result of a provocation that was not intended to cause death. In other words, the provocation must be sufficient to cause death, but not necessarily to cause serious injury.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. No, voluntary manslaughter is only available when the adultery is witnessed in real time by the defendant.\n- This statement is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter can be applied even if the adultery was not witnessed in real time.\n\nB. No, mere words are never a sufficient provocation to establish voluntary manslaughter.\n- This statement is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter can be applied even if the provocation was mere words.\n\nC. Yes, an admission of adultery always justifies a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n- This statement is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter can be applied even if the adultery was not admitted.\n\nD. Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n- This statement is correct. The husband's provocation was sufficient to cause the death of his wife, even though it was not intended to cause serious injury.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
