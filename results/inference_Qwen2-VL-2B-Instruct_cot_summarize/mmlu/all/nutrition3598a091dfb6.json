Sudden weaning from the breast.\n\nOedema (swelling) is a symptom of kwashiorkor, a severe form of malnutrition that occurs when a person's body cannot absorb and use the nutrients they need. The symptoms of kwashiorkor include swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, as well as other signs of malnutrition such as loss of muscle mass and skin changes.\n\nThe other options listed (altered composition of intestinal bacteria, low intake of antioxidant nutrients, and iron deficiency) are not typically considered causes of kwashiorkor. However, they can contribute to the symptoms of malnutrition and can be associated with kwashiorkor in some cases."
