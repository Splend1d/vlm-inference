Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n"

Specifically, the prosecutor is seeking to establish that the witness's failure to mention the alibi statement when asked about the defendant's statements is not due to a lack of memory or confusion, but rather due to a deliberate attempt to avoid implicating the defendant in the crime. This is a form of impeachment, which is allowed under the rules of cross-examination in criminal trials. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency."
