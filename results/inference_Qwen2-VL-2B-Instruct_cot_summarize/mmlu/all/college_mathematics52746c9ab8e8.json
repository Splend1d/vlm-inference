We can use the chain rule to find this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt} \\]\n\nGiven that the rate of change of the height of the water is 3 cm^3 per minute, we can find the rate of change of the height of the water with respect to time t:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{\u03c0}{3} \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{\u03c0}{3} \\cdot 3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \u03c0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the rate of change of the height of the water with respect to time t is \u03c0 cm/min.
