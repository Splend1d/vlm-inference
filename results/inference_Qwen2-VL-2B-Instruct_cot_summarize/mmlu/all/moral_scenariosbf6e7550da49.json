According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, laughing at someone who is under the age of consent is generally considered morally wrong. Therefore, the main character's action is morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character took their phone out after the movie started to record it. This action is generally considered morally wrong as well. Recording someone without their consent is considered a violation of privacy and can be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. Therefore, the main character's action is also morally wrong.\n\nBoth scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
