Since there are four females and four males, we can use combinations to find the number of ways to assign these roles. The number of ways to choose one role for each lead is \\(C(4,1) \\times C(4,1)\\), where \\(C(n, k)\\) is the number of combinations of \\(n\\) items taken \\(k\\) at a time.\n\n\\[C(4,1) = 4\\]\n\\[C(4,1) = 4\\]\n\nSo, the total number of ways to assign the roles is:\n\n\\[4 \\times 4 = 16\\]\n\nNext, we need to assign the three different objects to the three different genders. Since there are three genders and three different objects, we can use permutations to find the number of ways to assign these objects. The number of ways to assign one object to one gender is \\(P(3,1)\\), and since there are three genders, the total number of ways to assign the objects is:\n\n\\[P(3,1) \\times P(3,1) \\times P(3,1)\\]\n\n\\[P(3,1) = 3!\\]\n\\[P(3,1) = 3!\\]\n\\[P(3,1) = 6\\]\n\nSo, the total number of ways to assign the objects is:\n\n\\[6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 6^3 = 216\\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to assign the roles by the number of ways to assign the objects to get the total number of ways to assign the roles and the objects:\n\n\\[16 \\times 216 = 3216\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1920"
