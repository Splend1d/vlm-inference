For 15 years, a commercial fisherman had kept a daily log of the water level at his dock on the riverbank opposite the land in order to forecast fishing conditions. The plaintiff hired a draftsman to graph the data from the fisherman's logs for use as a trial exhibit. At trial, the fisherman testified to the care with which he had made the measurements and recorded them in his logs, which had been made available for the defendant's inspection. The draftsman then testified to the manner in which he had prepared the graphs. With this foundation, are the graphs admissible?\n\nA. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule.\nC. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\nD. Yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels.\n"

The draftsman's testimony about the care with which he made the measurements and recorded them in his logs is not hearsay because it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. It is not a statement by the party opposing the motion to show cause that he is or is not the owner of the land.\n\n2. **Best Evidence Rule**: The best evidence rule requires that the evidence be presented in the form of a witness' testimony. The draftsman's testimony about the manner in which he prepared the graphs is not the best evidence because it is not a witness' testimony. It is a lay opinion about the graphs.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.**"
