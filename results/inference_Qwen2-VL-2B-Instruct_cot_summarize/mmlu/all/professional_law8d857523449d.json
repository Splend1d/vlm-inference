In accordance with the bylaws of the league's charter, the commissioner was required to obtain the approval of at least half the owners before raising his expense allocation. At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation. The commissioner's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.\nB. admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the league's charter is the best evidence.\n"

This is not a statement of intent or authority, but rather a recollection of a past practice.\n\n2. **Hearsay Rule**: In legal terms, hearsay evidence is not admissible unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions. The hearsay rule generally prohibits the admission of statements made out of court, unless they are admitted as a matter of law or are admissible under an exception.\n\n3. **Recognition of Exceptions**: The commissioner's testimony is not recognized as an exception to the hearsay rule. The only exception recognized for hearsay evidence is when it is admitted as a matter of law, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the commissioner's testimony is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements of the hearsay rule.\n\n**Final Answer: C. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.**"
