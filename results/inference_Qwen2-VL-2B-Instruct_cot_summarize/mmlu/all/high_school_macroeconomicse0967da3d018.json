This exchange is represented by the flow from households to firms, which is the direct transfer of goods and services from households to firms. The other options involve indirect exchanges, such as households providing goods to firms in exchange for wage payments, households providing resources to firms in exchange for goods, or households providing revenues to firms in exchange for wage payments."
