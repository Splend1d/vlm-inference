This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves using a substitute material that is not intended for the purpose it is being used for.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character planted a flower on Bill to see if sparks would fly. This action is not explicitly stated as morally wrong, but it is considered unethical because it involves a form of manipulation or deception. While it is not explicitly stated as morally wrong, it is generally considered unethical and potentially harmful to Bill's feelings or well-being."
