Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the president\u00d5s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the legal implications of the president's actions and the consequences of those actions. The president's actions were to deliver a defective lot of the firm's anticancer prescription medication, which was found to be below strength. The patient who received the defective pills died shortly after beginning to take them, and medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength. The president was convicted of murder.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Strict Criminal Liability**: The president's actions were not only illegal but also resulted in a death. This suggests that the president's actions were intentional and could be considered murder.\n\n2. **Regulatory Offenses**: The president's actions were not just a regulatory offense but also a criminal one. The defective lot of medication was not just a violation of the firm's quality control procedures but also a violation of public health and safety laws.\n\n3. **Proximate Cause**: The death of the patient was not solely due to the defective medication. The patient would have died regardless of the medication's strength. The death was caused by the defective medication, but the president's actions were the proximate cause of death.\n\nGiven these points, the president's actions were not only illegal but also resulted in a death. The death was not solely due to the defective medication but was caused by the president's actions. Therefore, the conviction should not be reversed.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient."
