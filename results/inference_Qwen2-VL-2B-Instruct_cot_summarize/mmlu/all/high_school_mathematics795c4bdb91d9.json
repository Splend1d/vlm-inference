Therefore, the number of days from January 1st to the day when the entire town is infected can be represented as \\(d + 3d + 3d + \\ldots + 3d\\), where \\(d\\) days are added every 3 days.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\(a = 3d\\) and the common difference \\(d = 3\\). The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\nIn this case, \\(n = d + 3d + 3d + \\ldots + 3d\\), and \\(l = 3d\\).
