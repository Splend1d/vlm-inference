The rule against perpetuities.\n\nThe rule against perpetuities is a common law doctrine that prevents a conveyance from creating a life estate to a person who is not the owner of the property. In this case, the deed to Friend is not effective because it creates a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to Owner. The rule against perpetuities prevents this type of conveyance from occurring, ensuring that the property remains in the ownership of the original owner.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
