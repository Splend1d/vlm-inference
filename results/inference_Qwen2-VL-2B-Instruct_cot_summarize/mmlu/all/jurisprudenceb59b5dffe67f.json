That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nJohn Finnis, a philosopher, rejected Hume's conception of practical reason on the grounds that human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life. He argued that Hume's conception of practical reason was too narrow and focused on legal and moral principles, while human reason could provide a more comprehensive understanding of what is valuable and meaningful in life."
