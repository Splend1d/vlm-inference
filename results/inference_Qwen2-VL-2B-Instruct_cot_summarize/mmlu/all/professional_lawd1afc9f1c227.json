In order to rebut the presumption that the services rendered were gratuitous, since the nephew was a relative of his uncle, the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. The sister-in-law testified that she had lived in the nephew's house, knew his uncle, and that she was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney asked her to look at a letter and to tell the court whether it was written by the uncle. Upon objection by the attorney for the administrator of the estate, the trial judge would most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.\nB. sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nC. overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.\n"

Overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Context and Jurisdiction**: The case involves a nephew bringing an action against the administrator of his uncle's estate based on a contract for services rendered in the management of his uncle's property. The nephew's sister-in-law is called as a witness to rebut the presumption that the services were gratuitous, since she is a relative of the uncle.\n\n2. **Dead Man's Statute**: The jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect, which means that the sister-in-law's testimony is not admissible as hearsay because she is not a handwriting expert.\n\n3. **Hearsay Rule Exception**: The sister-in-law's testimony is an exception to the hearsay rule because the letter she is asked to look at is a past recollection recorded, which is not considered hearsay.\n\n4. **Overruling Objection**: The trial judge would most likely overrule the objection because the sister-in-law's testimony is an exception to the hearsay rule, and the Dead Man's Statute does not apply to this exception.\n\nTherefore, the nephew's attorney's objection to the sister-in-law's testimony would most likely be overruled."
