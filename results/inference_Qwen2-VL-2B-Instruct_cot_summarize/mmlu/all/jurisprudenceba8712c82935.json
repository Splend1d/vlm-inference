Immunity and disability.\n\nThe scheme of 'jural relations' by Hohfeld distinguishes between rights and duties, privileges and no-privileges, powers and liabilities, and immunities and disabilities. These distinctions are based on the nature of the relationship between the subject and the object of the law. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Right and duty."
