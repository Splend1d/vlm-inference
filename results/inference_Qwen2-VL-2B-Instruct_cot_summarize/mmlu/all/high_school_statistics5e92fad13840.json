He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\n\nA. Because tis more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nD. Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis.

He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nThe t-test statistic of -1.973 is less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, which is approximately 2.069. This means that the observed t-statistic is not statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Therefore, the farmer should not reject the null hypothesis that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is 56 grams."
