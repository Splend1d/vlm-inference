This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.\n\nIn an experiment, the subjects are used as their own controls, meaning that they serve as their own experimental group and serve as their own control group. This is known as the \"within-subjects\" design. In this study, the subjects were randomly selected and given three beers to consume, and their reaction time to a simple stimulus was measured before and after drinking the alcohol. This design allows for the study of the effect of alcohol on reaction time while controlling for any potential confounding variables that might affect both the reaction time and the alcohol consumption."
