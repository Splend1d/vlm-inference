She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?\n\nA. Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR\nB. The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier\nC. The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype\nD. The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained\n"

The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier\n\nThe patient's clinical phenotype, including the presence of thick nasal secretions, sweat that is salty and crystallizes on her skin, and epigastric tenderness, is consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence of a detectable mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene (G551D) suggests that the patient is a CFTR obligate carrier. This means that the patient has one normal allele and one allele with a mutation that causes CF. The obligate carrier status means that the patient will pass the mutation to her offspring, making her a carrier of the CFTR mutation."
