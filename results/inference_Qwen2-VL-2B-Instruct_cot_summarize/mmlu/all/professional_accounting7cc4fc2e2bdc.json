The formula for inventory turnover is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nGiven that the inventory turnover is 5 times on a COGS of $800,000, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ 5 = \\frac{8000000}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nSolving for the average inventory gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{8000000}{5} = 1600000 \\]\n\nNow, if the inventory turnover is improved to 8 times while the COGS remains the same, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ 8 = \\frac{8000000}{\\text{New Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nSolving for the new average inventory gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Average Inventory} = \\frac{8000000}{8} = 1000000 \\]\n\nThe difference between the new average inventory and the old average inventory is:\n\n\\[ 1000000 - 1600000 = -600000 \\]\n\nThis means that $600000 is released from the inventory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $60,000 is released."
