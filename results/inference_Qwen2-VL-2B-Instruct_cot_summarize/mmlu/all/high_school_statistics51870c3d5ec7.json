So, if the original time was 1 minute, the new time would be 60 seconds.\n\nThe standardized score is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the new score (in this case, 60 seconds), \\( \\mu \\) is the mean score (which is 0 in this case), and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (which is 1 in this case).\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean score:\n\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{X + \\mu}{2} = \\frac{60 + 0}{2} = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we find the standard deviation:\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{(X - \\mu)^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(60 - 30)^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{30^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900}{n}} \\]\n\nSince the original time was 1 minute, we have:\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{900}{60}} = \\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the standardized score:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(60 - 30)}{3.87} = \\frac{30}{3.87} \\approx 8.04 \\]\n\nTherefore, the student's standardized score will be approximately 8.04, which corresponds to option B."
