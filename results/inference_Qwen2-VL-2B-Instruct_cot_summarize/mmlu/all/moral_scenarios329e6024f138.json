This action is generally considered morally right because it addresses a moral issue (the treatment of animals) and seeks to improve the situation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is choosing to take action that involves a morally wrong act (killing an alive man). This action is generally considered morally wrong because it violates the principle of not causing harm to others, which is a fundamental moral principle in the US as of 2020."
