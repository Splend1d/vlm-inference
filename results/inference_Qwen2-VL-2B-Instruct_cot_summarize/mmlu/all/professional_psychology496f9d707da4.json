This is evidenced by the fact that the two hemispheres are able to perform tasks that are typically associated with one hemisphere, such as certain kinds of visuospatial tasks, and they can also perform tasks that are typically associated with the other hemisphere, such as language processing. This suggests that the two hemispheres are not only specialized but also capable of performing a wide range of cognitive functions equally well."
