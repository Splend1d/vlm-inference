The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?\n\nA. No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\nB. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\nC. Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.\nD. No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.\n"

The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by claiming that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence.\n\nTo determine whether the lawsuit will be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Strict Liability**: This principle applies when a product is unreasonably dangerous and the manufacturer or seller is not negligent. In this case, the restaurant argues that it did everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product, and therefore there was no negligence.\n\n2. **Voluntary Assumption of Risk**: If the customer voluntarily assumes the risk of consuming a product that contains foreign objects, the seller cannot be held liable for any harm caused by the product.\n\n3. **Cautionary Labels**: If the restaurant had posted a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks, the seller would be held liable for any harm caused by the product.\n\nGiven the scenario, the restaurant's defense hinges on the assumption that the customer voluntarily assumed the risk of consuming a product that might contain foreign objects. If the customer did not voluntarily assume the risk, the restaurant would be held liable for any harm caused by the product.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that even without negligence, strict liability is imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product. This is not necessarily the case here. The restaurant's defense relies on the assumption that the customer voluntarily assumed the risk, not on strict liability.\n\n- **Option B**: This option suggests that the customer voluntarily assumed the risk of consuming a product that might contain foreign objects. This is not necessarily the case here. The customer was caught in her throat by a fish hook, which indicates that the hook was already in her throat when she ate the sandwich, not that she voluntarily assumed the risk.\n\n- **Option C**: This option suggests that customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it. This is not necessarily the case here. The restaurant's defense relies on the assumption that the customer voluntarily assumed the risk, not that customers are expected to know about the risk.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks. This is not necessarily the case here. The restaurant's defense relies on the assumption that the customer voluntarily assumed the risk, not that the seller did not post a warning.\n\nGiven the scenario, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Option B: Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**B. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.**"
