The dimensions of impulse are given by:\n\n\\[ I = L \\cdot M \\cdot T \\]\n\nThis is because impulse is defined as the product of the force (which has dimensions of force, \\( F \\)) and the time over which the force acts (which has dimensions of time, \\( T \\)):\n\n\\[ I = F \\cdot T \\]\n\nSince force and time are both dimensionless (they have no dimensions), the product of two dimensionless quantities results in a dimensionless quantity. Therefore, the dimensions of impulse are:\n\n\\[ I = L \\cdot M \\cdot T \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. LM/T"
