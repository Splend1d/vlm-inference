In nitrogen equilibrium the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is greater than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n   - This statement is incorrect because nitrogen equilibrium means that the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites equals the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n\nB. Positive nitrogen balance means that there is a net loss of protein from the body.\n   - This statement is incorrect because positive nitrogen balance means that the body is synthesizing more protein than it is losing through excretion.\n\nC. In positive nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n   - This statement is incorrect because in positive nitrogen balance, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is greater than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n\nD. In negative nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n   - This statement is correct because in negative nitrogen balance, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds, which indicates that the body is synthesizing more protein than it is losing through excretion.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement about nitrogen balance is:\n\nD. In negative nitrogen balance the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds."
