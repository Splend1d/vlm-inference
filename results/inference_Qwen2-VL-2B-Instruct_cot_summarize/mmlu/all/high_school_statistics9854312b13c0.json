This implies that the events are dependent.\n\n2. **P(E) = 0.32**: This means that the probability of event E occurring is 0.32.\n\n3. **P(F) = 0.15**: This means that the probability of event F occurring is 0.15.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. **The events E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.**\n   - Independence means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is not true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n   - Mutually exclusive means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is not true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nB. **The events E and F are neither independent nor mutually exclusive.**\n   - Independence means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is not true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n   - Mutually exclusive means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is not true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nC. **The events E and F are mutually exclusive but not independent.**\n   - Mutually exclusive means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n   - Independent means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is not true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct.\n\nD. **The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.**\n   - Independent means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is not true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n   - Mutually exclusive means P(E \u2229 F) = 0. This is not true because P(E \u2229 F) = 0.048.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nThe correct conclusion is:\n\n**C. The events E and F are mutually exclusive but not independent.**"
