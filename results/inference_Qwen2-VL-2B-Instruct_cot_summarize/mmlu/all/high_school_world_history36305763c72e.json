They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nThe description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports which of the following inferences about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty?\n\nA. The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.\nB. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.\nC. The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.\nD. The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which inference about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty best supports the given information, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the core of the passage**: The passage describes the procedures followed by Portuguese and other foreigners when trading in China, including the need to remain in boats outside the city, enter a book, and put out their names at night.\n\n2. **Contextualize the passage**: The passage is from a 1599 account by Ralph Fitch, which discusses Portuguese trade in China during the later Ming Dynasty. The passage highlights the strict regulations and procedures followed by Portuguese traders to avoid being imprisoned.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.\"\n     - This option suggests that the Ming Dynasty was open to all forms of trade, which contradicts the passage's description of strict regulations and procedures for Portuguese traders.\n   - **Option B**: \"The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.\"\n     - This option aligns with the passage's description of the strict procedures and regulations applied to Portuguese traders, indicating a desire to limit contact and control trade.\n   - **Option C**: \"The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.\"\n     - This option suggests that the Ming Dynasty was overwhelmed by pirate activity, which is not supported by the passage, which focuses on the procedures for Portuguese traders.\n   - **Option D**: \"The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.\"\n     - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention any restrictions on the number of boats or the specific location of trade.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The passage describes strict procedures and regulations applied to Portuguese traders, indicating a desire to limit contact and control trade. Therefore, the most accurate inference about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty is:\n\n**B. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.**"
