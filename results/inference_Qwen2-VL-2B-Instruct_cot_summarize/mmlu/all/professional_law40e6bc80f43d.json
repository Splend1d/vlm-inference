The government named the investigating FBI agent as its designated representative. Upon learning that the agent would be giving testimony during the trial, the defendant moved that the agent also be excluded from the courtroom. Should the defendant\u00d5s motion be granted?\n\nA. No, provided that the government can show that the agent\u00d5s presence is essential to the presentation of its case.\nB. No, because the government has a right to have its designated representative remain in the courtroom through-out the trial.\nC. Yes, because the agent\u00d5s testimony might be influenced by the testimony of other witnesses.\nD.
