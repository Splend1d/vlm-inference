Then, the speed of Grady is $1.6x$ miles per hour because he rides $60\\%$ faster than Noah.\n\nWe know that Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours. This means that the distance Grady rides is $12$ miles more than Noah's distance. We can write this as an equation:\n\n$$1.6x \\cdot 2 = x \\cdot 2 + 12$$\n\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\n$$3.2x = 2x + 12$$\n\nSubtracting $2x$ from both sides gives:\n\n$$1.2x = 12$$\n\nDividing both sides by $1.2$ gives:\n\n$$x = \\frac{12}{1.2} = 10$$\n\nSo, Noah rides at a speed of $10$ miles per hour. The correct answer is C. 10."
