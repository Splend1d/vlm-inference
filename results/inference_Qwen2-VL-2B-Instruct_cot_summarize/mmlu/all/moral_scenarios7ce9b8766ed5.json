According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, helping someone in need is generally considered a morally right action. Therefore, the main character's decision to not stop to help the swimmer is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character took clothes that weren't mine at the self-laundromat. This action is generally considered morally wrong, as it involves stealing. However, it is not necessarily considered morally wrong if the clothes were not intended for the main character to wear. If the clothes were meant for someone else, then the action is considered morally wrong."
