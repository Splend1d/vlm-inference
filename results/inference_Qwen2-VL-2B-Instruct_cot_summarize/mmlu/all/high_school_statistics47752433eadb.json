This means that we are 90% confident that the true difference in life expectancy lies between 6 and 12 years.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. \"The mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other.\"\n- This is not necessarily true. The confidence interval does not provide information about the ratio of the mean life expectancies. It only tells us about the range of possible differences.\n\nB. \"The mean life expectancy of one model is 6 years, while the mean life expectancy of the other is 12 years.\"\n- This is not necessarily true either. The confidence interval does not provide information about the individual mean life expectancies. It only tells us about the range of possible differences.\n\nC. \"The probability that the life expectancies are different is 0.90.\"\n- This is not necessarily true. The confidence interval only tells us about the range of possible differences, not about the probability of the differences being different.\n\nD. \"We should be 90% confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6 and 12 years.\"\n- This is the most reasonable conclusion. The 90% confidence interval indicates that we are 90% confident that the true difference in life expectancy lies between 6 and 12 years.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is:\n\nD. We should be 90% confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6 and 12 years."
