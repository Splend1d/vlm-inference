Desisting from any act of violence, aggression, or attack.\n2. Not lending support to a third Power in belligerent action.\n3. Maintaining contact for consultation.\n4. Participating in any grouping of Powers aimed at the other party.\n5. Solving disputes or conflicts through friendly exchange of opinion or arbitration commissions.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **had some degree of a nonaggression agreement since at least 1926**\n   - The text mentions that the German Reich and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement that includes desisting from any act of violence, aggression, or attack. This implies that they had some form of nonaggression agreement since at least 1926.\n\nB. **created their first peace agreement in 1926**\n   - The text does not explicitly state that they created their first peace agreement in 1926. It only mentions that they reached an agreement in 1926.\n\nC. **had technically been in a state of war since 1926**\n   - The text does not provide any information about the state of war between Germany and the Soviet Union since 1926. It only mentions that they reached an agreement in 1926.\n\nD. **previously held a peace agreement that expired in 1926**\n   - The text does not provide any information about the expiration date of the peace agreement. It only mentions that they reached an agreement in 1926.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that can be inferred from the text is:\n\n**A. had some degree of a nonaggression agreement since at least 1926**\n\nFinal answer: A."
