Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures the noise in the training data, which can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data.\n\nStatement 2: Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small.\n- This statement is false. The hypothesis space refers to the set of all possible functions that a model can learn. Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small because a small hypothesis space means that the model has fewer options to choose from, which can lead to overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
