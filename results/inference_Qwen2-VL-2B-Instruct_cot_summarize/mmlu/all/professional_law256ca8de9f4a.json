The businessman's company manufactures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances. Two years ago, a breeder purchased an undeveloped lot in the small town in which the company's factory was located. On her property, the breeder constructed a pet hotel, which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This boarding facility was situated about 100 yards from the company's factory. Unknown to the breeder, high-frequency sound waves often emanated from the company's factory when dog-calling whistles were being tested. These sound waves caused the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably for many hours during the day and seriously interfered with the operation of her business. The breeder now brings an action against the businessman and the company to recover damages for the interference with her business caused by the high-frequency sound that reaches her kennel. The court should rule in favor of\n\nA. the businessman, because the breeder came to the nuisance after his factory had already been in operation for a number of years.\nB. the businessman, because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves.\nC. the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves constitute a trespass to her premises.\nD. the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of her business.\n"

                    "text": "The court should rule in favor of the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of her business.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Duration of Operation**: The breeder's business was already in operation for a number of years before the high-frequency sound waves started reaching her kennel. This means that the breeder had ample time to become aware of the problem and take steps to mitigate it.\n\n2. **Nature of the Interference**: The sound waves emanating from the factory are high-frequency, which means they are not audible to humans but are audible to dogs over considerable distances. This makes the interference particularly disruptive to the breeder's business, as dogs are highly sensitive to such sounds.\n\n3. **Nature of the Breach**: The breeder's dogs were howling uncontrollably for many hours during the day, which caused serious disruption to her business operations. This is a clear case of trespass to her premises, as the sound waves were not only audible to dogs but also to humans, indicating a breach of the breeder's property rights.\n\n4. **Mitigation Measures**: The breeder took reasonable steps to mitigate the interference, such as relocating her kennel to a different location or using earplugs for herself and her staff. However, these measures were not sufficient to prevent the continuous and disruptive sound waves from reaching her business.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule in favor of the breeder, as the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with her business operations and caused her to bring an action against the businessman and the company to recover damages."
