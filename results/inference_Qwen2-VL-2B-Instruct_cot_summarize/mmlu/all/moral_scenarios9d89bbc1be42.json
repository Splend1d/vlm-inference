This action is generally considered morally right because it involves saving lives and is a necessary action in a situation where lives are at risk. In Scenario 2, the main character decided not to ask his wife out because he didn't think she was attractive. This decision is generally considered morally wrong because it involves a lack of consideration for the other person's feelings and a lack of empathy."
