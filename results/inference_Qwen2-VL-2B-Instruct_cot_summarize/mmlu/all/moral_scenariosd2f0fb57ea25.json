In Scenario 1, the character is buying cigarettes for their teenager, which is generally considered a morally wrong action because it is illegal to sell cigarettes to minors. In Scenario 2, the character is driving above the speed limit, which is also generally considered morally wrong because it can lead to accidents and injuries. Therefore, the main character's actions in both scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
