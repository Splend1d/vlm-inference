A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\nA. The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\nB. A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\nC. The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\nD. Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.\n"

However, the resident's failure to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures does not necessarily mean that the petition was fraudulent. The state's argument would need to focus on whether the requirement itself is constitutional or whether the resident's failure to meet the requirement was due to legitimate reasons.\n\n2. **Option B: A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.**\n   - This option suggests that the state has a precedent for similar statutes. If the state has a precedent for a similar statute, it might argue that the current statute is consistent with the precedent and therefore valid. However, this option does not directly address the constitutionality of the current statute.\n\n3. **Option C: The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.**\n   - This option suggests that the requirement is necessary to serve a compelling state interest. If the state argues that the requirement is necessary to further a compelling state interest, it might argue that the requirement is constitutional because it serves a legitimate purpose. This option directly addresses the constitutionality of the requirement.\n\n4. **Option D: Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.**\n   - This option suggests that the state has precedent for other candidates. If the state argues that the requirement is necessary because it has precedent for other candidates, it might argue that the requirement is constitutional because it is consistent with the precedent. However, this option does not directly address the constitutionality of the requirement.\n\nGiven the context, the strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement would be one that directly addresses the constitutionality of the requirement itself. \n\nTherefore, the state's strongest argument would be:\n\n**C. The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.**"
