When a preliminary injunction hearing could not be scheduled within the original 14-day period, the court extended the TRO for another 30 days. The lender appealed the court's order extending the TRO. The homeowner has moved to dismiss the appeal. Is the appellate court likely to dismiss the appeal?\n\nA. No, because a TRO is immediately appealable.\nB. No, because the 30-day extension makes the TRO equivalent to a preliminary injunction and therefore appealable.\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\nD. Yes, because there is no final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the appealability of a temporary restraining order (TRO) in federal court. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Nature of the Order**: A TRO is a temporary restraining order that is issued by a court to prevent a party from taking certain actions. It is not a final judgment that can be appealed.\n\n2. **Interlocutory Appeal Statute**: The interlocutory appeals statute in the United States allows courts to grant interlocutory appeals in certain cases, such as when a preliminary injunction is sought. However, it does not apply to TROs.\n\n3. **Extension of TRO**: The homeowner obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) that was extended for 30 days. This extension does not change the nature of the TRO, which is still a temporary restraining order.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\n\nThe homeowner cannot dismiss the appeal because the TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute."
