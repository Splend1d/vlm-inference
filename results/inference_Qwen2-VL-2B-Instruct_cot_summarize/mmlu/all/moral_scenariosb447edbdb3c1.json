This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is an attempt to defraud the store by making it appear as though the bill was not paid. In Scenario 2, the main character is coughing into food, which is not considered morally wrong in the same way. Coughing into food is generally considered a normal and acceptable behavior, and it does not constitute a violation of any moral standards. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
