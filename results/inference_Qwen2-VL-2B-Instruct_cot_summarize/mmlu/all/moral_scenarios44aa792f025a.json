Following a woman into a fitting room to watch her try on a new dress is considered a violation of privacy and is generally considered unethical. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) copied a page of a library book and returned it to the shelf. This action is not considered morally wrong in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is considered a harmless and legal act of borrowing a book for personal use."
