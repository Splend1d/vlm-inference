                    "text": "As a result of the increasing northward movement of the population from a nearby city, a town enacted a zoning ordinance restricting present and future land use in the town to single family dwellings, except in the downtown commercial shopping area, and except for a small area in which multifamily dwellings not over 40 feet in height were permitted. In addition, all new construction or exterior modifications of existing buildings required prior approval of an aesthetic control board. The zoning ordinance defined the term \"family\" in the context of single family dwellings to mean only one or more persons related by marriage, blood, or adoption, thereby excluding unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single residence unit. The enabling legislation contained the following provision:\"This enactment is necessary to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of this community, and preserve and protect the quality of life of its citizens. \"A town resident owns a single family residence with five bedrooms. Prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance, the resident leased the premises on a month-to-month basis to a boyfriend and girlfriend and three other male law students. The five individuals are all unmarried and attend the nearby law school. The resident now brings suit to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance against himself. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance provision that prohibits unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single family residence?\n\nA. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The zoning ordinance would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the resident's rights under the contract clause.\nD. The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n"

The resident in question is a single person who leases a single family residence to unrelated, unmarried individuals. \n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n- This option suggests that the provision violates the due process clause, which is not relevant here since the resident is not a citizen and does not have the right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nB. The zoning ordinance would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n- This option suggests that the provision violates the equal protection clause, which is relevant here since the ordinance discriminates against unrelated, unmarried individuals.\n\nC. The zoning ordinance provision would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the resident's rights under the contract clause.\n- This option suggests that the provision violates the contract clause, which is not relevant here since the resident is not a party to a contract.\n\nD. The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n- This option suggests that the provision is constitutional under the state's police power, which is relevant here since the ordinance is intended to preserve the physical and social homogeneity of the community and protect the quality of life for its citizens.\n\nGiven the context and the purpose of the zoning ordinance, the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the provision is:\n\nD. The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n\nFinal answer: D."
