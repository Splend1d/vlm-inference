The law in question is designed to prevent children from attending public schools in the state if they have not lived there for at least one year.

The one-year residence requirement is valid because it does not affect any fundamental right or suspect class.\n- This statement is not accurate. The law is designed to reduce state expenditures, not to affect fundamental rights or suspect classes. It does not violate any fundamental right or suspect class.\n\nB. State durational residence requirements that are estab-lished for publicly funded services are constitutional because they relate to government operations reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\n- This statement is not accurate. The Tenth Amendment does not specifically relate to education or public services. The law is not based on the Tenth Amendment.\n\nC. Because publicly funded education is a fundamental constitutional right, a state may not deny it to any class of persons who reside in that state.\n- This statement is not accurate. The law is not based on the fundamental right to education. It is designed to reduce state expenditures, not to deny access to education.\n\nD.
