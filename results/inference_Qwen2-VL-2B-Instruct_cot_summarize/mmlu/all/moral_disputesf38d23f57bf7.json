Singer suggests that a global ban would not be effective. Therefore, the question is asking for a \"bolder\" strategy that would be more effective in preventing genetic engineering beyond eliminating obvious defects.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Creating a world military that would enforce the ban with greater strength:\n- This option involves a military intervention, which is a very strong and potentially disruptive strategy. However, it is not necessarily bolder than the global ban itself, which is already a strong measure.\n\nB. Required genetic engineering for every newborn child:\n- This option involves a very strict and potentially restrictive measure. It is not bolder than the global ban, which is already very restrictive.\n\nC. Using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering:\n- This option involves a more gradual and gradual approach. It is not bolder than the global ban, which is already very restrictive.\n\nD. None of the above:\n- This option suggests that there is no \"bolder\" strategy that Singer suggests. However, the question implies that Singer suggests a strategy that is not bolder than the global ban.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the question, the most bolder strategy suggested by Singer would be:\n\nC. Using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering.\n\nFinal answer: C. Using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering."
