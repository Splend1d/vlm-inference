In other words, it is the value that corresponds to the 25th percentile of the distribution.\n\nThe mean of the distribution is 45 g, and the standard deviation is 4 g. We can use the z-score formula to find the value that corresponds to the 25th percentile:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the value we want to find, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (x - 45) / 4\n\nWe want to find the value of x that corresponds to the 25th percentile, so we want to find the value of x that makes z = 0.5.\n\nSetting z = 0.5, we get:\n\n0.5 = (x - 45) / 4\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 45 + 0.5 * 4 = 45.5\n\nSo the mass of egg that would be the 25th percentile of the masses of all the eggs is 45.5 g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 42.5 g."
