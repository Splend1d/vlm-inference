This action is clearly morally wrong because it involves intentionally causing harm to someone's health and well-being for the sake of personal gain. In scenario 2, the main character did not go to school because they wanted to watch television. This is not considered morally wrong because it is a personal choice and does not involve any harm to others or the environment."
