Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert 5 feet to inches:\n\n\\[5 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 60 \\text{ inches}\\]\n\nAdding the additional 8 inches for each student:\n\n\\[60 \\text{ inches} + 8 \\text{ inches} = 68 \\text{ inches}\\]\n\nSince there are 32 students, we multiply the total inches by 32:\n\n\\[68 \\text{ inches} \\times 32 = 2224 \\text{ inches}\\]\n\nTo convert inches back to feet and inches, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):\n\n\\[2224 \\text{ inches} \\div 12 = 181 \\text{ feet} \\text{ and } 4 \\text{ inches}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of rope Ms. Gutierrez needs to order is 181 feet and 4 inches.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 181 feet 4 inches."
