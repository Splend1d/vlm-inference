In Scenario 1, the character took a photo of their dog getting washed in the bath. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves taking a picture of a pet in distress, which can be considered disrespectful and inappropriate. In Scenario 2, the character knew their dog was fond of spiders and picked one up to show it to her. This action is also generally considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm to the spider, which is not a natural behavior for spiders and can be harmful to the spider's well-being."
