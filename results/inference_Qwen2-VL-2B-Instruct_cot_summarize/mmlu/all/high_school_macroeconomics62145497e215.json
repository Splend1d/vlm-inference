An increase in demand increasing the interest rate.\n\nAn increase in corporate optimism generally leads to an increase in demand for loanable funds, as businesses and individuals are more likely to borrow money to invest in new projects or expand their operations. This increased demand for loanable funds will likely result in an increase in the supply of loanable funds, as banks and other financial institutions are more willing to lend money due to the higher demand. As a result, the interest rate will likely increase to maintain the balance between the supply and demand of loanable funds."
