This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves a lack of consideration for the stranger's needs or well-being. In scenario 2, the main character is going to build a roomy bomb shelter just so they can save the whole neighborhood. This action is morally wrong because it involves the potential for harm to others, specifically the community, and it is not a morally justifiable act."
