Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.\nD. The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime.

Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.\n\nTransnational organized criminal activities (TNC) are characterized by the following key features:\n\n1. Profit-driven crime: TNC are organized criminal groups that engage in criminal activities with the goal of generating profits. These profits are often reinvested into the criminal enterprise, allowing the group to continue its operations.\n\n2. High level return: TNC are often involved in activities that generate significant profits, which can be used to support the group's operations and activities.\n\n3. Subversion or infiltration of the legal economy: TNC may use their criminal activities to subvert or infiltrate the legal economy, making it difficult for law enforcement to effectively pursue them.\n\n4. Involvement in illicit profits: TNC may engage in activities that involve the reinvestment of illicit profits, such as drug trafficking or money laundering.\n\n5. Continuity of membership: TNC are often structured and have a developed role for their members, with a continuity of membership that allows for the organization to continue its operations.\n\n6. Pursuit of profit for illicit activity: TNC are often engaged in activities that are not defined and may include those individuals or businesses that engage in occasional transnational criminal activity but are otherwise legitimate operatives.\n\nWhile TNC may be organized transnational crime groups, they are not necessarily structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes."
