An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\n\nWhen a sister transfers her interest in the ranch by quitclaim deed to her friend without the brother's knowledge, the friend acquires an undivided one-half interest in the ranch. This means the friend has a half of the ranch's interest, but there is no right of survivorship. The brother retains his undivided one-half interest, and the sister's interest is transferred to her friend."
