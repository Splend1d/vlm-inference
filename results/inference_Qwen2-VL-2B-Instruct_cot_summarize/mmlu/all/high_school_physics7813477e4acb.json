This relationship is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\cdot V \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the charge stored on the capacitor,\n- \\( C \\) is the capacitance of the capacitor,\n- \\( V \\) is the voltage applied to the capacitor.\n\nGiven that the 2 \u03bcF capacitor stores 600 \u03bcC of charge, we can find the charge stored on a 18 \u03bcF capacitor by rearranging the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\cdot V \\]\n\n\\[ 600 \\, \\mu C = 2 \\, \\mu F \\cdot V \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{600 \\, \\mu C}{2 \\, \\mu F} \\]\n\n\\[ V = 300 \\, \\mu V \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the charge stored on each of the three 18 \u03bcF capacitors when they are connected in series to the same 300 \u03bcV voltage. Since the capacitors are in series, the charge on each capacitor is the same as the voltage applied to them. Therefore, the charge stored on each of the three capacitors is:\n\n\\[ Q = V = 300 \\, \\mu C \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 100 \u03bcC"
