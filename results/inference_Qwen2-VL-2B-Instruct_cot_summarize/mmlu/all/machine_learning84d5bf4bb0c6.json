The VC dimension of an SVM is not directly related to the complexity of the decision boundary it can make. The complexity of the decision boundary is determined by the complexity of the decision function, which is the function that maps the input space to a binary value. The VC dimension of an SVM is related to the complexity of the decision function, but it does not directly determine the complexity of the decision boundary.\n\nStatement 2: A two layer neural network with linear activation functions is essentially a weighted combination of linear separators, trained on a given dataset; the boosting algorithm built on linear separators also finds a combination of linear separators, therefore these two algorithms will give the same result.\n\nThis statement is true.
