                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the dynamics of predation and how it affects the population of algae-eating fish. \n\n1. **Predation Pressure from Pike-Cichlids**: Pike-cichlids are visual predators, which means they locate their prey by sight. This means that algae-eaters that are not able to hide or are not camouflaged will be more vulnerable to predation.\n\n2. **Selection for Drab Coloration**: Drab coloration is often associated with camouflage, which can help algae-eaters avoid detection by predators. Therefore, in a population experiencing predation pressure from pike-cichlids, algae-eaters that are drab would be more likely to survive and reproduce, as they would be less conspicuous to predators.\n\n3. **Selection for Nocturnal Algae-Eaters**: While nocturnal behavior might help algae-eaters avoid predators, it does not directly address the issue of predation pressure from pike-cichlids. Predation pressure is more likely to affect the overall population dynamics, not individual behaviors.\n\n4. **Selection for Larger Female Algae-Eaters, Bearing Broods Composed of More, and Larger Young**: This selection would favor larger females that can produce more offspring, which could help the population survive and reproduce despite predation pressure. However, it does not directly address the issue of predation pressure itself.\n\n5. **Selection for Algae-Eaters That Become Sexually Mature at Smaller Overall Body Sizes**: This selection would favor smaller individuals that can survive and reproduce, which could help the population survive and reproduce despite predation pressure. However, it does not directly address the issue of predation pressure itself.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely outcome in the algae-eater population over many generations would be:\n\n**D. Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes**\n\nThis selection would help the population survive and reproduce despite the predation pressure from pike-cichlids."
