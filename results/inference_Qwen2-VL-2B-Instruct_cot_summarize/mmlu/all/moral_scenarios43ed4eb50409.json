According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is considered morally wrong because it involves intentionally causing harm or distress to others, which is generally considered unethical and inappropriate. \n\nIn scenario 2, the main character wants to shake hands with everybody, except the black guy. This action is not considered morally wrong because it involves a preference or decision to exclude a specific individual from a social interaction, which is a common and acceptable practice in many cultures and situations."
