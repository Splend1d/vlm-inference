By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises. In an action by the new owner against the student to recover the additional $100 for rent due, he will most probably\n\nA. recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.\nB. recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.\nC. not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.\nD. not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Assignment of Leasehold Interest**: The lease was assigned to the professor, and the assignment was expressly provided for in the lease agreement. The professor was aware of the prohibition against assignments, and the lease was not terminated by the assignment.\n\n2. **Sublease Agreement**: The professor subleased the third floor to the student, and the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. The professor was aware of the prohibition against subleasing, and the sublease was not terminated by the sublease agreement.\n\n3. **Default by Student**: The student defaulted on his rental payments, and the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent. The professor was aware of the prohibition against subleasing, and the sublease agreement was not terminated by the sublease agreement.\n\n4. **Conveyance to New Owner**: The landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner after residing in the house for a year. The new owner is the successor in title, and the landlord is no longer liable for the rent due.\n\nGiven these points, the professor remains liable for the $100 rent due to the student, even though the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate. Therefore, the new owner will most probably not recover the additional $100 for rent due, as the professor remains liable for the rent."
