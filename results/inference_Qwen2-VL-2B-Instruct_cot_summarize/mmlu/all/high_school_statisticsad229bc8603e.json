By the law of large numbers, the next toss is more likely to be an odd number than another even number.\n- The law of large numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the outcomes approaches the expected value. However, this does not directly relate to the probability of the next toss being an even number given that three in a row have been even. The law of large numbers does not provide information about the probability of the next toss being an odd number.\n\nB. Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\n- Conditional probability states that the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. In this case, the event is \"the next toss is even,\" and the given event is \"three in a row have been even.\" The conditional probability of the next toss being even given that three in a row have been even is indeed higher than the probability of the next toss being odd given that three in a row have been even. This is because the probability of the next toss being even is higher than the probability of the next toss being odd.\n\nC. Dice actually do have memories, and thus the number that comes up on the next toss will be influenced by the previous tosses.\n- This statement is not supported by any of the given options. The properties of dice and the law of large numbers do not imply that the outcome of the next toss is influenced by previous tosses.\n\nD. The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\n- The probability of an event occurring is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since the die is fair and each number has an equal chance of coming up, the probability of the next toss being even is 1/2 or 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
