At least some nonhuman beings:\nThis option suggests that the ethical stance should include at least some nonhuman beings. This aligns with the idea that nonhuman beings have moral standing, as they are capable of experiencing emotions, suffering, and moral agency.\n\nB. At least some nonconscious beings:\nThis option suggests that the ethical stance should include at least some nonconscious beings. Nonconscious beings are those that do not have the capacity for consciousness, which means they lack the ability to experience emotions, suffer, or have moral agency. This option does not align with the idea of nonhuman beings having direct moral standing.\n\nC. Both A and B:\nThis option suggests that the ethical stance should include both nonhuman beings and nonconscious beings. This is a more inclusive stance than either A or B, as it acknowledges the moral standing of both nonhuman and nonconscious beings.\n\nD. Neither A nor B; an environmental ethic may deny that there are any nonhuman and nonconscious beings with direct moral standing:\nThis option suggests that an environmental ethic may deny the moral standing of nonhuman and nonconscious beings. This is a more extreme stance, as it denies the moral standing of nonhuman and nonconscious beings altogether.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that holds direct moral standing for an environmental ethic is:\n\nA. At least some nonhuman beings\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that nonhuman beings have moral standing, as they are capable of experiencing emotions, suffering, and moral agency."
