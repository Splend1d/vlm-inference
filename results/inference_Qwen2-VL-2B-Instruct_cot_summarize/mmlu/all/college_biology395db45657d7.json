The K value, which is the carrying capacity of the environment, represents the maximum population size that the environment can sustain without becoming overpopulated. Once the K value is reached, further increases in population size will result in a decrease in population size due to factors such as predation, competition, and environmental stress. Therefore, the most effective means of controlling the mosquito population is to opt for zero population control once the K value of the curve has been reached, which means reducing the population size to below the carrying capacity."
