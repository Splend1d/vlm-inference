Since I is true, (J \u2261 K) must also be true. This is an immediate consequence of the given premises.\n\n**C. I \u2283 (L \u2228 M)**\n- From the second premise, we have (J \u2261 K) \u2283 (L \u2228 M). Since (J \u2261 K) is true, either L or M must be true. This is not an immediate consequence of the given premises because it requires additional information about L and M.\n\n**D. ~L \u2283 (J \u2261 K)**\n- From the third premise, we have I \u2283 ~L. Since I is true, ~L must also be true.
