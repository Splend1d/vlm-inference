He believed that morality is a matter of personal choice and that it is ultimately up to individuals to determine what is right or wrong based on their own beliefs and values. However, he also believed that there are certain moral principles that are universal and should be followed by all individuals, regardless of personal beliefs. These principles are based on reason and reason alone, and Bentham believed that they should be applied to all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or personal beliefs."
