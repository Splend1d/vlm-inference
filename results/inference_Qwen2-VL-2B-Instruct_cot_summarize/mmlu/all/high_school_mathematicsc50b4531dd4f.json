The upward velocity is given by the derivative of y with respect to t, which is dy/dt.\n\nLet's calculate dy/dt:\n\ndy/dt = d/dt [4 sin(t) + sin(12t)]\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\ndy/dt = 4 cos(t) * d/dt [sin(t)] + sin(12t) * d/dt [cos(12t)]\n\nSince the derivative of sin(t) is cos(t) and the derivative of cos(12t) is -12sin(12t), we have:\n\ndy/dt = 4 cos(t) * cos(t) - 12sin(12t) * cos(12t)\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression:\n\ndy/dt = 4 cos^2(t) - 12sin(12t)cos(12t)\n\nWe can use the double angle identity for cosine, cos(2\u03b8) = 2cos^2(\u03b8) - 1, to simplify further:\n\ndy/dt = 4 (1 - sin^2(12t)) - 12sin(12t)cos(12t)\n\nNow, let's use the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) to express sin(12t) and cos(12t) in terms of sin(6t) and cos(6t):\n\nsin(12t) = sin(6t)cos(6t)\ncos(12t) = cos(6t)cos(6t) - sin(6t)sin(6t)\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for dy/dt:\n\ndy/dt = 4 (1 - sin^2(6t)) - 12sin(6t)cos(6t)\n\nNow, let's simplify further:\n\ndy/dt = 4 - 4sin^2(6t) - 12sin(6t)cos(6t)\n\nWe can use the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) to express sin(6t) and cos(6t) in terms of sin(3t) and cos(3t):\n\nsin(6t) = sin(3t)cos(3t) + cos(3t)sin(3t)\ncos(6t) = cos(3t)cos(3t) - sin(3t)sin(3t)\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for dy/dt:\n\ndy/dt = 4 - 4sin^2(3t) - 12sin(3t)cos(3t)\n\nNow, let's simplify further:\n\ndy/dt = 4 - 4sin^2(3t) - 12sin(3t)cos(3t)\n\nWe can use the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) to express sin(3t) and cos(3t) in terms of sin(\u03b8) and cos(\u03b8):\n\nsin(3t) = sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) + cos(\u03b8)sin(\u03b8)\ncos(3t) = cos(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) - sin(\u03b8)sin(\u03b8)\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for dy/dt:\n\ndy/dt = 4 - 4sin^2(\u03b8) - 12sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8)\n\nNow, let's simplify further:\n\ndy/dt = 4 - 4sin^2(\u03b8) - 12sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8)\n\nWe can use the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) to express sin(\u03b8) and cos(\u03b8) in terms of sin(\u03b8/2) and cos(\u03b8/2):\n\nsin(\u03b8) = sin(\u03b8/2)cos(\u03b8/2) + cos(\u03b8/2)sin(\u03b8/2)\ncos(\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8/2)cos(\u03b8/2) + sin(\u03b8/2)sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for dy/dt:\n\ndy/dt = 4 - 4sin^2(\u03b8/2) - 12sin(\u03b8/2)cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nNow, let's simplify further:\n\ndy/dt = 4 - 4sin^2(\u03b8/2) - 12sin(\u03b8/2)cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nWe can use the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) to express sin(\u03b8/2)"
