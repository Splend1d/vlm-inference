Graves' disease is characterized by an overactive thyroid gland, which can cause symptoms such as heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). The MRI of the head and orbits will most likely reveal diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles, which are muscles that help to stabilize the eye and maintain eye position. Therefore, the correct answer is B. diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles."
