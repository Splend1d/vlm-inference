ADF is a single equation approach to unit root testing while PP is a systems approach\nB. PP tests reverse the DF null and alternative hypotheses so that there is stationarity under the null hypothesis of the PP test\nC. The PP test incorporates an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression\nD. PP tests have good power in small samples whereas DF tests do not.\n"
