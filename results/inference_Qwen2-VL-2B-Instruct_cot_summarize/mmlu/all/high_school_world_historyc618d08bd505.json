It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA.

The passage discusses the struggle against neo-colonialism and non-alignment, which are related to the Cold War era.

The passage mentions non-alignment, which is a policy that involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. This aligns with the ideological differences between the capitalist and socialist blocs.\n\nB. **The competing ideologies of World War II**:\n   - This option refers to the ideological differences between the capitalist and socialist blocs during World War II. The passage does not discuss the ideological differences between the capitalist and socialist blocs during World War II.\n\nC. **The competing empires of World War I**:\n   - This option refers to the territorial disputes and colonial empires during World War I. The passage does not discuss territorial disputes or colonial empires during World War I.\n\nD. **The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa**:\n   - This option refers to the colonial empires and the scramble for Africa during the Scramble for Africa.

The competing ideologies of the Cold War**"
