Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway.\n\nDrive-reduction theories, which focus on reducing the drive to eat, would not provide a reasonable explanation for Kezia's decision to order the strawberry cheesecake despite being very full. This decision is more likely to be influenced by factors such as the availability of the dessert, the social context, or personal preferences rather than a reduction in drive to eat."
