In a hypothesis test at the 10% significance level (\u03b1 = 0.10), the significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Therefore, the probability of a Type II error is the complement of the significance level, which is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0.90."
