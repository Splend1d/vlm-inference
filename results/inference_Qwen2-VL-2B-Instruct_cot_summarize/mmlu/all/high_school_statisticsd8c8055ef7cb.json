The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the probability of either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occurring is given by:\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\]\n\nGiven that the probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72, and the probability that they both ask her is 0.18, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[0.72 = 0.6 + 0.18 - P(A \\cap B)\\]\n\nSolving for \\(P(A \\cap B)\\):\n\n\\[P(A \\cap B) = 0.6 + 0.18 - 0.72 = 0.24\\]\n\nThis means the probability that both Alfred and Ben ask Charlene is 0.24. Since the probability that they both ask her is 0.18, the probability that Ben asks her is:\n\n\\[P(B) = 0.18 - 0.24 = -0.06\\]\n\nHowever, probabilities cannot be negative, so there must be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the given information. Given the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem or the provided information. The correct interpretation should be that the probability that both Alfred and Ben ask her is 0.18, not that they both ask her. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.3"
