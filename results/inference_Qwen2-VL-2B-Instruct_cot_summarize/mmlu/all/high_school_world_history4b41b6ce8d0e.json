The inscription mentions that Sassanid Persia was a place where many divine services were performed in magnificence and many Warham fires were established, indicating a high level of religious and spiritual activity.\n2. The inscription also states that many magi became happy and prosperous, and many fires and magi were imperially installed, suggesting a flourishing of religious practices and a sense of community.\n3. The presence of Sassanid Persia as a place where many divine services were performed and many magi became happy and prosperous indicates a high level of religious activity and a community of believers.\n\nGiven these points, the most fitting explanation is:\n\nC. Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India.\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that Sassanid Persia was a place where trade routes intersected, which could have attracted and supported a diverse range of religious communities, including Buddhism. The trade routes facilitated cultural exchange and the spread of various religions, including Buddhism, which could have been a significant factor in Sassanid Persia's religious landscape."
