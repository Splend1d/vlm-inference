Which of the following is true about water potential?\n\nA. An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\nD. Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\n"

Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\n\nIn the context of osmosis, the water potential is determined by the difference between the solute concentration of the two solutions. The higher the solute concentration, the greater the driving force for water to move from the solution with the lower solute concentration to the solution with the higher solute concentration. This is because the solute concentration gradient drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential."
