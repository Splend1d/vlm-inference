During the MRI, the technicians saw at least two identifiable sponges that had been left in her body. She had to be hospitalized for additional surgery. The patient sued the hospital and doctor for medical malpractice. She did not produce the printouts of the MRI. Instead, she attempted to testify to what she observed on the MRI scan. The defense objected and insisted that she must produce the actual MRI printouts. What is the most likely ruling of the trial judge with respect to the objection?\n\nA. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson can testify to things of common knowledge, such as what a sponge looks like.\nB. She does have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson cannot testify to personal observations.\nC. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because she can testify as to the content of her own medical records.\nD. She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.\n"

She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.\n\nThe best evidence rule in legal proceedings requires that the evidence presented by the plaintiff must be the most reliable and trustworthy. In this case, the MRI scan is considered the best evidence because it is a medical imaging tool that provides a detailed and accurate depiction of the patient's body, including the presence of sponges. The patient's testimony about what she observed on the MRI scan is not considered reliable or trustworthy because it is based on her personal observations, which may not be as accurate or objective as the medical imaging itself. Therefore, the MRI scan is the best evidence and must be produced by the patient in order to establish the facts of the case."
