Instead, he hit and injured a hiker. The hunter had not realized that the hiker was there. Does the injured hiker have an actionable battery claim against the hunter?\n\nA. No, because the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\nB. No, because the hunter did not make direct physical contact with the hiker.\nC. Yes, because the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker.\nD. Yes, because the hunter intentionally shot the rifle.\n"

Yes, because the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker.\n\nThe key to understanding this claim is to recognize that the hunter's actions were intentional and resulted in physical contact with the hiker. The hiker was not merely a bystander or an accidental visitor; he was a target of the hunter's action. The bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker, which is the essence of battery. Therefore, the hiker has a claim against the hunter for battery.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\n   - This option suggests that the hunter's actions were unintentional or without a specific intent to harm the hiker. However, the bullet made direct physical contact, indicating a specific intent to injure.\n\nB. No, because the hunter did not make direct physical contact with the hiker.\n   - This option implies that the hiker was not physically touched by the hunter. However, the bullet made direct physical contact, making this option incorrect.\n\nD. Yes, because the hunter intentionally shot the rifle.\n   - This option suggests that the hunter's actions were accidental or unintentional. However, the bullet made direct physical contact, indicating a specific intent to injure, which makes this option incorrect."
