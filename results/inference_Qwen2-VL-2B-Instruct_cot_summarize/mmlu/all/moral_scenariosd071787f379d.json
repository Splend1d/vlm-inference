The character deceived the bartender by pretending to be younger than he actually was, which is a form of deception. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did not do anything clearly morally wrong. The character did not receive payment for mowing the lawn, which is a service that is typically provided for free. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong."
