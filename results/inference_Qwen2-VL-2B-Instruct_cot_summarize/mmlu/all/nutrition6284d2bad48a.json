Flavonoids and isoflavonoids are both subclasses of the flavonoid class.\n\nB. The digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing.\n- This statement is incorrect. Isoflavones, like many other plant compounds, can be affected by processing. For example, processing can change the bioavailability of isoflavones in soy products.\n\nC. \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A.\n- This statement is incorrect. \u00df-Carotene is a provitamin A precursor, while lycopene is not. Lycopene is a carotenoid that is not a provitamin A.\n\nD. Carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.\n- This statement is incorrect. Carotenoids are a type of polyphenol, but flavonoids are not. Flavonoids are a different class of polyphenols.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nA. The flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids."
