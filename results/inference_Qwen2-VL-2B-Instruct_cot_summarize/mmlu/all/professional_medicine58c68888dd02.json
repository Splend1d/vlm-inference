The patient was at home at the time of the seizure. In the emergency department, she is given an additional 0.5 mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates. Within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation, followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications. Temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency?\n\nA. Airway occlusion\nB. Encephalitis\nC. Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive\nD. Meningitis\n"

Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive\n\nThe patient's history of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and subsequent administration of diazepam suggests a potential underlying cause of respiratory insufficiency. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine medication that can suppress central respiratory drive, leading to respiratory depression. This suppression can be exacerbated by other factors such as hypoxia, hypoglycemia, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency is medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive."
