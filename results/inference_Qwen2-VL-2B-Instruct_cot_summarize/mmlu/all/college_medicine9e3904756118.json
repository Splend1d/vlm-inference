In DNA replication, the template strand is copied into a new strand, and the new strand is complementary to the original template strand.\n\nGiven that the original template strand had a ratio of 3:2 of A:T bases, we can assume that the original template strand was a mixture of A and T bases in a 3:2 ratio. This means that for every 3 A bases, there are 2 T bases.\n\nWhen a section of the template strand is copied into a new strand, the ratio of A:T in the new strand will be the same as the original template strand. This is because the copying process is a mirror image of the original template strand.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complimentary strand of DNA is:\n\nC. 2:03"
