Sepuku is a form of suicide that involves self-immolation, which is considered a form of murder and is considered morally wrong by many people.\n\nScenario 2: I held her head in a pot of boiling water. This action is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Holding someone's head in boiling water is considered a form of torture and is considered morally wrong by many people. However, it is not considered murder, as it is not an intentional killing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
