When a person is exposed to a cold environment, their body temperature increases to maintain homeostasis. This increase in body temperature can cause the brain to perceive the environment as warmer than it actually is. Conversely, when a person is in a warm environment, their body temperature decreases, and the brain may perceive the environment as cooler than it actually is. This is why a pool with water temperature of 82 degrees may feel cool to a person who has been sunbathing, yet warm to a person who has been inside in the air conditioning."
