After its successful application during the Cold War, arms control has retained its momentum and applicability in the contemporary security environment.\n\nArms control is a strategic policy that involves the reduction or limitation of the deployment of nuclear weapons and other strategic weapons. It is designed to address the security dilemma, which is the conflict between the desire for security and the need for disarmament. The policies of arms control and disarmament were pursued during the Cold War in an attempt to achieve security, but they have not been applied consistently in the contemporary security environment. The application of arms control during the Cold War was successful in reducing the number of nuclear weapons and reducing tensions between the superpowers, but it has not been applied consistently in the contemporary security environment. Therefore, option D does not characterize arms control as a strategic policy."
