A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia\n\nDystonia is a type of involuntary movement disorder characterized by sustained, repetitive, and abnormal muscle contractions. A 'milkmaid' grip is a common example of dystonia, where the fingers are clenched into a fist, resembling the way a milkmaid might hold a bottle. This grip is often seen in patients with dystonia and can be a symptom of the condition itself."
