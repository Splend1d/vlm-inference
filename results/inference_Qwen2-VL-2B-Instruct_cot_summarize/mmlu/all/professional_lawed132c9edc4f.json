It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"A group of teachers who work for a public school inside of the city were angry that the principal decreased their salaries. The teachers reacted by picketing on the lawn of the principal's privately owned house. The teachers were charged with violating Section 202 of the ordinance. The teachers have filed suit attacking the constitutionality of Section 202. The court will most likely declare Section 202\n\nA. constitutional, as a permissible time, place, and manner regulation.\nB. constitutional, as a valid exercise of a state's reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. unconstitutional, as discriminatory on its face.\nD. unconstitutional, as vague and overbroad.\n"

The teachers' picketing on the principal's lawn is a violation of this prohibition.\n\n2. **Section 202's Scope**: The ordinance is a time, place, and manner regulation, which means it restricts the time, place, and manner of activities that are generally protected by the First Amendment. The teachers' picketing on the principal's lawn is not generally protected by the First Amendment, as it is a private property.\n\n3. **Constitutionality of Section 202**: The teachers' picketing on the principal's lawn is a clear violation of Section 202, which is a time, place, and manner regulation. This is a clear case of discrimination on its face, as it restricts the teachers' ability to engage in their lawful activities.\n\nTherefore, the court is most likely to declare Section 202 unconstitutional, as it is discriminatory on its face."
