The yield is the annual rate of return that the bondholder expects to receive from the bond. In this case, the yield is 4%, which means that the bondholder expects to receive 4% of the face value of the bond each year.\n\nThe present value of the bond's cash flows can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPV = FV / (1 + r)^n\n\nwhere PV is the present value, FV is the face value, r is the yield, and n is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, the present value of the bond's cash flows is:\n\nPV = $100 / (1 + 0.04)^5 = $82.73\n\nTherefore, the price of the bond is $82.73, which is closest to option C."
