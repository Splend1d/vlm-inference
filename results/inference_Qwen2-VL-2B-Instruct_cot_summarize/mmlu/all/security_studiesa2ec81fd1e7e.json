Unlike Category A agents, B agents refer to emerging security threats which have the potential to be utilised as biological weapons after further development.\nC.

Category B agents include food and water security threats, with moderate morbidity rates.\n\nCategory B agents are defined as those that present little to no risk or morbidity within infected populations, but can have detrimental effects on the ability of a group to perform physical tasks. They are not considered to be high-risk or high-mortality threats, but they do pose a significant threat to public health and safety."
