High density in the core\n\nThe core-periphery model of development suggests that the core is the most developed and advanced region, while the periphery is less developed and less advanced. The core is characterized by high density, high cost of labor, and more infrastructure. The periphery, on the other hand, is characterized by low density, low cost of labor, and less infrastructure. Therefore, high density in the core is not a spread effect in the core-periphery model of development."
