In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security.\n- This statement is accurate. The R2P approach often relies on the idea of international security to justify intervention, which is a core aspect of Westphalian sovereignty.\n\nB. In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty.\n- This statement is accurate. The R2P approach aims to redefine sovereignty to include the duty to protect citizens, which is a significant departure from traditional Westphalian notions.\n\nC. In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty.\n- This statement is accurate. The R2P approach seeks to redefine sovereignty to include the duty to protect, which is a significant departure from traditional Westphalian sovereignty.\n\nD. The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.\n- This statement is not accurate. The R2P approach does not inherently link sovereignty with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens. It focuses on the duty to protect citizens, not necessarily the duty to protect the interests of citizens.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not accurate is:\n\nD. The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens."
