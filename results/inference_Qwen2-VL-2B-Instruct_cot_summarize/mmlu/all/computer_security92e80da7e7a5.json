Compiling the program with address sanitizer (ASAN) will make the source of a memory error easier to find\n\nAddress sanitizer (ASAN) is a tool that is used to detect and prevent memory errors in programs. When an ASAN is used, it will check the program's memory for any potential errors and mark them as invalid. This makes it easier to identify the source of a memory error because the program will not be able to access the invalid memory locations."
