Producing a hybrid cell.\n\nHybrid cells are created by fusing two different cell types, typically from different species, to form a new cell that has characteristics of both parental cells. In this case, the fusion of mouse and human cells would result in a hybrid cell that contains both mouse and human cell characteristics. This would allow for the observation of proteins moving about in a plane of the plasma membrane, as well as the integration of mouse and human cell-surface proteins along a fused mouse-human cell plasma membrane."
