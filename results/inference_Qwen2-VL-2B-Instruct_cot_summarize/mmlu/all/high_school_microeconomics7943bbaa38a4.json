The good is normal and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\n\nWhen a good is normal, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect. This means that an increase in income leads to an increase in demand for the good, as the consumer has more disposable income to spend on it. However, the substitution effect is weaker, meaning that a decrease in the price of a substitute good will not necessarily lead to an increase in demand for the normal good. Therefore, a decrease in the price of the normal good will cause a decrease in quantity demanded, as the consumer has less disposable income to spend on it. This is represented by an upward-sloping demand curve."
