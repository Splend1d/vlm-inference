This is because the alleles for gray body and vestigial wings are dominant and the alleles for black body and vestigial wings are recessive. Therefore, the offspring will have a 50% chance of being heterozygous for the gray body and vestigial wings allele and a 50% chance of being homozygous for the black body and vestigial wings allele. This is an example of segregation of alleles, where the alleles for different traits segregate independently during meiosis."
