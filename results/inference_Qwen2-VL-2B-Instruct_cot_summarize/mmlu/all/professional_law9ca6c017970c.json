The decision to provide additional support for the restaurant expansion was reasonable and necessary for the expansion to proceed. The neighboring property owner has no legal right to claim trespass because the restaurant did not trespass on his property. The restaurant owner's actions were within the scope of their business and were not disruptive to the peaceful enjoyment of the neighboring property. Therefore, the restaurant owner is likely to prevail in the lawsuit. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. The restaurant owner, because there was no disturbance of peaceful enjoyment of the neighboring property."
