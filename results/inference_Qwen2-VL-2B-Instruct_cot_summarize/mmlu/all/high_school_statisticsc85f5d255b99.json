Since we don't have the exact proportion, we can use the given information to estimate it. Let's assume the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is 0.5 (this is a common value for a 90% confidence interval with a margin of error of 0.08).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ n = \\left( \\frac{1.645^2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot (1-0.5)}{0.08^2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\left( \\frac{2.7069 \\cdot 0.25}{0.0064} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\left( \\frac{0.6765}{0.0064} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ n = 106.84117647 \\]\n\nSince the sample size must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 107.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 106"
