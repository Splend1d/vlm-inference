Billy thought Jack was a weakling, but Jack had been working out with weights and knew karate. Ike Intervenor, a large 25-year-old who knew neither party, strolled around the corner of the block in time to see Jack strike Billy twice. Billy fell back and Jack stepped forward to strike him again. Ike thought Jack was the aggressor and to protect Billy, Ike threw Jack into the bushes, accidentally breaking Jack's arm. Jack brought suit against Ike for his damages. Ike's best defense is\n\nA. He thought Jack was the initial aggressor.\nB. Billy had a valid defense if Jack sued him.\nC. The force Ike used was not excessive.\nD. He had no intention of injuring Jack, only to stop his beating of Billy.\n"

He had no intention of injuring Jack, only to stop his beating of Billy.\n\nThis option directly addresses the legal defense Ike can use, which is based on the principle of \"innocent until proven guilty.\" Ike's actions were justified as he believed Jack was the aggressor and had the intention to harm Billy. The fact that Ike accidentally broke Jack's arm does not negate his intention to stop the beating. Therefore, Ike's defense is valid under the legal framework of \"innocent until proven guilty.\""
