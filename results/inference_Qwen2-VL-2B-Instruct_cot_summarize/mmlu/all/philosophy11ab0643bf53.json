We often find ourselves in situations where our actions have unintended consequences, and these consequences can be seen as \"luck\" rather than our own responsibility. This idea is encapsulated in the concept of \"moral luck,\" which refers to the idea that our actions are not entirely under our control and can have unintended consequences."
