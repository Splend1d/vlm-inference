The rotation periods are 360, 450, and 540 days.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of each number:\n\n- \\(360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\\)\n- \\(450 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\\)\n- \\(540 = 2^2 \\times 3^3\\)\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers. So, the LCM is:\n\n- \\(2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^2 = 8 \\times 27 \\times 25 = 2160\\)\n\nTherefore, the minimum positive number of days before the three planets are all in the exact same locations again is 2160 days.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 1200"
