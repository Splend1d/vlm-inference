No, because state courts must abstain in cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue.\n\nThis option aligns with the principle that federal law must be interpreted and applied by a federal court, unless there is a clear conflict with state law or a federal court has already decided the federal issue. In this case, the plaintiff's cause of action is based on a federal statute, which has not yet been interpreted by any federal court. Therefore, the state court cannot hear the case until a federal court has decided the federal issue.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nA. No, because cases arising under federal law must be decided in federal court.\n- This option is incorrect because the plaintiff's case is based on a federal statute, which is subject to federal interpretation and application. The state court can hear the case if the federal court has not yet decided the federal issue.\n\nC. Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n- This option is incorrect because the plaintiff's case is based on a federal statute, which is subject to federal interpretation and application. The state court cannot hear the case if the federal court has not yet decided the federal issue.\n\nD. Yes, because the parties cannot proceed in federal court since there is no diversity of citizenship.\n- This option is incorrect because the plaintiff and defendant reside in the same state, which means there is no diversity of citizenship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
