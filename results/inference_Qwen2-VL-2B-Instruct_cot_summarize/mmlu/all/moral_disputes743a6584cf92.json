The context revolves around the relationship between liberal egalitarianism and immigration policies, specifically focusing on the idea of openness toward immigrants and refugees.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. **Liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees.**\n   - This option suggests that liberal egalitarianism should always advocate for more openness in immigration policies. However, the passage does not provide enough information to conclude that liberal egalitarianism should always advocate for more openness. The passage discusses the idea of openness but does not provide a clear direction or conclusion about the frequency of this advocacy.\n\nB. **Liberal egalitarianism, contrary to appearances, entails that only closed border immigration policies are acceptable.**\n   - This option suggests that liberal egalitarianism is inconsistent with the idea of closed border immigration policies. The passage does not provide enough information to conclude that liberal egalitarianism is inconsistent with closed border policies. The passage discusses the idea of openness but does not provide a clear direction or conclusion about the relationship between liberal egalitarianism and closed border policies.\n\nC. **Egalitarianism is founded on sentiments of envy and is therefore unjustified.**\n   - This option suggests that egalitarianism is unjustified because it is founded on sentiments of envy. The passage does not provide enough information to conclude that egalitarianism is unjustified based on envy. The passage discusses the idea of openness but does not provide a clear direction or conclusion about the relationship between egalitarianism and envy.\n\nD. **Liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism do not succeed.**\n   - This option suggests that liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism are not effective. The passage does not provide enough information to conclude that liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism are not effective. The passage discusses the idea of openness but does not provide a clear direction or conclusion about the effectiveness of liberal egalitarian objections.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each option, it is clear that none of the options directly align with the main conclusion of the passage. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the options align with the main conclusion of the passage.**"
