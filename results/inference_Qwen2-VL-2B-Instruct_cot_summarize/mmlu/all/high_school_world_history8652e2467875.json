Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage?\n\nA. British sale of opium in China\nB. British exports of tobacco to China\nC. British introduction of gunpowder to China\nD. British encouragement of heroin use to China\n"

The core of the complaint is about the prohibition of opium in China and the potential transfer of this harmful drug to other countries, particularly the Inner Land (likely referring to India).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **British sale of opium in China**: This option directly addresses the issue of opium being sold in China, which is the core of the complaint. The passage explicitly mentions the prohibition of opium in China and the potential transfer of this drug to other countries, including India.\n\nB. **British exports of tobacco to China**: This option is not directly related to the complaint about opium. The passage does not mention tobacco exports or any connection to the Inner Land.\n\nC. **British introduction of gunpowder to China**: This option is also not directly related to the complaint about opium. The passage does not mention gunpowder or any connection to the Inner Land.\n\nD. **British encouragement of heroin use to China**: This option is not directly related to the complaint about opium. The passage does not mention heroin or any connection to the Inner Land.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the complaint, the most likely prompt for the complaint is:\n\n**A. British sale of opium in China**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nA. British sale of opium in China"
