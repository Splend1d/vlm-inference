The marginal utility of the first slice is 10 utils.\n3. The marginal utility of the second slice is 7 utils.\n4. The marginal utility of the third slice is 3 utils.\n\nThe marginal utility of a good is the additional utility gained by consuming one more unit of the good. The total utility received from consuming pizza is the sum of the marginal utilities of each slice.\n\nLet's calculate the total utility:\n\n- Marginal utility of the first slice: 10 utils\n- Marginal utility of the second slice: 7 utils\n- Marginal utility of the third slice: 3 utils\n\nTotal utility = Marginal utility of the first slice + Marginal utility of the second slice + Marginal utility of the third slice\nTotal utility = 10 utils + 7 utils + 3 utils\nTotal utility = 20 utils\n\nTherefore, the total utility received from eating pizza is 20 utils.\n\nThe correct statement is:\n\nD. The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils."
