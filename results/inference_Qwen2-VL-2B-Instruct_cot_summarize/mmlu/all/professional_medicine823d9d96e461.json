His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?\n\nA. Disruption of vascular basement membranes\nB. Increased hydrostatic pressure\nC. Release of thromboxane\nD. Separation of endothelial junctions\n"
