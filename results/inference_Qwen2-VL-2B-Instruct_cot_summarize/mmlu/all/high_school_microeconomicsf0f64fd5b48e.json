If the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic\n\nIn this scenario, the producer's demand curve is perfectly inelastic, meaning that the producer's price elasticity of demand is zero. This means that the producer's price is not responsive to changes in price. On the other hand, the producer's supply curve is price elastic, meaning that the producer's price elasticity of supply is positive. This means that the producer's price is responsive to changes in price. Therefore, the producer will be the largest burden of the excise tax placed on them, as they will bear the full burden of the tax."
