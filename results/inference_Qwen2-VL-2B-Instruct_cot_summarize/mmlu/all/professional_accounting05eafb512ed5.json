Audit the service organization's controls, assess risk, and prepare the audit plan.\n\nWhen an audit client uses a service organization for several processes, the user auditor should include the following procedures in the audit plan to create the most efficient audit:\n\n1. Audit the service organization's controls: This is the most critical step in the audit process. It involves assessing the effectiveness of the service organization's controls to determine whether they are adequate to prevent material misstatements in the financial statements.\n\n2. Assess risk: This step involves evaluating the risks associated with the service organization's controls and determining the appropriate level of audit evidence needed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatements.\n\n3. Prepare the audit plan: This step involves developing a plan for the audit that includes the procedures to be performed, the expected findings, and the risk of material misstatement that is acceptable.\n\nBy following these procedures, the user auditor can create an audit plan that is most efficient and effective in detecting and preventing material misstatements in the financial statements."
