So, the total time from the television shows is:\n\\[3 \\times 30 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nThe movie was 90 minutes long.\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n\\[90 + 90 = 180 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Sanjay watched television last weekend is 180 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 180."
