Tax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand thus reducing the effect of the tax change on real GDP.\n\nSupply-side economists typically argue that tax cuts can stimulate aggregate supply by encouraging investment and saving, which can lead to increased production and employment. They believe that these changes can lead to a multiplier effect, where each additional dollar of spending generated by a tax cut leads to a larger increase in aggregate demand and output. This is in contrast to demand-side economists, who argue that tax cuts can reduce aggregate demand by reducing disposable income and thus reducing consumption and investment."
