The difference of squares formula is $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$.\n\nGiven $36-9x^2$, we can rewrite it as $3^2 - (3x)^2 = (3+3x)(3-3x)$.\n\nHowever, this is not in the form of the difference of squares, so we need to adjust it. Notice that $36$ is $3^2$ and $9x^2$ is $3^2 - (3x)^2$. So, we can rewrite $36-9x^2$ as $(3^2 - (3x)^2) = (3+3x)(3-3x)$.\n\nBut this is still not in the form of the difference of squares. Let's correct that:\n\n$36-9x^2 = 3^2 - (3x)^2 = (3+3x)(3-3x)$\n\nNow, we can see that $3+3x$ and $3-3x$ are both perfect squares. Specifically, $3+3x = 3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot x + (3x)^2$ and $3-3x = 3^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot x + (3x)^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite $36-9x^2$ as $(3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot x + (3x)^2)(3^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot x + (3x)^2)$, which simplifies to $(3+3x)(3-3x)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct factorization is:\n\nA.
