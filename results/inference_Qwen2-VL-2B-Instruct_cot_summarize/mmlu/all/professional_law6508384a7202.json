The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?\n\nA. Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.\nB. Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\nC. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\nD. No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.\n"

To determine whether this law is likely to be held constitutional, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Authority of the State Legislature**: The state legislature has the authority to pass laws that regulate gambling in the state. If the law was expressly authorized by the state legislature, it is likely to be constitutional.\n\n2. **Interstate Commerce**: The state's law is primarily concerned with the safety of the state's citizens, not with the interstate commerce of gambling. Therefore, the state's law does not violate the interstate commerce clause.\n\n3. **Due Process Rights**: The law does not violate the due process rights of the owners of the casinos. The state has the authority to regulate gambling within its borders, and the law is not based on the owners' state of residence.\n\n4. **Local Interest in Safety**: The state's law is not based on the owners' state of residence but on the safety of the state's citizens. The state's interest in safety outweighs the potential burden of interstate commerce.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.**\n\nThis option aligns with the fact that the state's law is primarily concerned with the safety of the state's citizens, not with the interstate commerce of gambling."
