In this case, the cost of pizza sauce is a fixed cost because it remains constant regardless of the number of pizzas made.\n\n2. **Total Variable Costs**: These are costs that change with the level of production. In this case, the cost of pizza sauce is a variable cost because it increases as the number of pizzas increases.\n\n3. **Marginal Cost**: This is the cost of adding one more unit of a variable cost to the total cost. In this case, the marginal cost of pizza sauce is $0.45.\n\n4. **Total Costs**: This includes both fixed and variable costs. In this case, the total costs would include the fixed cost of pizza sauce and the variable cost of pizza sauce.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. II and IV only**"
