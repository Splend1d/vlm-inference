This means that Kendall has the authority to bind the partnership, including entering into contracts with third parties. Therefore, the partnership agreement does not prevent Thornton from entering into a long-term service contract with Clark, as long as Thornton has the authority to bind the partnership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the partnership agreement does not prevent Thornton from binding the partnership, as long as he has the authority to do so.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Clark does not have any knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority, which means that the partnership agreement does not prevent Thornton from entering into the contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority prior to entering into a service contract with the partnership, but this obligation does not prevent Thornton from entering into the contract."
