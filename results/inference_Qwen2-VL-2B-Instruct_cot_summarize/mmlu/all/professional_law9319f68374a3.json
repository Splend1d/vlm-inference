The principal gave the assistant all of the materials to set up a table with the principal's cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists and even some order forms with businessperson's logo on them. In addition, the assistant represented to third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf. The assistant negotiated a deal for the businessperson with a third party, which the businessperson refused to honor because he did not like the terms that were negotiated. Will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson?\n\nA. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the third party will likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson, we need to analyze the context and the roles involved.\n\n1. **Nature of the Contract**: The contract in question is likely a business deal negotiated by the businessperson at the conference. The assistant represents the businessperson and acts on his behalf, which means she is authorized to negotiate and execute contracts on his behalf.\n\n2. **Role of the Assistant**: The assistant is an administrative assistant who represents the businessperson at the conference. Her actions are considered official and official business, as she is authorized to negotiate on behalf of the businessperson.\n\n3. **Authority of the Assistant**: The assistant is authorized to negotiate on behalf of the businessperson. This is a standard practice in business settings where an employee is sent to negotiate on behalf of the principal.\n\n4. **Principle of Indicia of Authority**: The furnishing of the materials to the assistant, including cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and order forms with the businessperson's logo, is a common practice to establish the assistant's authority to act on behalf of the principal. This is a standard practice in business settings to ensure that the assistant is acting within the scope of the principal's authority.\n\nGiven these points, the key issue is whether the third party will be able to enforce the contract against the businessperson. The assistant is acting within the authority of the businessperson, and the materials provided to her indicate that she is authorized to negotiate on behalf of the businessperson.\n\n**Option Analysis**:\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal. This is not necessarily correct because the principal is bound to the employee's actions when he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf, but the furnishing of the materials does not necessarily bind the principal to the actions of the assistant.\n- **Option B**: This option suggests that the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf. This is not necessarily correct because the furnishing of the materials does not necessarily bind the principal to the actions of the assistant.\n- **Option C**: This option suggests that people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent. This is not necessarily correct because the furnishing of the materials does not necessarily indicate that the assistant is an authorized agent.\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority. This is not necessarily correct because the furnishing of the materials does not necessarily indicate that the assistant is an authorized agent.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.**"
