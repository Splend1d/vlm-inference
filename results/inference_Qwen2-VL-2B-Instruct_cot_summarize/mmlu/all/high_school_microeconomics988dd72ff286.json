They are typically convex to the origin because the opportunity cost of producing one good increases as more of that good is produced. This is because the opportunity cost of producing one good is the amount of the other good that must be given up to produce one more unit of the first good. As a result, the PPF is convex to the origin, meaning that it curves upwards as we move from left to right."
