Mill believed that freedom of speech is a fundamental human right that is essential for the development of a healthy society. He argued that the right to freedom of speech is not absolute, but rather subject to certain limitations, such as the need to avoid inciting violence or promoting harmful ideas. Therefore, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute and can be limited by the government in certain circumstances."
