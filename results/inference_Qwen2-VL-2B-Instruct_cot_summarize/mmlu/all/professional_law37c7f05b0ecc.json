The judge then informed the prosecuting attorney of the man's comment. After trial is reconvened, the prosecutor calls the judge as a witness to testify to what he heard the defendant tell his attorney. Upon objection by defendant's attorney, may the judge be called as a witness?\n\nA. No, because the man's statement was a confidential communication and protected under the attorney-client privilege.\nB. No, because a judge may not testify in a matter over which he or she is presiding.\nC. Yes, because a judge has a duty to disclose incriminating evidence to the prosecution.\nD.

Yes, because the man's statement was not a confidential communication.\n\nThe judge's statement was overheard during a recess in the courtroom, which is a public setting where the judge is presiding over the trial. The judge's statement was not a confidential communication, as it was made during a public conversation and not in a private setting. Therefore, the judge can be called as a witness to testify to what he heard the defendant tell his attorney.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because the man's statement was a confidential communication and protected under the attorney-client privilege.\n   - This is not correct because the statement was not a confidential communication, and the privilege does not apply here.\n\nB. No, because a judge may not testify in a matter over which he or she is presiding.\n   - This is not correct because the judge was not presiding over the matter when the statement was made.\n\nC. Yes, because a judge has a duty to disclose incriminating evidence to the prosecution.\n   - This is not correct because the judge's statement was not incriminating evidence, and the duty to disclose is not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
