Current year's depreciation expense was erroneously understated.\n\nExplanation: If management is questioned about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year, it is likely that the current year's depreciation expense was erroneously understated. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as an error in the depreciation calculation, an incorrect estimate of the remaining useful life of the plant assets, or a misclassification of the asset. The auditor would need to investigate these potential explanations to determine the cause of the error."
