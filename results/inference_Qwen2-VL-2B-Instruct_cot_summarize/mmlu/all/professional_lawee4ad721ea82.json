The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme: the defendant would be calling the victim from a public phone booth on a particular street corner on a certain date and time to make the extortionist demand. Without notif'ing the telephone company or seeking a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. At the time on the date specified by the informant, the defendant phoned the victim from the telephone booth and said, \"You better pay me $5,000 by next week or I'll kill you and your family. \" The defendant provided additional details about how and where to make the payoff. Based on the taped conversation, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with extortion. Prior to trial, the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation from evidence. The defense motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.\nB. granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.\nC. denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.\nD. denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.\n"

This is a violation of the Fourth Amendment's requirement that searches and seizures must be conducted in accordance with the law and without unreasonable search and seizure.\n   - This violation of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement is a fundamental constitutional issue that must be addressed by the court.\n\n2. **The Police Had Probable Cause Based on the Information Supplied by the Informant:**\n   - The police had probable cause to believe that the defendant was extorting money from the victim based on the informant's information. This is a legitimate basis for the police to install the eavesdropping device without a warrant.\n\n3. **The Police Did Not Secure a Warrant Before Installing the Eavesdropping Device:**\n   - The police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device. This is a violation of the Fourth Amendment's requirement that searches and seizures must be conducted in accordance with the law and without unreasonable search and seizure.\n   - This violation of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement is a fundamental constitutional issue that must be addressed by the court.\n\nGiven these points, the police's actions were not only illegal but also had a substantial impact on the defendant's constitutional rights. Therefore, the court should deny the defendant's motion to exclude the taped conversation from evidence.\n\n**Final Answer: D. denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.**"
