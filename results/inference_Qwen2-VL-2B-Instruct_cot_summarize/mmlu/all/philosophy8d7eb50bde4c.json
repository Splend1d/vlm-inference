While this might be true, it does not directly address the core issue of the statement about objective principles for the good life.\n\nB. **Appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.**\n   - This option implies that appearances are the only reliable source of knowledge about reality. However, Socrates' statement does not support this idea. Instead, it suggests that appearances differ from reality, and that there are objective principles for the good life.\n\nC. **The distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth.**\n   - This option aligns with Socrates' statement. It suggests that the distinction between appearances and reality is a fundamental aspect of the dialectical process, which is essential for discovering truth. This supports the idea that there are objective principles for the good life.\n\nD. **There are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.**\n   - This option directly supports the statement by Socrates. It aligns with the idea that there are objective principles that are necessary for the good life, which is the core of the statement.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the one that best supports the given statement is:\n\n**D. There are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.**"
