Nancy has the choice to spend one hour studying, mowing the lawn, or babysitting her niece.\n2. Nancy has chosen to spend one hour studying.\n3. The wage for studying is $6.\n4. The wage for mowing the lawn is $6.\n5. The wage for babysitting is $8.\n\nGiven that Nancy has chosen to study, we need to compare the benefit of studying to the opportunity cost of the time spent studying.\n\n- The benefit of studying is $6.\n- The opportunity cost of studying is the wage for mowing the lawn, which is $6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n- This is not necessarily true. The benefit of studying ($6) is greater than the opportunity cost of $8, but it is not necessarily greater than $8.\n\nB. The opportunity cost of studying is $14, which is less than the benefit received from studying.\n- This is not necessarily true. The opportunity cost of studying ($6) is less than the benefit received from studying ($6), but it is not necessarily less than $14.\n\nC. Nancy is indifferent to both studying and mowing the lawn.\n- This is not necessarily true. Nancy has chosen to study, which means she has chosen to spend her time studying, not mowing the lawn.\n\nD. Nancy's behavior is irrational, since babysitting was clearly superior to all other options.\n- This is not necessarily true. Nancy has chosen to study, which is a rational choice given the available options and the wage rates.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8."
