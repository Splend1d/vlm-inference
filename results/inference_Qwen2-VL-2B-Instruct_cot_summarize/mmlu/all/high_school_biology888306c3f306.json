Some mutations produce alleles that are recessive and may not be expressed.\nB. Some undesirable phenotypic traits may be prevented from reproducing.\nC. Some mutations cause such drastic phenotypic changes that they are removed from the gene pool.\nD. The predictable rate of mutation results in ongoing variability in a gene pool.\n"

Some mutations produce alleles that are recessive and may not be expressed.\n\nMutations that produce alleles that are recessive and may not be expressed are less likely to be expressed in the offspring, which can lead to a lower frequency of mutations. However, this does not necessarily mean that the frequency of mutation is low. The other options (B, C, and D) are more likely reasons for the low frequency of mutations."
