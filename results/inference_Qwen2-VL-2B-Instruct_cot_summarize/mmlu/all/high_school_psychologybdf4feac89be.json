Initial determination of the absolute threshold and the variation of the difference threshold.\n\nA just-noticeable difference (JND) is the smallest difference that can be detected by the human senses. It depends on the initial determination of the absolute threshold and the variation of the difference threshold. The absolute threshold is the minimum intensity of a stimulus that can be detected, while the difference threshold is the smallest difference between two stimuli that can be detected. The variation of the difference threshold refers to the range of differences that can be detected with a certain level of sensitivity."
