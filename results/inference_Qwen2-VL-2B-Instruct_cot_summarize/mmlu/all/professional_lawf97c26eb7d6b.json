The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?\n\nA. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.\nB. Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\nC. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.\nD. Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.\n"

These records are regularly kept and are part of the business's regular operations.\n\n2. **Nature of the Hearsay Rule**: The hearsay rule generally applies to oral statements made by a person who is not present at the time of the event. However, in this case, the records are not oral statements but rather regular business records kept by the bank.\n\n3. **Nature of the Evidence**: The records are not hearsay because they are not statements made by a person who is not present at the time of the event. They are simply records of transactions that have occurred.\n\n4. **Nature of the Court's Discretion**: The court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business. This is because the records are part of the business's regular operations and are kept for the purpose of maintaining records and accounting.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity, based on the nature of the evidence and the court's discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.\n\n**Final Answer: A. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.**"
