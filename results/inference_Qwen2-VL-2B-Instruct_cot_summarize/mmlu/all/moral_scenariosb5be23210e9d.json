In Scenario 1, the character drank four glasses of wine before driving, which is generally considered a morally wrong action because it can lead to impaired driving, which is a serious traffic violation. In Scenario 2, the character fed a bird with a loaf of bread, which is also generally considered morally wrong because it is cruel and inhumane to feed animals in this manner."
