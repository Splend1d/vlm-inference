However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\nB. Too low, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\nC. Too high, because of undercoverage bias.\nD. Too high, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\n"

If the sample is not representative of the population, the average number of children in single-family homes might be lower than the actual average.\n\n2. **Convenience Sampling Bias**: This occurs when the sample is selected based on convenience rather than random selection. If the sample is not randomly selected, the average number of children might be higher than the actual average.\n\nGiven that the researcher picked a simple random sample of 50 homes and then instructed the interviewer to keep trying until contact was made with someone in a total of 50 homes, this method is likely to be representative of the population. However, the fact that the interviewer was unable to contact anyone in 8 of these homes suggests that there might be undercoverage bias.\n\nTherefore, the estimate of 1.73 children per home is probably too low because it is based on a sample that is not representative of the population, which is likely to have a lower average number of children.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias."
