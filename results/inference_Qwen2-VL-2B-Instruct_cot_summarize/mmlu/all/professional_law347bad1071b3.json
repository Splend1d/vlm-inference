Following the killings, the police issued an \"all-points-bulletin\" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will\n\nA. succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.\nB. succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.\nC. not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.\nD. not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.\n"

The key point here is whether the false arrest constitutes assault, and the answer hinges on the security guard's intent and the circumstances surrounding the arrest.\n\n1. **Option A: Success if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.**\n   - This option suggests that the man would succeed if he saw the security guard pointing a gun at him. However, the scenario does not provide any information about the security guard's intent or the circumstances surrounding the arrest. The man's claim of assault would depend on the security guard's intent and the circumstances of the arrest, not just the man's perception of the guard's actions.\n\n2. **Option B: Success if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.**\n   - This option suggests that the man would succeed if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. The scenario does not provide any information about the security guard's belief or the circumstances surrounding the arrest. The man's claim of assault would depend on the security guard's intent and the circumstances of the arrest, not just the man's perception of the guard's actions.\n\n3. **Option C: Not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.**\n   - This option suggests that the man would not succeed if the security guard did not intend to injure him. The scenario does not provide any information about the security guard's intent or the circumstances surrounding the arrest. The man's claim of assault would depend on the security guard's intent and the circumstances of the arrest, not just the man's perception of the guard's actions.\n\n4. **Option D: Not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.**\n   - This option suggests that the man would not succeed if he did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act. The scenario does not provide any information about the security guard's actions or the circumstances surrounding the arrest. The man's claim of assault would depend on the security guard's intent and the circumstances of the arrest, not just the man's perception of the guard's actions.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**Option B: Success if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.**\n\nThis option aligns with the scenario where the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable, which could lead to a false arrest and subsequent injury to the suspect."
