Marcus Garvey, the founder of the Black National Congress, argued that the cry for the Africans of Africa should be raised, just as the cry for the Canadians, Americans, English, French, and Germans has been raised. This position suggests a call for integration and recognition of African Americans within American society, which is a central theme of the ongoing debate about the place of African Americans in American society. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society."
