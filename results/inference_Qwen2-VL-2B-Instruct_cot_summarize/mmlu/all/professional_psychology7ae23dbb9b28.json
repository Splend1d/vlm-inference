Burnout is a state of exhaustion and despair that occurs when an individual feels overwhelmed by the demands of their job or life. Lack of control and insufficient reward are two factors that can increase the likelihood of burnout. When an individual feels that they have little control over their work or life, they may become overwhelmed and feel like they are constantly being pulled in different directions. Additionally, when an individual does not receive the rewards they deserve, they may become dissatisfied and feel like they are not living up to their potential."
