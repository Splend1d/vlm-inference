Skinner both proposed theories about how children acquire language, but their theories differ in their emphasis on the role of the language acquisition device. Chomsky's theory emphasizes the importance of innate linguistic structures and the role of the language acquisition device, while Skinner's theory focuses on the role of environmental factors and the role of the child's cognitive development in language acquisition."
