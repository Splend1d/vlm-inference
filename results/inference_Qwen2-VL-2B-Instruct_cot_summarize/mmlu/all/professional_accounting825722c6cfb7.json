Smith has calculated that automation would result in savings of $45,000 a year due to reduced scrap and $65,000 a year due to reduced labor costs. The machine has a useful life of 4 years and falls in the 3-year property class for MACRS depreciation purposes. The estimated final salvage value of the machine is $120,000. The firm's marginal tax rate is 34 percent. The incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is closest to\n\nA. $280,000.00\nB. $380,000.00\nC. $480,000.00\nD. $580,000.00\n"

Initial Investment:\n   - Purchase price of the machine: $475,000\n   - Shipping and installation cost: $5,000\n   - Total initial investment: $475,000 + $5,000 = $475,005\n\n2. Savings from Automation:\n   - Savings due to reduced scrap: $45,000\n   - Savings due to reduced labor costs: $65,000\n   - Total savings from automation: $45,000 + $65,000 = $110,000\n\n3. Salvage Value:\n   - Final salvage value: $120,000\n\n4. Incremental Cash Outflow at Time Period 0:\n   - Total initial investment: $475,005\n   - Savings from automation: $110,000\n   - Salvage value: $120,000\n   - Incremental cash outflow at time period 0: $475,005 + $110,000 + $120,000 = $705,005\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is:\n\nC. $480,000.00"
