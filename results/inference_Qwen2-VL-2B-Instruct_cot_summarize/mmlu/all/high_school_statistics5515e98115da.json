Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling.\n\nStratified random sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This method can help reduce bias by ensuring that the sample is representative of the population as a whole, rather than being biased towards or against any particular subgroup. Simple random sampling, on the other hand, does not take into account any subgroup differences and can lead to biased results if the sample is not representative of the population."
