Conventional constructivists view constructivism as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, enabling both to benefit from the insights of the other. Conversely, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology.\nB. Critical constructivism regards the strength of social constructivism to be its ability to bridge rationalist and reflectivity approaches. Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis.\nC. Conventional constructivism refers to the earlier works of social constructivist theorists that are characterised by a rejection of positivist methodology. Critical constructivists challenge these theories, embracing positivist methodologies in their work.\nD. Social constructivism is best understood as a uniform approach to the construction of social identities and security; although distinctions exist within the field, these are not easily defined as distinctive separate approaches.\n"

Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis.\n\nSocial constructivism is a theory that emphasizes the role of social construction in the development of knowledge and understanding. It suggests that knowledge is constructed through social interaction and that individuals are active participants in the construction of their own knowledge. Critical constructivism, on the other hand, argues that social constructivism is not a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches but rather a regression to positivist methodologies, which are based on the assumption that knowledge is objective and can be verified through empirical evidence."
