Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube\n\nThis pathway involves the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in the mesophyll cells through companion cells, which are specialized cells that transport sugars and other substances. The sucrose then moves through the phloem parenchyma, which is a type of tissue that contains sieve tubes, which are specialized for the transport of sugars. The sucrose then moves through the fibers, which are specialized for the transport of water and other substances, and finally into the sieve tubes, which are specialized for the transport of sugars."
