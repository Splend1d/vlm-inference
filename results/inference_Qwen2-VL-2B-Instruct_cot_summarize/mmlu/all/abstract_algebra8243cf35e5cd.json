There exist non-abelian groups of order \\(p^2\\) for any prime \\(p\\), such as the dihedral group \\(D_8\\), which has order \\(8 = 2^3\\) and is non-abelian.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The statement that for a fixed prime \\(p\\), a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of a group \\(G\\) is normal if and only if it is the only Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\) is a well-known fact in group theory. This is a consequence of the Sylow theorems, which state that the number of Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups of a group \\(G\\) is congruent to 1 modulo \\(p\\) and is equal to the index of the Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup in \\(G\\). If the Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup is the only one, then it must be normal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
