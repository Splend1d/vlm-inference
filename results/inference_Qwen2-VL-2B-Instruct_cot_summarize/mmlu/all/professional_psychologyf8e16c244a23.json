Let's analyze each option in the context of stress inoculation training:\n\nA. **PRACTICE\u2192 applies learning to real or imagines situations done on a gradual basis**: This is correct. Stress inoculation training involves gradually applying learned skills to real-life situations.\n\nB. **SKILLS ACQUISITION\u2192 learning relaxation, self-statements, escape routes not necessary with rehearsing them**: This is incorrect. Stress inoculation training does not require rehearsal of relaxation, self-statements, or escape routes; it focuses on learning and applying these skills.\n\nC. **COGNITION PREPARATION\u2192 education on how faulty cognitions prevent adaptive coping**: This is correct. Stress inoculation training involves preparing the therapist to recognize and understand faulty cognitions that prevent adaptive coping.\n\nD. **SKILLS ACQUISITION\u2192 learning and rehearsing new skills relaxation, self-statements, escape routes**: This is correct. Stress inoculation training involves learning and rehearsing new skills, including relaxation, self-statements, and escape routes.\n\nGiven the analysis, the step that is incorrectly defined by a young inexperienced therapist is:\n\n**B. SKILLS ACQUISITION\u2192 learning relaxation, self-statements, escape routes not necessary with rehearsing them**.\n\nFinal answer: B."
