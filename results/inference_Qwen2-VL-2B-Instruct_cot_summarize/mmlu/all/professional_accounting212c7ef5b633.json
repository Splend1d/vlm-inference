To achieve this, the auditor should trace transactions from the cash receipts journal to the customer's purchase orders. This is because the cash receipts journal records the receipt of cash from customers, while the customer's purchase orders are the original documents that indicate the amount of sales that have been made. By tracing the cash receipts journal to the customer's purchase orders, the auditor can identify any discrepancies or errors that may indicate an overstatement of sales. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
