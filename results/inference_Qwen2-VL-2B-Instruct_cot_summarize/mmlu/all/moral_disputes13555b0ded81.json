Around one quarter of all human deaths.\n This option is consistent with Pogge's statement, as it suggests that poverty-related deaths account for one quarter of all human deaths.\n\nB. Around one third of all human deaths. This option is not consistent with Pogge's statement, as it suggests that poverty-related deaths account for one third of all human deaths, which is not supported by the information given.\n\nC. Around one half of all human deaths. This option is not consistent with Pogge's statement, as it suggests that poverty-related deaths account for one half of all human deaths, which is not supported by the information given.\n\nD. None of the above. This option is not consistent with Pogge's statement, as it suggests that poverty-related deaths do not account for any part of all human deaths, which is not supported by the information given.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
