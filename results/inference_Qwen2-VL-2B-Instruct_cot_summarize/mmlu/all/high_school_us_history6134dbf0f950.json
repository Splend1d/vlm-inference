He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nA. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\nC. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n"

                    "text": "To determine how President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation altered the course of the Civil War, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Lincoln's Position on Slavery**: Lincoln was strongly anti-slavery, but he was not an abolitionist or a Radical Republican and never claimed to be one. He made a sharp distinction between his personal wish and his official duties.\n\n2. **Emancipation Proclamation**: Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, which declared that all slaves in the Confederate states would be free. This proclamation was a significant step in the war effort, as it directly challenged the Confederacy's claim to the right to own slaves.\n\n3. **Impact on the Confederacy**: The Emancipation Proclamation had a profound impact on the Confederacy. It directly challenged the Confederacy's justification for its war effort, as it made it clear that the Confederacy was not fighting for the preservation of the Union but for the continuation of slavery.\n\n4. **Resistance from the Confederacy**: The Confederacy's leaders, particularly President Jefferson Davis, vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves. This resistance was a significant factor in the war's outcome.\n\n5. **Scope of the War**: The Emancipation Proclamation did not cause the war to grow in scope. It was a direct challenge to the Confederacy's justification for its war effort and had a significant impact on the war's direction.\n\n6. **Aims of the United States**: The Emancipation Proclamation did not change the war aims of the United States. The war's primary aim was to preserve the Union, and the Emancipation Proclamation did not alter this goal.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union."
