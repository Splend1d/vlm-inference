This is because the correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. In this case, the two variables are the number of hours students studied for the first and second exams. Since the number of hours studied for the second exam is a multiple of the number of hours studied for the first exam (10 hours), the correlation coefficient will be 0, indicating no linear relationship between the two variables. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
