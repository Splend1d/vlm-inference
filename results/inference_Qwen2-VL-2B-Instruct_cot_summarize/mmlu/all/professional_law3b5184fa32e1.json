The deed states that if the property is used for church purposes, it will pass to the children of the sister who reach the age of 25. This means that the property will pass to the sister's children if the property is used for church purposes.\n\nGiven the timeline of events:\n1. The deed was conveyed in 1960.\n2. The sister was single at the time of the conveyance.\n3. The sister married and had two sons.\n4. One son died in an automobile accident.\n5. Three years after the son's death, the sister had a daughter.\n\nThe deed states that if the property is used for church purposes, it will pass to the children of the sister who reach the age of 25. Therefore, the sister's children (the son and the daughter) will inherit the property if it is used for church purposes.\n\nSince the deed specifies that the property will pass to the children of the sister who reach the age of 25, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born during her lifetime."
