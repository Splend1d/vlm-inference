This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves calling emergency services to help someone in need, which is a responsible and ethical response. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) pushes their friend off the top of the waterfall. This action is also generally considered morally wrong, as it involves a reckless and dangerous behavior that can cause harm to the friend and potentially result in serious injury or death."
