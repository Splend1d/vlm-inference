It does not directly address the goals of child misbehavior.\n\nB. **Adler\u2019s individual psychology**: Adler's theory emphasizes the importance of the individual's personality and the environment in shaping behavior. It does not specifically address the goals of child misbehavior.\n\nC. **Perls\u2019s Gestalt therapy**: This therapy is known for its focus on the individual's unconscious and the environment's impact on behavior. It does not directly address the goals of child misbehavior.\n\nD. **Mahler\u2019s object relations theory**: This theory is concerned with the relationship between the individual and their environment, particularly the unconscious and the unconscious mind. It does not directly address the goals of child misbehavior.\n\nGiven the options, none of them directly address the goals of child misbehavior. However, if we consider the context of child misbehavior, it is more aligned with the goals of power and revenge, which are often considered in Adler's individual psychology.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent belief with the four goals of child misbehavior is:\n\n**B.
