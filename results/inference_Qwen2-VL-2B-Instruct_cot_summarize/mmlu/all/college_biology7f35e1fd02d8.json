                    "text": "To determine the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny from the cross between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant (ddww), we need to consider the dominance and interaction of the alleles involved.\n\n1. **Tall Plant (D) Dominance**: The allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d). Therefore, any offspring with the genotype DD will be tall, regardless of the genotype of the parents.\n\n2. **Violet Flower Color (W) Dominance**: The allele for violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the allele for white flower color (w). Therefore, any offspring with the genotype WW will have violet flowers, regardless of the genotype of the parents.\n\nGiven the genotype of the parents:\n- The tall plant (DD) will produce offspring with the genotype DD.\n- The violet flower color (W) will produce offspring with the genotype WW.\n\nSince the tall plant (DD) will produce offspring with the genotype DD, and the violet flower color (W) will produce offspring with the genotype WW, the only offspring that will have both the tall plant and the violet flower color will be the offspring with the genotype DDWW.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny from this cross would be:\n- 1 tall violet (DDWW)\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. All tall violet"
