Which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\nB. The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.\nC. Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\nD. A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\n"

In this case, the researcher obtained a simple random sample of 30 adults, which is a good start. However, the fact that all but two of the adults agree to participate in the survey suggests that there might be selection bias. This means that the sample may not be truly representative of the entire adult population, as those who agree to participate might be more likely to have strong opinions or be more interested in the topic of the survey. Therefore, the conclusion that selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey is correct."
