The expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring can be predicted based on the inheritance pattern of the mutation.\n\nIn MERRF, the mutation occurs in the mtDNA, which is inherited from the mother. Therefore, the offspring will inherit the affected mtDNA from their mother. If the mother is affected, the offspring will also be affected.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected"
