The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A tenancy at will was created.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\nD. The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n"

A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\n\nIn a leasehold agreement, the lease term is typically specified in years, and the parties agree to renew the lease at the end of the term. In this case, the lease term is specified as three years, which means that the lease is a periodic tenancy from year-to-year. The tenant is leasing the first floor of the building for three years, and the landlord is agreeing to renew the lease at the end of each year."
