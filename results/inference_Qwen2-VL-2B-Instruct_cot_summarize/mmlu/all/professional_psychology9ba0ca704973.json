The application of a partial reinforcement schedule.\n\nIn the context of learned helplessness research, the idea is that when individuals are given solvable problems, they are given the opportunity to succeed, which leads to a change in their attribution from the failure of the unsolvable problems to the ability to solve problems. This shift in attribution leads to a change in their locus of control from internal to external, which in turn leads to a reduction in the sense of helplessness."
