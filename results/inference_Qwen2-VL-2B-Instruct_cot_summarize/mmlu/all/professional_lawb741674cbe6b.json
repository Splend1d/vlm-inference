Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.\n\nThe duty to assist others arises from the principle of \"duty to protect\" and the legal obligation to act in one's own best interest. When a shopper sees that another person is in danger, it is generally considered a duty to take action to protect the other person, even if it might involve putting oneself at risk. This is a common legal principle known as the \"duty to protect\" or \"duty to assist\" doctrine.\n\nIn summary, the shopper has a duty to take action to protect the second shopper from injury, even if it involves putting herself at risk."
