The multiplier effect is the increase in aggregate demand that results from an increase in one component of aggregate demand, such as spending or tax collections.\n\nGiven that the government increases spending by $12 million and raises tax collections by the same amount, the total increase in aggregate demand is $12 million + $12 million = $24 million.\n\nThe multiplier effect is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{Multiplier}} \\]\n\nLet's denote the multiplier as \\( M \\). Then:\n\\[ 24 = \\frac{1}{1 - M} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( M \\):\n\\[ 1 - M = \\frac{1}{24} \\]\n\\[ 1 - M = \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\\[ M = 1 - \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{7}{8} \\]\n\nThis means that for every $1 increase in aggregate demand, the multiplier effect leads to an additional $7/8 or $0.875 increase in aggregate demand. Since the government's spending and tax collection increases are both $12 million, the total increase in aggregate demand is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nTherefore, the overall impact of these moves on real GDP in country Z is:\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} \\times \\text{Increase in aggregate demand} = \\frac{7}{8} \\times 24 = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the overall impact on real GDP is an increase of $14 million, which corresponds to option A. Real GDP will increase by $6 million."
