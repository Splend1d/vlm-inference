When you choose a significance level \u03b1, you're setting the probability of a Type I error to exactly \u03b1.\n\nThis is because a significance level \u03b1 is used to determine the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error) and the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (Type II error). Therefore, the probability of a Type I error is exactly \u03b1."
