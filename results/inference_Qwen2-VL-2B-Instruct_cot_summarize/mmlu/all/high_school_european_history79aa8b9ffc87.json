It was intended to strengthen the military and provide a strong defense against external threats. While it was a necessary measure, it also had the potential to infringe on individual liberties and rights, which could be considered a negative outcome.\n\n2. **Fixing prices and wages**: This measure aimed to stabilize the economy and prevent inflation. It was intended to ensure that workers and farmers had a stable income, which could be beneficial in the short term. However, it could also lead to economic instability and a lack of incentives for innovation and productivity, which could be detrimental in the long term.\n\n3. **Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization**: This was a controversial measure aimed at eradicating the influence of Christianity in France. It was intended to promote a secular state and to strengthen the revolutionary cause. While it was a significant step towards secularization, it could also be seen as a violation of religious freedom and could lead to social unrest and conflict.\n\n4. **Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field**: This measure aimed to reward soldiers for their bravery and dedication to the revolutionary cause. It was intended to strengthen the military and provide a sense of pride and honor for those who served. While it was a positive measure, it could also lead to a culture of military valor and a lack of respect for civilian life, which could be detrimental in the long term.\n\nGiven the context of the information provided, the change that was LEAST beneficial to the defense of France during the radical phase of the revolution is:\n\n**A. The conscription of huge armies**\n\nThis measure was necessary for the revolutionary cause but could also have negative consequences, such as infringing on individual liberties and rights."
