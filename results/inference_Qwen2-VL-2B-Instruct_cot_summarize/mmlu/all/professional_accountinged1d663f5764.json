Specifically, the IRC defines an affiliated group as follows:\n\n1. **Direct Ownership**: Each corporation in the group must own at least 50% of the outstanding voting common stock of the other corporations in the group.\n2. **Control**: Each corporation in the group must have the power to control the other corporations in the group.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n- Rigg Steele and Urco are both accrual-basis calendar-year C corporations.\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 40% of Urco.\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n\nLet's analyze the ownership structure:\n\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 40% of Urco.\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n\nTo determine if Rigg Steele and Urco qualify as an affiliated group, we need to check if Rigg owns at least 50% of the outstanding voting common stock of Steele and Steele owns at least 50% of the outstanding voting common stock of Urco.\n\n1. **Ownership of Steele by Rigg**:\n   - Rigg owns 85% of Steele.\n   - Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n   - Therefore, Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 50% of Urco, which is not 50% of the outstanding voting common stock of Steele.\n\n2. **Ownership of Urco by Rigg**:\n   - Rigg owns 40% of Urco.\n   - Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n   - Therefore, Rigg owns 40% of Urco and 50% of Urco, which is not 50% of the outstanding voting common stock of Urco.\n\nSince Rigg does not own at least 50% of the outstanding voting common stock of Steele and Steele does not own at least 50% of the outstanding voting common stock of Urco, Rigg Steele and Urco do not qualify as an affiliated group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. An affiliated group does not exist."
