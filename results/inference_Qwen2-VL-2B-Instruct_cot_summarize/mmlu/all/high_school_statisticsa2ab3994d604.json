This range is from 0.45 to 0.55.\n- The probability of getting exactly 45% heads is (0.45)^30.\n- The probability of getting exactly 55% heads is (0.55)^30.\n- The probability of getting between 45% and 55% heads is the sum of these two probabilities.\n\nFor the second game:\n- You win if you can throw more than 80% heads. This is 0.80.\n- The probability of getting exactly 80% heads is (0.80)^30.\n- The probability of getting more than 80% heads is 1 minus the probability of getting exactly 80% heads.\n\nLet's calculate these probabilities:\n\nFor the first game:\n- Probability of exactly 45% heads: (0.45)^30 \u2248 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
