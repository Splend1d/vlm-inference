Intangibility, value, variability, inseparability, and a lack of ownership.\n\nServices are characterized by five distinct characteristics:\n\n1. Intangibility: Services are non-physical products that cannot be touched, tasted, or seen. They are intangible and cannot be owned or transferred physically.\n\n2. Value: Services provide a benefit to the customer that cannot be easily quantified or measured. The value of a service is subjective and depends on the customer's perception.\n\n3. Variability: The value of a service can vary depending on the customer's needs and preferences. The same service can be delivered in different ways, with different levels of quality, and to different customers.\n\n4. Inseparability: Services are often delivered in a unique way that cannot be easily separated from the service provider. The service provider and the customer are often closely connected, and the service cannot be easily separated from the service provider.\n\n5. Lack of ownership: Services are often delivered by third parties, such as service providers, and the customer does not own the service. The customer pays for the service, but the service provider owns the physical product or service.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Intangibility, value, variability, inseparability, and a lack of ownership."
