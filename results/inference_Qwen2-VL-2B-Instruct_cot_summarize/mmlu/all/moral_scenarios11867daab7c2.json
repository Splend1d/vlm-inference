This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves deception and exploitation. In Scenario 2, the main character threw their milk on their classmates head to make him cry. This action is also morally wrong, as it involves causing harm to another person without their consent. Both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
