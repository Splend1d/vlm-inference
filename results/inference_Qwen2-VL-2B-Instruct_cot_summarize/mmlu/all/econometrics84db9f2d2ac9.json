A model whose dependent variable has recently exhibited a structural change\n\nA model that is based on financial theory, contains many variables, or is entirely statistical in nature with no room for judgmental modification of forecasts is likely to lead to a relatively high degree of out-of-sample forecast accuracy. This is because a model that is well-suited to the specific characteristics of the data it is forecasting will likely perform better than one that is not. A model that has recently exhibited a structural change, however, may not be as accurate as one that is based on current data and is not subject to any known changes."
