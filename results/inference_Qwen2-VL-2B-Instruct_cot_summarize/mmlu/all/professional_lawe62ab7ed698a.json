While the party was in progress, a few teenagers from the neighborhood vandalized some of the cars parked outside the house. They broke the headlights and stole the battery from the boyfriend's car. When the party ended, the boyfriend and his girlfriend left the house and got into his car. The boyfriend, who was about to drive his girlfriend home, was unaware of what had happened. He tried to start the car, but it wouldn't turn on. Two police officers, who were parked outside the house, watched the boyfriend as he tried to start the car. They then approached the boyfriend and charged him with attempting to violate a local ordinance making it a misdemeanor to drive at night without headlights. The boyfriend's best defense to the charge is\n\nA. factual impossibility.\nB. mistake of fact.\nC. entrapment.\nD. no requisite intent.\n"

In legal terms, a requisite intent is the intention to do something that is prohibited by law. In this case, the boyfriend did not have the requisite intent to violate the ordinance because he did not intend to drive at night without headlights. Therefore, he did not have the necessary intent to violate the ordinance, and the charge should be dismissed."
