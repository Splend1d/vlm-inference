The act further prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. Congress claimed that the statute was passed because it might help deter illicit sexual relationships.

The right to privacy includes the right to use contraceptives without government interference, as it is a fundamental aspect of personal autonomy and reproductive freedom. The prohibition on contraceptive devices for married persons is a clear violation of this right, making the statute unconstitutional."
