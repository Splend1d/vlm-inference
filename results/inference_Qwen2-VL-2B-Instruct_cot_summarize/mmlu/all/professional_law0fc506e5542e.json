The woman then drove through a red light and struck a police car driven by a police officer, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's presentation of evidence, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery. The motion for summary judgment should be\n\nA. granted, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.\nB. granted, because the police officer assumed the risk of injury by answering the emergency call.\nC. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.\nD. denied, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n"

It states that a firefighter cannot recover damages from a third party unless the third party was aware of the risk of injury and chose to engage in the activity despite that risk. In this case, the police officer was not a firefighter and was not engaged in any activity that could be considered a \"duty\" or \"risk\" in the context of the firefighter's rule.\n\nThe police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job, and the accident occurred while he was returning from an emergency scene, not while he was on duty. Therefore, the firefighter's rule does not apply to the police officer in this situation."
