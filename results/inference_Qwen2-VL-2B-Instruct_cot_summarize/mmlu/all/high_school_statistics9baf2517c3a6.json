The significance level is 0.05.\n\nThe power of the test is given by the formula:\n\nPower = 1 - (1 - P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true)) / (1 - P(failing to reject H0 when H0 is false))\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nPower = 1 - (1 - 0.05) / (1 - 0.26)\nPower = 1 - 0.95 / 0.74\nPower = 0.05\n\nTherefore, the power of the test is 0.05, which corresponds to option B."
