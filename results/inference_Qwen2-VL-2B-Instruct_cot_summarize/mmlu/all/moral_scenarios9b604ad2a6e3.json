It involves using authority to suppress a group of people who are expressing themselves artistically, which is generally considered a violation of free speech and the right to privacy.\n\nIn scenario 2, pushing the old lady in the wheelchair across the busy highway is also morally wrong. It involves intentionally causing harm to another person, which is a clear violation of the principle of treating others with respect and consideration.\n\nTherefore, the main character in both scenarios does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
