This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail.\n\u2014Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980\nThe problems that Carter faced in 1980 can best be compared to those of which of the following?\n\nA. Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s\nB. Theodore Roosevelt in the 1900s\nC. Warren Harding in the 1920s\nD. Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s\n"

Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s\n\nThe problem Carter faced was the Iran hostage crisis, which was a significant challenge to the United States and the world at large. This crisis involved the kidnapping of 52 Americans by the Iranian government, who demanded the release of 52 Iranian prisoners held in American prisons. Carter's State of the Union Address in 1980 addressed the crisis and outlined the steps the United States would take to address it. This crisis was a significant challenge to the United States and the world at large, and Carter's address provided a framework for addressing it."
