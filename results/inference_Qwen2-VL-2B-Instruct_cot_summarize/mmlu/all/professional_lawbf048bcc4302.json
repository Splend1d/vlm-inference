The statute must prohibit purely secular considerations.\n\nThe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the establishment of religion by the federal government. This means that laws and regulations cannot favor or disfavor any particular religion. The three-pronged test under traditional analysis is used to determine whether a statute or action is free from establishment of religion suspicions. This test includes:\n\n1. It must have a nonspiritual legislative purpose.\n2. The statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\n3. The statute must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion.\n\nTherefore, the statute must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, which is the key requirement for the statute to be free from establishment of religion suspicions."
