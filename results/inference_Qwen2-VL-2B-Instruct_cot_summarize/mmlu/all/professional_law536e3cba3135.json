They bought a house together but the deed went in the man's name alone due to better credit and ability to obtain a mortgage in his name. He worked as a school vice-principal. She gave up her night law school classes to stay home and be a homemaker. She worked as a waitress and paid for all household expenses, food, laundry and other items. He paid for the mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and other expenses. After several years, they became estranged and the man ordered the woman out of the house. She moved out and brought an action to obtain one-half of the home's equity value and a share of the other property and accounts built up in the man's name during the marriage. Which of the following is the best and strongest argument that the woman may assert to obtain a fair share of the property?\n\nA. There is an express contract between them to share the property equally.\nB. He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\nC. She is entitled to damages based on a legal theory of fraudulent conversion.\nD. She is may be remunerated under the federal civil rights laws prohibiting gender discrimination.\n"

He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\n\nThis argument is based on the concept of quasi-contract, which is a legal theory that allows for the recovery of damages when one party has been unjustly enriched by another party's actions. In this case, the man's actions of ordering the woman out of the house and taking control of the property without her consent can be considered unjust enrichment. The woman may argue that the man has been unjustly enriched by the property and that she is entitled to restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory."
