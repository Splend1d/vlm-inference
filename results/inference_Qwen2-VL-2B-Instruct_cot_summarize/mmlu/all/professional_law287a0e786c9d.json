It is an interference with another's right of possession so severe as to warrant defendant to pay full price of chattel.\n\nConversion is a legal term that refers to the unauthorized taking of another's property, usually with the intent to use it for one's own benefit. The intent is to do the act that brings about the interference, which is the taking of the property. The remedy for conversion is recovery of actual damages from harm to the chattel or loss of use. The damage award of fair market value of the chattel is not the remedy for conversion."
