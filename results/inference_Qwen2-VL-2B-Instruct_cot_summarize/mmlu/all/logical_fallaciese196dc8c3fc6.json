It reaches a truthful conclusion.\n\nA disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that consists of two premises and a conclusion. The conclusion is a statement that is either true or false, depending on the truth values of the premises. A disjunctive syllogism is valid if the conclusion is true whenever both premises are true, or false whenever both premises are false. Therefore, the conclusion must be a statement that is either true or false, and it must be a statement that can be either affirmed or denied.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the minor premise can either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent, but it cannot be either of these unless the conclusion is true or false, respectively.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the minor premise can either accept an alternative or reject an alternative, but it cannot be either of these unless the conclusion is true or false, respectively.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a disjunctive syllogism can have one of the premises missing, but it cannot be either of these unless the conclusion is true or false, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
