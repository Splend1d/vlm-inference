A bank cannot lend out all of its deposits.\n\nIn a fractional reserve banking system, banks are required to hold a certain fraction of their deposits as reserves. This means that not all of the bank's deposits can be lent out at any given time. The exact fraction depends on the banking regulations and the specific banking system in question. However, the key point is that banks cannot lend out all of their deposits, as this would violate the principle of fractional reserve banking."
