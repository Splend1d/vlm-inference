The closure of a set A, denoted as cl(A), is the smallest closed set containing A. If A is connected, then cl(A) is also connected. However, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is connected, but its closure is the set of all real numbers, which is not connected.\n\nStatement 2: Every continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) has a fixed point.\nThis statement is true. A continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) has a fixed point if and only if it is injective (one-to-one). This is because a continuous function maps closed intervals to closed intervals, and if it is injective, it must map the interval (0, 1) to itself, which means it must have a fixed point.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. True, False"
