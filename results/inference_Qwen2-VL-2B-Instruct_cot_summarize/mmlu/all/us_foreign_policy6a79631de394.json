None of the above.\n\nIntergovernmental organizations (IGOs) are not ineffective at promoting human rights because they do not merely identify those states who already support human rights. They can gather information about which leaders will abuse their citizens and can constrain abusive leaders. The inability to get enough information about which leaders will abuse their citizens is a common criticism, but it does not necessarily mean that IGOs are ineffective."
