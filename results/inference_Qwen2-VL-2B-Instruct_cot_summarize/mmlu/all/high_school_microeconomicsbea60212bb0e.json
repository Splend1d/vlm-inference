Mostly price competition.\n\nMonopolistic competition is characterized by a market with many firms, each selling a similar product, and a relatively small number of firms that have market power. This results in a situation where firms are mostly price takers, meaning that they are unable to set prices above marginal cost (P > MC). This is in contrast to perfect competition, where firms are price makers and can set prices above marginal cost. Monopolistic competition also involves a mix of product differentiation and price competition, with firms often offering different products or services to attract customers."
