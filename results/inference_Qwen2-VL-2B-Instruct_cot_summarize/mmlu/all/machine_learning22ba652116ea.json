The kernel width\n\nThe kernel width determines the smoothness of the kernel function, which in turn affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. A wider kernel function allows for more flexibility in the model, which can help prevent overfitting, while a narrower kernel function can help prevent underfitting."
