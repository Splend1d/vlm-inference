Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the outcomes listed below followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter?\n\nA. Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West\nB. A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories\nC. Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority\nD. The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory\n"

Lin Zexu's letter is a critique of the opium trade and its impact on China, specifically mentioning that China's exports to foreign countries are not harmful to mankind and that the opium trade should be banned in China. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West**: This option suggests a negative outcome, which is not supported by the letter. The letter does not mention any naval defeat or new trade terms that would be favorable to the West.\n\nB. **A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories**: This option aligns with the letter's message. Lin Zexu explicitly states that China should ban the opium trade, which is a clear indication that the letter supports the idea of a ban.\n\nC. **Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority**: This option is not supported by the letter. The letter does not mention any uprisings or violence directed towards the pro-British Muslim minority.\n\nD. **The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory**: This option is not supported by the letter. The letter does not mention any expulsion of foreigners from Chinese territory.\n\nBased on the analysis, the outcome that followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter is:\n\n**B. A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories**"
