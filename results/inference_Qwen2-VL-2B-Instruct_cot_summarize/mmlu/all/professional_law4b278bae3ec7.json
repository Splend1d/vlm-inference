                    "text": "A retailer agreed to purchase an orchard's total cherry production for a 12-month period. The contract included this provision: \"Terms: Cash upon delivery \u0080\u0094 deliveries to be made at least twice per month.\" The deliveries went as scheduled. At the beginning of the fifth month, the orchard sent notice to the retailer that a load of cherries was ready for pick up. The truck driver, however, forgot to take the retailer's check with him. The orchard turned over the cherries but advised the retailer to pay within three days. The retailer sent the check by mail but it arrived late by two days. The orchard refused to deliver any more cherries. The retailer sued the orchard for breach of the installment contract and demanded the difference in price between the cherries on the open market and what he would have paid under the contract. The orchard claimed that the delayed payment impaired the value of the contract and moved to dismiss. Will the court grant the orchard's motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the agreement called for cash at delivery, which was not done when the driver forgot to deliver the check.\nB. Yes, the failure to make an installment on time was a breach because time is of the essence in all installment agreements.\nC. No, there is always a grace period of ten days for any single payment pertaining to an installment contract.\nD. No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the Uniform Commercial Code.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court will grant the orchard's motion to dismiss, we need to analyze the terms of the installment contract and the circumstances surrounding the delivery of the cherries.\n\n1. **Agreement and Terms:**\n   - The contract specifies that deliveries must be made at least twice per month.\n   - The deliveries were made on time.\n   - The retailer was notified of the availability of cherries and was advised to pay within three days.\n\n2. **Payment Terms:**\n   - The contract calls for cash upon delivery.\n   - The retailer was supposed to pay within three days of receiving the cherries.\n\n3. **Delivery and Payment:**\n   - The cherries were delivered on time.\n   - The retailer was notified of the availability of cherries and was advised to pay within three days.\n   - The retailer sent the check by mail but it arrived two days late.\n\n4. **Impairment of Value:**\n   - The orchard claims that the delay in payment impaired the value of the contract.\n   - The court must determine whether the delay in payment was sufficient to impair the value of the contract.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The contract specifies that deliveries must be made at least twice per month.\n- The deliveries were made on time.\n- The retailer was notified of the availability of cherries and was advised to pay within three days.\n- The retailer sent the check by mail but it arrived two days late.\n\nThe retailer's delay in payment was not due to any breach of the contract. The delay was due to a technical issue with the delivery process, which was not the retailer's fault. The retailer had ample time to pay within the three-day grace period, and the delay in payment did not impair the value of the contract.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe court will NOT grant the orchard's motion to dismiss. The delay in payment was not sufficient to impair the value of the contract under the terms of the contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the Uniform Commercial Code."
