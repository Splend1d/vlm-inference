In this case, the null hypothesis is H0: p= 0.3, and the alternative hypothesis is HA: p> 0.3.\n\nThe test statistic is the sample proportion, which is 0.35. The P-value is the probability of observing a sample proportion as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nThe P-value is calculated using the formula:\n\nP-value = 1 - (1 - P) * (1 - P)\n\nwhere P is the probability of observing a sample proportion as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nIn this case, P = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65. Therefore, the P-value is:\n\nP-value = 1 - (1 - 0.65) * (1 - 0.65) = 1 - 0.35 * 0.35 = 1 - 0.1225 = 0.8775\n\nTherefore, the P-value is approximately 0.8775, which is closest to option D. 0.8554. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D."
