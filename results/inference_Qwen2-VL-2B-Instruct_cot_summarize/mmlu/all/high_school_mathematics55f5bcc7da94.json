The line $x < y$ is the line that separates the upper half of the rectangle from the lower half. The line $x = y$ intersects the line $x < y$ at the point $(1,1)$.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$. The area of the region where $x < y$ is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle formed by the line $x = y$ and the line $x < y$. The triangle has base 2 and height 1, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1$. Therefore, the area of the region where $x < y$ is $6 - 1 = 5$.\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen point $(x,y)$ is in the region where $x < y$ is the ratio of the area of the region where $x < y$ to the area of the rectangle, which is $\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
