This is a clear example of a morally wrong action, as it involves calling emergency services without a genuine emergency, which can lead to unnecessary distress and potential harm to the neighbor. In Scenario 2, the character went to bed after quickly putting a band aid over a small hole in the military submarine interior. This is not a morally wrong action, as it is a practical and necessary step to prevent further damage to the submarine."
