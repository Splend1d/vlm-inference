In recent years, many outside organizations have entered the fairgrounds and distributed literature and paraphernalia to the many thousands of patrons visiting the fair. State fair officials did not endorse any of these organizations but permitted them to disseminate their materials throughout the fairgrounds without charge. Lately, however, many families attending the fair have complained about being harassed by canvassers from these various organizations. In an effort to protect the safety and welfare of the persons visiting the fair, the state legislature enacted a law prohibiting anyone from selling or distributing materials at the state fair. This new statute provided, however, that groups could pay a $50 license fee and distribute their literature from enclosed booths. These booths would be set up along the entrance to the fairgrounds and rented to anyone wishing to sell or distribute materials or soliciting money during the fair. The first year that the statute went into effect, approximately 40 groups rented booth space. There were various organizations paying the $50 license fee. A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures. The scientists were unwilling to pay the $50 license fee and instituted suit in state court seeking a court order permitting them to distribute literature anywhere in the fairgrounds area. Which of the following is the strongest argument insupport of the constitutionality of the statute?\n\nA. The statute applies to the limited area of the state-owned fairgrounds, and does not discriminate among the various organizations by way of their political, religious, or commercial viewpoints.\nB. The statute applies to representatives of popular organizations, as well as to representatives of unpopular organizations, and is a democratic expression of the will of the people because it was adopted by the state legislature.\nC. The statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of persons using a state facility, and does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints since there is an alternative means by which these organizations can reach their audience.\nD. The statute protects the patrons of a public facility against unwanted invasions of their privacy by restricting the solicitation activities of those organizations that the patrons do not support.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which argument is the strongest support for the constitutionality of the statute, we need to analyze the context and the purpose of the statute. The statute prohibits the sale and distribution of materials at the state fair, but allows groups to pay a license fee and distribute literature from enclosed booths. The scientists' suit seeks to challenge this prohibition, arguing that the statute is unconstitutional because it discriminates against them based on their political, religious, or commercial viewpoints.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The statute applies to the limited area of the state-owned fairgrounds, and does not discriminate among the various organizations by way of their political, religious, or commercial viewpoints.**\n   - This option suggests that the statute is neutral and does not discriminate based on the viewpoints of the organizations. However, it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute as it pertains to the fairgrounds and the fairgoers.\n\nB. **The statute applies to representatives of popular organizations, as well as to representatives of unpopular organizations, and is a democratic expression of the will of the people because it was adopted by the state legislature.**\n   - This option suggests that the statute is democratic and reflects the will of the people, but it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute as it pertains to the fairgrounds and the fairgoers.\n\nC. **The statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of persons using a state facility, and does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints since there is an alternative means by which these organizations can reach their audience.**\n   - This option suggests that the statute is necessary to protect the safety and welfare of fairgoers and does not discriminate based on viewpoints. However, it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute as it pertains to the fairgrounds and the fairgoers.\n\nD. **The statute protects the patrons of a public facility against unwanted invasions of their privacy by restricting the solicitation activities of those organizations that the patrons do not support.**\n   - This option directly addresses the constitutionality of the statute as it pertains to the fairgrounds and the fairgoers. It suggests that the statute protects fairgoers from unwanted solicitation activities by organizations that the patrons do not support, thereby ensuring their privacy and safety.\n\nGiven the context and the purpose of the statute, the strongest argument in support of its constitutionality is:\n\n**D. The statute protects the patrons of a public facility against unwanted invasions of their privacy by restricting the solicitation activities of those organizations that the patrons do not support.**\n\nFinal answer: D"
