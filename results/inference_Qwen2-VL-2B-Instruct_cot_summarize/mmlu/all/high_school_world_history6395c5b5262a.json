Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nPublication of the first passage was followed by which of the political outcomes described below?\n\nA. French women, like Jews, Protestants, and freed blacks, attained political equality after only a short delay.\nB. French women quickly gained the right to vote, but not to hold political office.\nC. French women found their status even lower than it had been before the French Revolution.\nD. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.\n"

                    "text": "The passage describes the experiences of Olympe de Gouges, a French revolutionary, and Halima Ghomri, an Algerian woman who lived during the Algerian War of Independence. The passage highlights the challenges faced by women during this time, including poverty, lack of education, and the continued oppression of women in society.\n\nTo determine the political outcome described in the passage, we need to analyze the options provided:\n\nA. French women, like Jews, Protestants, and freed blacks, attained political equality after only a short delay.\n- This option suggests that women, including French women, gained political equality quickly after the French Revolution. However, the passage does not mention any specific timeline or rapid progress for women's political rights.\n\nB. French women quickly gained the right to vote, but not to hold political office.\n- This option suggests that women gained the right to vote but not the right to hold political office. The passage does not provide information about women's political rights in terms of voting rights alone.\n\nC. French women found their status even lower than it had been before the French Revolution.\n- This option suggests that women's status remained the same after the French Revolution. The passage does not provide any information about women's status before or after the Revolution.\n\nD. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.\n- This option suggests that women remained without full political rights until the following century. The passage does not provide any information about women's political rights after the Revolution.\n\nGiven the passage's focus on the challenges faced by women during the Algerian War of Independence, the most appropriate political outcome described in the passage is:\n\nD. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
