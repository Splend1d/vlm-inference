The other conspirators assured him there would be no injuries or killings, but while in the bank they killed two people. Pursuant to the state's felony murder rule, the getaway driver was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. After exhausting his appeals, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear his case. He argued that he did not intend to kill and was not even present. What is the most likely holding of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.\nB. A conviction of first degree murder justifies the execution as long as aggravating circumstances are found to exist.\nC. The felony murder rule is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed.\nD. The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.\n"

The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.\n\nThe felony murder rule, which allows the death penalty for the murder of a co-conspirator during the commission of a robbery, is generally upheld by the Supreme Court. However, in this case, the defendant argues that he did not intend to kill and was not even present during the murder. The Supreme Court is likely to uphold the conviction and sentence, as the felony murder rule is generally considered constitutional and allows for the death penalty in certain circumstances."
