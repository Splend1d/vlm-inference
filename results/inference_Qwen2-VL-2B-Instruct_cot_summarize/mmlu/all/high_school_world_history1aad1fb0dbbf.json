Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following background facts persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage?\n\nA. China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk.\nB. The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable.\nC. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\nD. China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which background fact persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage, let's analyze the context and the core of the question:\n\nThe passage discusses the Chinese trade commissioner Lin Zexu's letter to Queen Victoria in 1839, where he argues against the importation of opium into Britain. Lin argues that opium is harmful to human health and should not be allowed to injure China's own country. He also mentions that China exports beneficial goods to other countries, and opium is not one of them.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk.\n- This option does not directly relate to the argument about the importation of opium. It is about the embargo on silk exports, which is not relevant to the argument about the importation of opium.\n\nB. The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable.\n- This option does not directly relate to the argument about the importation of opium. It is about the price of Chinese tea, which is not relevant to the argument about the importation of opium.\n\nC. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\n- This option directly relates to the argument about the importation of opium. Lin Zexu argues that the importation of opium into Britain would be harmful to human health and should not be allowed. This aligns with the idea that the importation of opium would be detrimental to China's own health and well-being.\n\nD. China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.\n- This option does not directly relate to the argument about the importation of opium. It is about the emperor's behavior towards the British ambassador, which is not relevant to the argument about the importation of opium.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option C directly supports the argument that the importation of opium into Britain would be harmful to human health and should not be allowed.\n\nFinal answer: C. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there."
