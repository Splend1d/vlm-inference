Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?\n\nA. 95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.\nB. There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.\nC.
