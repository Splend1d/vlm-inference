The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?\n\nA. No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\nB. Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.\nC. No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.\nD. Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.\n"

No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\n\nIn a sale-leaseback arrangement, the lessee typically has the right to make improvements to the property, but these improvements must be approved by the investor. The investor has the right to veto any changes that they believe would affect the value or use of the property. This is a common practice in leaseback agreements to ensure that the lessee does not make improvements that could negatively impact the investor's interests.\n\nThe investor's consent is crucial to maintain the agreement's terms and ensure that the lessee's business remains within the scope of the agreement. If the lessee makes drastic changes without the investor's consent, the court is likely to order the lessee to comply with the investor's demands, as it would be considered a breach of the lease agreement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
