A contingent remainder based upon whether or not cousin has heirs.\n\nIn modern real estate law, when a property is conveyed to a spouse and their heirs, the spouse generally acquires a fee simple absolute interest in the property. However, if the spouse dies intestate (without a will), the property passes to the spouse's heirs. If the spouse has no heirs, the property passes to the spouse's estate, which is subject to probate.\n\nWhen the man conveys the property to his niece in fee simple, he is transferring the property directly to her without any conditions or restrictions. This means that the niece acquires a fee simple absolute interest in the property. If the man's wife's cousin dies intestate, the niece will inherit the property from the estate of her cousin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
