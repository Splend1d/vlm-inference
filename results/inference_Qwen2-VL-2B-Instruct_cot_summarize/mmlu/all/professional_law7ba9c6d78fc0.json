The plaintiff claims that while he was cleaning the machine, two wires came into contact with each other and caused the machine to turn on. At trial, the manufacturer has offered evidence that it was unreasonably expensive to design the machine so that the wires could not come into contact. In rebuttal, the plaintiff offers evidence that after this action was filed, the manufacturer redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact. Is evidence of this change in design admissible?\n\nA. No, because the change in design may have been unrelated to this type of accident.\nB. No, under the rule regarding remedial measures that encourages manufacturers to make their products safer.\nC. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\nD. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the manufacturer was negligent because its initial design failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact.\n"

Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\n\nThe plaintiff's evidence that the manufacturer redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact is admissible because it is relevant to the plaintiff's claim that the machine was negligent in its design. This evidence shows that the manufacturer took steps to improve the machine's safety after the accident occurred, which could be interpreted as a response to the plaintiff's claim of negligence. This type of evidence is relevant to the issue of whether the manufacturer's initial design was inadequate and contributed to the accident. Therefore, it is admissible under the rule that encourages manufacturers to make their products safer."
