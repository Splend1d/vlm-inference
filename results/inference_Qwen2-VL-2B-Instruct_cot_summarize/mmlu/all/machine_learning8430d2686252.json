In AdaBoost, the weights of the misclassified examples are adjusted by a factor that is the same as the factor by which the training error is reduced. This is a key property of AdaBoost.\n\nStatement 2: In AdaBoost, weighted training error \\( e_t \\) of the \\( t \\)th weak classifier on training data with weights \\( D_t \\) tends to increase as a function of \\( t \\).\n- This statement is false. In AdaBoost, the weighted training error \\( e_t \\) of the \\( t \\)th weak classifier tends to decrease as a function of \\( t \\). The error decreases because the weights are adjusted to reduce the error, not increase it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
