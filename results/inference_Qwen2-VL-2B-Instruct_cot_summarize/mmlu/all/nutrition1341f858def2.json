Insufficient rainfall for agriculture - This is an immediate cause because it directly affects the availability of food resources for agriculture, which is a critical factor in malnutrition.\n\nB. Inadequate access to food - This is an immediate cause because it directly affects the availability of food resources for individuals, which is a critical factor in malnutrition.\n\nC. Inadequate care for mothers and children - This is an underlying cause because it is the cause of malnutrition, not the immediate cause.\n\nD.
