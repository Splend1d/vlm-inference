Europa, being farther from the Sun, would receive a lower solar flux.\n\nThe orbital distance of Europa is approximately 5 AU. The solar flux decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun. Therefore, for Europa to receive the same solar flux as Earth, the Sun would have to be 5 times brighter.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 50 times brighter"
