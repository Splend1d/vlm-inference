Single women\n\nFinancial adjustment to retirement can be particularly challenging for single women due to the lack of a spouse to share expenses and provide financial support. Single women may need to rely on their own savings, social security benefits, or other sources of income to cover their expenses during retirement. This can be a significant financial burden and may require careful planning and budgeting to ensure that they can meet their needs."
