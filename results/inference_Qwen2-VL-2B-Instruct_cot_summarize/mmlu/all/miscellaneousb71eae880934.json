The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. Which of the following is the best way of describing the last three sentences of the passage (\"They became . . . in judgment\") ?\n\nA. The sentences emphasize the weariness the sitters feel after a long day's work.\nB. The sentences are used to paint a picture of the way in which the sitters wish they spent their evenings.\nC. The sentences are a vivid way of describing the ease and authority the sitters feel during the evening.\nD. The sentences highlight the contrast between the feelings of the sitters and the feelings of the bossman.\n"

However, the passage does not explicitly mention the sitters feeling worn out or tired. The focus is more on the sitters' newfound sense of power and authority.\n\n2. **Wish for evenings**: This option implies that the sitters wish they could spend their evenings in a different way. While the passage does describe the sitters as feeling powerful and human, it does not explicitly suggest that they wish they could spend their evenings differently.\n\n3. **Ease and authority during the evening**: This option suggests that the sitters feel easy and authoritative during the evening. The passage does describe the sitters as sitting in judgment, which implies a sense of authority and control. However, the passage does not explicitly state that they feel easy or relaxed during the evening.\n\n4. **Contrast between the feelings of the sitters and the feelings of the bossman**: This option suggests a contrast between the sitters' feelings and the bossman's feelings. The passage does not explicitly compare the sitters' feelings to those of the bossman. It focuses more on the sitters' newfound sense of power and authority.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best way of describing the last three sentences is:\n\n**C. The sentences are a vivid way of describing the ease and authority the sitters feel during the evening.**\n\nFinal answer: C."
