A slippery-slope argument is one that assumes that a small initial step will inevitably lead to a catastrophic outcome, which is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The envisioned results of the action or practice under consideration turn out not to be bad.\n- This option suggests that the envisioned results are not necessarily bad. This does not necessarily make the argument fallacious; it could be that the initial step is not bad, but the overall outcome could still be bad.\n\nB. The central idea of the argument\u2014that the action or practice under consideration will lead us down a path to disaster-turns out not to be plausible.\n- This option suggests that the argument's central idea is not plausible. If the argument is not plausible, it does not necessarily mean that the argument is fallacious; it could be that the argument is not fallacious.\n\nC. both A and B are correct; either condition would make the argument fallacious.\n- This option suggests that both conditions are correct. If both conditions are true, the argument could still be fallacious because the initial step could be bad, and the overall outcome could still be bad.\n\nD. neither A nor B is correct; neither condition would make the argument fallacious.\n- This option suggests that neither condition is correct. If neither condition is correct, then neither condition would make the argument fallacious.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. both A and B are correct; either condition would make the argument fallacious.\n\nThis option indicates that the argument could be fallacious if either condition is true."
