Potato cells plasmolyze.\n\nWhen a potato is dropped into a beaker of pure water, the water surrounding the potato will move into the potato due to the osmotic pressure created by the water inside the potato. This process is known as plasmolysis, where the cell membrane of the potato becomes permeable to water, causing the cell to swell and eventually burst."
