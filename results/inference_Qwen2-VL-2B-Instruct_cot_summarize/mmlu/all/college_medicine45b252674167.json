The gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h, and it was recorded by a camera on a platform 200 meters away traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. If the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800Hz, what is the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at?\n\nA. 941 Hz\nB. 787 Hz\nC. 924 Hz\nD. 912 Hz\n"

The formula for the Doppler effect is:\n\n\\[ f' = f \\left( \\frac{v}{v + c} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f \\) is the frequency of the sound,\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity of the source relative to the observer,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of sound in the medium.\n\nGiven:\n- The speed of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s,\n- The speed of the car is 108 km/h, which is equivalent to 30 m/s,\n- The speed of the camera is 72 km/h, which is equivalent to 20 m/s,\n- The distance between the source and the observer is 200 meters.\n\nFirst, convert the speeds to the same unit (m/s) for consistency:\n- Speed of the car: 30 m/s,\n- Speed of the camera: 20 m/s.\n\nNow, plug these values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\n\\[ f' = 800 \\left( \\frac{30}{30 + 20} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ f' = 800 \\left( \\frac{30}{50} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ f' = 800 \\times 0.6 \\]\n\n\\[ f' = 480 Hz \\]\n\nHowever, this is the perceived frequency of the gunshot by the camera. To find the actual perceived frequency by the actor inside the car, we need to consider the relative motion between the car and the camera. Since the car is moving towards the camera, the frequency perceived by the actor will be lower than the actual frequency.\n\nThe actual frequency perceived by the actor is:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{actor}} = f' \\times \\frac{v_{\\text{actor}}}{v_{\\text{source}}} \\]\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{actor}} = 480 \\times \\frac{20}{30} \\]\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{actor}} = 480 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{actor}} = 320 Hz \\]\n\nTherefore, the perceived frequency by the actor inside the car is 320 Hz. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 924 Hz"
