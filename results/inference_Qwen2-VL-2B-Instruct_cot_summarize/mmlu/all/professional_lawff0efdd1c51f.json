Here's a step-by-step analysis of the options:\n\n1. **Identify the Context and Core of the Question**: The scenario involves a misunderstanding in the price offered by the buyer, leading to a miscommunication between the parties. The key point is to determine the legal consequences based on the intended price.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\"\n     - This option suggests that the parties attached different meanings to the price term, leading to a lack of contract formation. However, the letter of reply clearly states acceptance of the offer, implying a contract was formed.\n   - **Option B**: \"There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption.\"\n     - This option suggests that the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake, which would invalidate the contract. However, the letter of reply clearly states acceptance, implying a contract was formed.\n   - **Option C**: \"There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.\"\n     - This option suggests that the contract was formed at the intended price of $2,000 per acre. However, the letter of reply clearly states acceptance of the offer at $2,200 per acre, indicating that the contract was formed at a different price.\n   - **Option D**: \"There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\"\n     - This option suggests that the contract was formed at the higher price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention. This is incorrect because the letter of reply clearly states acceptance of the offer at $2,200 per acre.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is **Option A**: \"There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\" This option accurately reflects that the parties attached different meanings to the price term, leading to a lack of contract formation."
