If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then identical twins are more likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins and other siblings.\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the principle of genetic similarity in identical twins, which is a fundamental concept in behavioral genetics. Identical twins, who share the same genetic material, are more likely to share certain psychological attributes because they have the same genetic makeup. In contrast, fraternal twins, who share a portion of their genetic material, are less likely to share these attributes due to the random assortment of genetic material during fertilization. This principle is crucial for understanding the genetic basis of behavioral traits and for developing genetic interventions or treatments."
