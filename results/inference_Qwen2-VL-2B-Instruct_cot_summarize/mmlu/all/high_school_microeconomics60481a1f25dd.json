Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers\n\nWhen expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers increase, it suggests that the price of orange juice will be higher in the future, which will shift the demand curve for orange juice to the right. This is because consumers will be willing to pay more for orange juice in the future, as they expect it to be more expensive in the present."
