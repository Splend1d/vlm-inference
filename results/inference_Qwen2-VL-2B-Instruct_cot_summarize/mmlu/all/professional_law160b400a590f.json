A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.\nB. Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\nC. No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\nD. No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the boy will prevail in his claim against the collector, we need to analyze the situation and the relevant legal principles.\n\n1. **Nature of the Claim**: The boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit. This means he is claiming that the collector made a false representation of the card's value.\n\n2. **Nature of the Offer**: The collector offered the boy 50 cents for the 1948 Branch Rickey baseball card. The boy accepted this offer, and the collector then offered the card for $600, which is significantly more than the 50 cents he initially offered.\n\n3. **Nature of the Bargain**: The boy entered into a bargain with the collector, agreeing to accept the offer of 50 cents for the card. The collector then offered a significantly higher price, which the boy accepted.\n\n4. **Nature of the Deception**: The collector made a false representation of the card's value by offering the boy the card for $600, which is significantly more than the 50 cents he initially offered.\n\nGiven these points, the key issue is whether the collector made a false representation of the card's value.\n\n- **Option A**: \"Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.\"\n  - This option suggests that the collector did not disclose the true value of the card. However, the collector did disclose the value of the card to the boy, who accepted it. This does not constitute a false representation.\n\n- **Option B**: \"Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\"\n  - This option suggests that the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain. However, the boy accepted the offer of 50 cents, which was significantly less than the collector's offer, indicating that the boy was not entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\n\n- **Option C**: \"No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\"\n  - This option suggests that the collector did not make a false representation of fact. However, the collector did make a false representation of the card's value by offering the boy the card for $600, which was significantly more than the 50 cents he initially offered.\n\n- **Option D**: \"No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.\"\n  - This option suggests that the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer. However, the boy accepted the offer of 50 cents, which was significantly less than the collector's offer, indicating that the boy was justified in relying on the offer.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**Option D**: \"No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.\"\n\nThe boy was justified in relying on the offer of 50 cents, which was significantly less than the collector's offer, and thus did not rely on the collector's false representation of the card's value."
