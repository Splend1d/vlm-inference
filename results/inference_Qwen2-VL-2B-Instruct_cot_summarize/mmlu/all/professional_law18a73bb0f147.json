The key elements of the defense would be:\n\n1. **Intentional or Negligent Act**: The defendant must prove that he did not intend to kill the victim or that he was negligent in setting the fire.\n2. **Causation**: The defendant must show that the fire was not intentionally set but rather an accident or an act of negligence.\n3. **Causation**: The defendant must demonstrate that the fire was not intentionally set but rather an accident or an act of negligence.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The defendant did not intend to kill the victim**: This assertion is likely to be strong if the defendant can prove that he did not have any malicious intent to harm the victim. This would remove liability for felony murder.\n\nB. **The defendant was insane when he set the fire**: This assertion is unlikely to be strong. If the defendant was insane, it would be difficult to prove that he did not intend to kill the victim. The insanity defense would be more about the defendant's mental state rather than the intent to kill.\n\nC. **The defendant was coerced by another to set the fire**: This assertion is likely to be strong if the defendant can prove that he was coerced into setting the fire by someone else. This would remove liability for felony murder.\n\nD. **The victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom**: This assertion is likely to be strong if the defendant can prove that the fire was not intentionally set but rather an accident or an act of negligence. The victim's death due to a heart attack would not necessarily remove liability for felony murder if the fire was set intentionally.\n\nGiven these analyses, the assertion that least likely removes liability for felony murder is:\n\n**B. The defendant was insane when he set the fire.**"
