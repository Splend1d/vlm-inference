Technology in the harvesting of coffee beans improves.\n\nWhen technology improves the efficiency of coffee harvesting, it leads to a decrease in the cost of producing coffee, which in turn increases the supply of coffee. This increase in supply would likely result in a decrease in the price of coffee, which would most likely increase the demand for coffee. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
