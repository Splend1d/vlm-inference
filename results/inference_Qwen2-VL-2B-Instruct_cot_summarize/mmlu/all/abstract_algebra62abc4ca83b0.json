Closure: For all a, b in H, a * b is also in H.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in H, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n3. Identity: There exists an element e in H such that for all a in H, a * e = e * a = a.\n4. Inverses: For each a in H, there exists an element b in H such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nThe identity element is the element that, when multiplied by any element in the group, leaves that element unchanged. Therefore, the identity element must be in the subset H."
