The electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r^2, where k is the Coulomb constant, q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point on the field line. In this case, the charge density is \u03c3, and the distance from the plane to the point on the field line is the distance from the plane to the point below the plane. Therefore, the electric field below the plane is given by E = \u03c3 / (2 * \u03b5o), where \u03b5o is the permittivity of free space. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
