If a random number matches a voided purchase order, the auditor will replace the voided purchase order with another if the voided purchase order:\n\nA. Represents office equipment ordered and never received.\n\nThis is because if the voided purchase order represents office equipment ordered and never received, it indicates that the purchase order was not properly approved and processed, which is a potential control weakness. Therefore, the auditor should replace the voided purchase order with another to ensure that the purchase order is properly approved and processed.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the auditor's selection process or the purpose of the inspection:\n\nB. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\nThis option is irrelevant because it does not address the auditor's selection process or the purpose of the inspection.\n\nC.
