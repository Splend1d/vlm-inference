A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nMoreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations?\n\nA. Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\nB. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\nC. Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\nD. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the best generalization based on the information provided, let's analyze the context and the key points:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage discusses the existence of separate states in Northern India during the Mughal Empire, noting that the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion. It also mentions that a zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was in a position of dependence, and that such an omission might arise from various other causes.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\"\n     - The passage does not provide information about the religion of those who paid revenue. It only mentions that a zamindar who paid revenue was in a position of dependence.\n   - **Option B**: \"Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\"\n     - The passage does not discuss geographical differences influencing tax collection. It focuses on the Mogul authorities' inability to effectively enforce taxes.\n   - **Option C**: \"Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\"\n     - The passage does not suggest that revenue collection was the only source of funds. It mentions that the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion, implying that other sources of funds were also in place.\n   - **Option D**: \"The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\"\n     - The passage does not provide specific details about the case of Rajputana. It only mentions that Rajputana was a region where chiefs and tribes occupied an anomalous position and sometimes paid revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoyed practical independence.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the question, the best generalization based on the information provided is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.**"
