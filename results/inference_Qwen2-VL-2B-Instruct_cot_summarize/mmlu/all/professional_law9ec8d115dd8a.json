Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement is least accurate with respect to the buyer's deed, we need to analyze the relevant clauses and their implications.\n\n1. **Covenant Prohibiting Mobile Homes:**\n   - The developer's deed prohibits the construction of mobile homes on any lot within the subdivision.\n   - The builder's deed also prohibits the construction of mobile homes on any lot within the subdivision.\n\n2. **Covenants Running with the Land:**\n   - The covenant prohibiting mobile homes runs with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\n\n3. **Enforcement of Covenants:**\n   - The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\n\n4. **Constructive Notice:**\n   - The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.**\n   - This statement is accurate because the covenant prohibiting mobile homes runs with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\n\nB. **The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.**\n   - This statement is accurate because the covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\n\nC. **The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.**\n   - This statement is accurate because the buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\n\nD. **All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.**\n   - This statement is not accurate. The builder's deed does not automatically transfer the restriction against mobile homes to subsequent grantees. The restriction remains with the builder and the builder's successors.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is least accurate with respect to the buyer's deed is:\n\n**D. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.**"
