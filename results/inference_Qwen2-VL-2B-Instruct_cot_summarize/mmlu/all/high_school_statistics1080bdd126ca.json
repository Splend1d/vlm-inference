Here's a detailed analysis of each option:\n\nA. **Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.**\n   - This option would include a wide range of customers, including those with diverse musical tastes. However, it does not account for the geographical variability, which could skew the sample towards customers with similar tastes.\n\nB. **Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.**\n   - This option would ensure that the sample is representative of the entire customer base, including those with diverse musical tastes. It would likely include a mix of customers from different geographical regions, thus providing a more diverse and representative sample.\n\nC. **From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.**\n   - This option would likely result in a sample that is biased towards customers from specific states, potentially overlooking customers from other regions. This could lead to a sample that is not representative of the entire customer base.\n\nD. **From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.**\n   - This option would also likely result in a biased sample, as it would include a significant number of customers from specific states, potentially overlooking customers from other regions. This could lead to a sample that is not representative of the entire customer base.\n\nGiven the variability in musical tastes across different geographical regions, the most representative sample would be one that includes a mix of customers from different states. Therefore, the best option is:\n\n**B.
