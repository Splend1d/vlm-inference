It is partly related to sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial phase, which is the period immediately following a meal. This stimulation leads to an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolic rate, which helps to increase energy expenditure and contribute to weight loss or maintenance of weight."
