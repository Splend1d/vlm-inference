To measure galactic energy-density.\n\nCepheid stars are relevant for astronomers because they are variable stars that can be used to measure the energy density of the universe. Cepheid stars are stars that have a constant mass and a constant radius, and they are known for their ability to change their brightness over time. This makes them ideal for measuring the energy density of the universe, which is the amount of energy present in the universe."
