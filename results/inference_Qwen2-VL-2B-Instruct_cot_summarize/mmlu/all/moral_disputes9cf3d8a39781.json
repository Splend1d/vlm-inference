However, based on the context provided, it seems that Singer is likely discussing the potential consequences of genetic engineering on society. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Loss of human diversity: This is a serious concern because genetic engineering could potentially lead to a loss of genetic diversity, which is crucial for the survival and adaptation of species.\n\nB. Effects of engineering children to have positional goods: This is also a serious concern because it could lead to a loss of human freedom and autonomy, as children would be engineered to have certain characteristics or abilities.\n\nC. Loss of equality of opportunity: This is a serious concern because genetic engineering could potentially lead to a loss of equality of opportunity, as children would be engineered to have certain characteristics or abilities that could give them an advantage over others.\n\nD. Increased disparity between the rich and the poor: This is a serious concern because genetic engineering could potentially lead to a widening of the wealth gap, as the wealthy could have access to genetic enhancements that the less wealthy could not afford.\n\nGiven the context provided, it seems that Singer is likely discussing the potential consequences of genetic engineering on society. Therefore, the least serious concern mentioned in the options is:\n\n**B. Effects of engineering children to have positional goods**"
