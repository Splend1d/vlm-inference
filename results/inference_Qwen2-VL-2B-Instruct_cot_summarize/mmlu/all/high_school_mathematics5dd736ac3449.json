So, to find the points on the graph of $y=f(f(x))$, we need to find the points on the graph of $y=f(x)$ and then apply the second function to those points.\n\nThe points on the graph of $y=f(x)$ are $(1,5)$, $(2,3)$, and $(3,1)$. Applying the second function to these points, we get $(1,5)$ becomes $(1,5)$, $(2,3)$ becomes $(2,3)$, and $(3,1)$ becomes $(3,1)$.\n\nSo, the points $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are $(1,5)$ and $(3,1)$, respectively. The product $ab+cd$ is $1*5+3*1=5+3=\\boxed{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
