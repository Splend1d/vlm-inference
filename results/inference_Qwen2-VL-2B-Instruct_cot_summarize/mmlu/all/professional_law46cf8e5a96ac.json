One night, he was working backstage security for one of his favorite bands when he noticed a groupie sneak in the back door, pick up a guitar, and begin to walk out with it. He drew his service revolver and exclaimed, \"Stop or I'll shoot!\" The groupie looked at him and then fled. The defendant fired at the fleeing groupie, fatally wounding her. Use of force was not authorized by the concert promotion company that employed him. On these facts, if the defendant is charged with murder, he should be found\n\nA. guilty.\nB. not guilty, because the killing constituted justifiable homicide.\nC. not guilty, because the killing constituted excusable homicide.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant warned the groupie before he fired his gun.\n"

The defendant, an off-duty police officer, was working security at a concert and noticed a groupie attempting to steal a guitar. He drew his service revolver and threatened the groupie with the gun, exclaiming, \"Stop or I'll shoot!\" The groupie fled, and the defendant fired at the fleeing groupie, causing her to die.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the defendant's actions were justified under the circumstances. The defendant's actions can be evaluated under the standards of \"justifiable homicide\" or \"excusable homicide.\"\n\n1. **Justifiable Homicide**: This occurs when the defendant used force to prevent a grave danger to themselves or others. In this case, the defendant's actions were not justified because he was not in a position to prevent a grave danger to himself or others. The defendant's actions were not reasonable in light of the situation.\n\n2. **Excusable Homicide**: This occurs when the defendant used force to prevent a grave danger to themselves or others, but the danger was not immediate. In this case, the defendant's actions were not justified because the danger was not immediate. The defendant's actions were not reasonable in light of the situation.\n\nGiven the defendant's actions, the most appropriate analysis is that they were not justified under the circumstances. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. guilty."
