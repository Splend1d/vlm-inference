Yes, but the sign can\u2019t be determined.\n\nThe normal force from the floor does work on the man, but the direction of the work depends on the orientation of the force relative to the direction of motion. If the man is moving upwards, the normal force is in the direction of motion, and the work done is positive. If the man is moving downwards, the normal force is in the opposite direction of motion, and the work done is negative. Therefore, the sign of the work done cannot be determined without knowing the direction of motion."
