Therefore, the force felt by the lighter person is:\n\nF - F = 0\n\nThe acceleration of the lighter person is the change in velocity divided by the change in time. The change in velocity is the force exerted by the heavier person minus the force exerted by the lighter person on the heavier person, which is 0. The change in time is the time it takes for the force to be applied, which is negligible in this case since the force is applied instantaneously. Therefore, the acceleration of the lighter person is:\n\na = F / m = 0 / 100 = 0\n\nThe magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person is 0, which is not half or twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person"
