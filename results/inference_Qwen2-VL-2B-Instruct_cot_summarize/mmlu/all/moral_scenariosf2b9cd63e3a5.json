This is not inherently wrong, as it is a normal and common human experience. However, the character's decision to leave work early could be seen as a morally wrong action if they did not consider the consequences or the impact on their employer and colleagues.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character used \"I\" to describe locking their parents' gun safe, which is a morally wrong action. Locking a gun safe is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, including injury or death if the gun is accidentally discharged. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
