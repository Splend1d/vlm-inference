This means that as the quantity of a good increases, the marginal cost of producing that good also increases. This principle is often illustrated by the production possibilities frontier, which shows the relationship between the quantity of two goods that can be produced with a given amount of resources. The law of increasing costs implies that the production possibilities frontier will be a straight line, with the slope of the line representing the marginal cost of producing each good."
