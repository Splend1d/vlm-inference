The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides\nB. Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum\nC. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion\nD. The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters\n"

The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides\n\nProtein digestion occurs in the stomach, where pepsin and trypsin break down proteins into smaller peptides. These peptides are then absorbed into the bloodstream as free amino acids."
