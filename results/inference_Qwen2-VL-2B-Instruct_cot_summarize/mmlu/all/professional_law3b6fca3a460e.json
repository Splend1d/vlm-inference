A physician verified that the man suffered from hallucinations that impaired his volitional abilities, preventing a voluntary confession. Will the court suppress the statements?\n\nA. Yes, he was insane and could not have given a voluntary confession.\nB. Yes, the police overreached by not having him mentally evaluated before questioning him.\nC. No, there was no police misconduct or overreaching, and as a result the confession is voluntary.\nD. No, a confession is admissible when accompanied by actions by the defendant that prove the truth of the statements.\n"

Here's why:\n\n1. **Voluntary Confession**: The man took them to the scene of the murder where they found the victim's body. This act indicates that he was aware of the crime and was not coerced into confessing. The physician verified that he suffered from hallucinations, which impaired his volitional abilities, preventing a voluntary confession.\n\n2. **Police Conduct**: The police read him his constitutional rights and did not overreach by not having him mentally evaluated before questioning him. The man's claim of being ordered to confess by voices is not supported by the evidence found at the scene.\n\n3. **Admissibility of Statements**: The statements made by the man are admissible because they were voluntarily given and were not coerced. The physician's verification of his mental state does not affect the admissibility of the statements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. No, there was no police misconduct or overreaching, and as a result the confession is voluntary."
