To prevent the securitization of irrelevant threats and to challenge the legitimacy of currently securitized threats.\n\nDesecuritization is the process of removing or reducing the importance of security measures and policies that are no longer relevant or effective in addressing contemporary threats. This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Removing or reducing the number of security actors and their roles.\n2. Reducing the scope of security measures and policies.\n3. Reducing the intensity and frequency of security interventions.\n4. Reducing the reliance on extraordinary measures and other non-traditional security tools.\n\nBy advocating for desecuritization, one can:\n\n- Reduce the risk of over-reliance on security measures that may not be effective in addressing new or emerging threats.\n- Encourage a more balanced and comprehensive approach to security that considers multiple perspectives and stakeholders.\n- Promote a more democratic and participatory approach to security governance.\n- Foster a culture of resilience and adaptability to changing security challenges.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most relevant and important reason to advocate for desecuritization."
