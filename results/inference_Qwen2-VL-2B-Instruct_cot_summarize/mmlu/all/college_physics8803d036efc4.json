                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nThe photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where light of a certain frequency can cause electrons to be emitted from the surface of a metal. The work function of the metal is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface. According to Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect, the work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency of the light that causes the emission of electrons. This means that the higher the frequency of the light, the greater the work function required to stop the emitted electrons.\n\nThe potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. This is because the work function is proportional to the frequency, and the potential difference required to stop the electrons is directly proportional to the work function. Therefore, the potential difference is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency."
