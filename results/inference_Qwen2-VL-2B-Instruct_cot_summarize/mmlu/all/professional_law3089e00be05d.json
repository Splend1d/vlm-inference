The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court will likely affirm the lower court decision, we need to analyze the legal principles and the context of the case.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The teenager borrowed a car from his uncle, who knew the teenager was incapable of driving safely. The teenager had a history of license suspensions, negligence lawsuits, multiple DUIs, and was an alcoholic. The teenager was involved in an accident and was seriously injured.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n\n   - **Option A**: \"Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\"\n     - This option suggests that the court will likely affirm the lower court decision because public policy generally prohibits the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made. However, the context of the case is not about public policy but rather about the duty of care owed by the uncle to the teenager.\n\n   - **Option B**: \"Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\"\n     - This option suggests that the court will likely affirm the lower court decision because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor. However, the case does not involve comparative negligence; it involves a first-party negligent entrustment claim.\n\n   - **Option C**: \"No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\"\n     - This option suggests that the court will likely affirm the lower court decision because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee. However, the case does not involve public policy; it involves a first-party negligent entrustment claim.\n\n   - **Option D**: \"No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\"\n     - This option suggests that the court will likely affirm the lower court decision because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator. However, the case does not involve a first-party negligent entrustment claim; it involves a negligent entrustment claim by the uncle.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis of each option, the correct answer is:\n\n**Option C**: No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee."
