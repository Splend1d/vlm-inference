The age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young.\n\nThis organism is likely to be a species that gives birth to only one offspring at a time, which is characteristic of many species that are capable of rapid growth and reproduction. This rapid growth and reproduction can lead to a high demand for resources, which may require the parents to invest a significant amount of time and energy in raising the offspring. This can result in relatively high parental care of offspring, as the parents must ensure that the offspring are healthy and well-nourished. Therefore, the organism is likely to require relatively high parental care of offspring."
