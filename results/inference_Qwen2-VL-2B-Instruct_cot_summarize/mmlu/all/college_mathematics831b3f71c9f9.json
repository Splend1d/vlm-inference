A function \\( f \\) is continuous on a compact set \\( X \\) if and only if \\( f \\) is bounded on \\( X \\). However, uniform continuity does not necessarily follow from being continuous and compact. Uniform continuity requires that \\( f \\) is bounded and continuous at every point in \\( X \\), which is not necessarily the case for compact sets.\n\nStatement 2: \"If f(x), g(x) : R \u2192 R are everywhere differentiable f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable.\"\n\nThis statement is true. If \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are everywhere differentiable, then the composition \\( f(g(x)) \\) will also be everywhere differentiable. This is because the derivative of a composition of functions is the composition of the derivatives, and the derivative of a function is defined for all points in its domain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. True, False"
