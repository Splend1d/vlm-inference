It was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength.\n- This is not a plausible explanation because Mars has a strong magnetic field, and the magnetic field would not have been able to strip away water.\n\nB. It was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape.\n- This is a plausible explanation because Mars has a thick atmosphere that contains a significant amount of hydrogen. Ultraviolet light can break down the hydrogen in the atmosphere, and the hydrogen would escape through thermal escape.\n\nC. It was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians.\n- This is not a plausible explanation because there is no evidence of any intelligent life on Mars.\n\nD. It was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape.\n- This is a plausible explanation because Mars has a thick atmosphere, and volcanic activity can release large amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. This vapor would then escape through thermal escape.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible explanation is:\n\nD. It was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
