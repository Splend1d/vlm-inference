Both A and C.\n\nWhen an autosomal gene undergoes a mutation that introduces a new allele, which is inherited according to incomplete dominance, the population will experience stabilizing selection. This means that the population will tend to stabilize around a certain level of heterozygosity, as the new allele will be more likely to be fixed in the population due to the stabilizing selection.\n\nOver many generations, the proportions of both types of homozygotes (homozygous recessive and homozygous dominant) should decrease, as the new allele will be more likely to be fixed in the population. This is because the new allele will be more likely to be expressed in heterozygotes, leading to a decrease in the frequency of heterozygotes.\n\nThe proportion of the population that is heterozygous at this locus should remain constant, as the new allele will be more likely to be fixed in the population due to the stabilizing selection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Both A and C."
