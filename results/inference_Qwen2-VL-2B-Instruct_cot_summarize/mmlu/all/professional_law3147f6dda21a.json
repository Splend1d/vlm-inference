The man intended to take back some tools that he believed were his and that the neighbor was keeping unlawfully. The woman believed that the tools were the man's, and she intended to help the man take them. When the son learned that the man and the woman were going to break into the neighbor's home, he decided to accompany them. The son planned to find some items inside that might be worth taking. Arriving at the neighbor's home, the man opened the front door, which was closed but unlocked. Upon entering, the son went to the neighbor's upstairs bedroom and found a watch, which he took. In the meantime, the man and the woman went to the garage and began rummaging through the neighbor's tools. The man found the tools, which he seized. The three of them then left the neighbor's home. In this jurisdiction, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering of any structure with the intent to commit a felony therein. Which, if any, individuals should be found guilty of conspiracy?\n\nA. The man, the woman, and the son.\nB. The man and the woman.\nC. The woman and the son.\nD. None.\n"

In this case, the neighbor's home is the structure, and the intent to commit a felony is the intent to commit a felony within the structure.\n\nThe man and the woman intended to take back some tools that they believed were their own, which they believed were unlawfully kept by the neighbor. The son, however, intended to accompany them and find items worth taking, which suggests that he was not involved in the intent to commit a felony within the neighbor's home.\n\nTherefore, the man and the woman should be found guilty of conspiracy because they intended to commit a felony within the neighbor's home, which is burglary. The son, on the other hand, was not involved in the intent to commit a felony within the neighbor's home and should not be found guilty of conspiracy.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. The man and the woman."
