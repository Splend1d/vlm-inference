To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?\n\nA. Limestone is never pure CaCO3.\nB. Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.\nC. Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.\nD. Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.\n"

The carbonate salt that is commonly found in limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), but there could be other carbonate salts present, such as calcium hydrogen carbonate (Ca(HCO3)). These other carbonate salts could be reacting with the acid to form carbon dioxide gas, which would be collected over water and measured. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
