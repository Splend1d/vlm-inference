However, the size of these two matrices are the same.\n\nThis statement is false. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Spectral Clustering are both dimensionality reduction techniques that use eigendecomposition, but they operate on different types of matrices. PCA is typically applied to data that is already in a lower-dimensional space, such as a set of points in a 2D or 3D space. Spectral Clustering, on the other hand, is applied to data that is already in a higher-dimensional space, such as a set of points in a 2D or 3D space, and it uses eigendecomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the data.\n\nStatement 2: Since classification is a special case of regression, logistic regression is a special case of linear regression.\n\nThis statement is true. Logistic regression is indeed a special case of linear regression, as it is used for classification problems where the target variable is binary or categorical. In logistic regression, the goal is to predict the probability of an event occurring, which is a continuous variable, rather than a categorical variable."
