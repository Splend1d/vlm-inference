It encouraged the centralization of political power in the US\n\nThe Philadelphian System, also known as the Federalist System, was a political system proposed by Alexander Hamilton in the United States. It was designed to centralize political power in the federal government, with the states having limited powers. This system was intended to prevent the kind of political instability and power struggles that Hamilton believed were common in European countries. By centralizing power, the system was seen as a way to ensure a stable and stable political system in the United States."
