When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This correlation demonstrates:\n\nA. the value of cultural capital.\nB. a meritocracy. \nC. he value of social capital.\nD. a false association.\n"

The value of social capital.\n\nThe study's findings indicate that social networks that overlap with the alumni networks of the selective colleges are positively correlated with admission acceptance, with a correlation coefficient of +0.61. This suggests that having a strong social network with alumni connections can be a significant factor in admissions to these highly selective colleges. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
