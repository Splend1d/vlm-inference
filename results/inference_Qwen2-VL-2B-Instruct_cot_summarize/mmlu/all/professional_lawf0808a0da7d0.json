Female students who attend half-time are still permitted a $100 tax exemption, whereas male students who attend half-time are no longer permitted any tax exemption. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the correct rule of constitutional law regarding the state tax exemption for students who enroll half-time?\n\nA. The tax exemption would be invalidated as a denial of due process.\nB. The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause.\nC. The tax measure would be upheld as within the area of substantive due process.\nD. The tax measure would be upheld as within the power of a municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.\n"

The tax measure would be upheld as within the power of a municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.\n\nThis option accurately reflects that the state tax exemption for female students who attend half-time is a discriminatory practice that violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The equal protection clause guarantees that laws must be applied equally to all individuals, regardless of their gender or other protected characteristics. Therefore, the state's tax exemption for female students is unconstitutional and would be invalidated under this constitutional principle."
