The suspect was later arrested for murder; he filed for suppression of the gun. Will the suppression court throw out the gun?\n\nA. No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.\nB. No, the entry did not require an arrest warrant because the authorities already had established probable cause.\nC. Yes, the entry was a violation of the knock and announce rule.\nD.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Exigent Circumstances**: The entry was made under exigent circumstances, which means the police had probable cause to believe that the suspect was in the home and posed a danger to themselves or others. This is a legal doctrine that allows law enforcement to enter a home without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that the suspect is in the home and poses a danger.\n\n2. **Knock and Announce Rule**: The police were required to knock and announce before entering the home. However, they did not need an arrest warrant because they had probable cause to believe that the suspect was in the home and posed a danger.\n\n3. **Gun Seizure**: The police seized a handgun that was in plain view. This is a violation of the knock and announce rule, which requires the police to announce their presence before entering the home.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.**"
