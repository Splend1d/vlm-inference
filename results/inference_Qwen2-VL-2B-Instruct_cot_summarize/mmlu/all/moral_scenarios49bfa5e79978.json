The act of making the toddler touch a stove, even if it was done to teach him about the danger of stoves, is considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm to the child. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) took down a sign offering a big reward for the lost dog because he found the dog. This action is not considered morally wrong because it was done in a situation where the dog was lost and the sign was not intended to be a reward for the dog's return."
