The detection of white matter abnormalities\n\nMRI is generally preferred over CT for detecting white matter abnormalities because MRI provides more detailed images of the brain's white matter, which is crucial for diagnosing conditions like multiple sclerosis and other white matter diseases. CT, on the other hand, is less sensitive for detecting white matter abnormalities due to its lower resolution and lack of contrast."
