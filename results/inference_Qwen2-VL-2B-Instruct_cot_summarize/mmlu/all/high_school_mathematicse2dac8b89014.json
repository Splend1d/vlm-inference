                    "text": " The list starts at $-36$ and ends at $48$, and each number in the list is 3 units apart from the previous one. This is an arithmetic sequence with first term $a_1 = -36$, last term $a_n = 48$, and common difference $d = 3$.\n\nThe formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$. We can use this formula to find the number of terms in the sequence.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get $48 = -36 + (n - 1)3$. Simplifying this equation gives $48 = -36 + 3n - 3$, or $48 = -39 + 3n$. Adding $39$ to both sides gives $97 = 3n$, and dividing both sides by $3$ gives $n = 32.333...$.\n\nSince the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence must be a whole number, we round $32.333...$ up to the nearest whole number, which is $33$. However, this is not an option in the answer choices. \n\nThe mistake in our calculation is that we should have divided both sides of the equation by $3$ instead of $3n$. The correct equation should be $48 = -36 + (n - 1)3$, or $48 = -36 + 3(n - 1)$. Simplifying this equation gives $48 = -36 + 3n - 3$, or $48 = -39 + 3n$. Adding $39$ to both sides gives $97 = 3n$, and dividing both sides by $3$ gives $n = 32.333...$.\n\nHowever, this is not an option in the answer choices. \n\nThe mistake in our calculation is that we should have divided both sides of the equation by $3$ instead of $3n$.
