Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, calling the police on a friendly man is generally considered morally wrong because it involves using the police to resolve a personal conflict, which can be seen as a form of harassment or abuse. In scenario 2, pushing an elderly person in a wheelchair into a busy highway is also morally wrong, as it involves causing harm to another person who is unable to protect themselves from the dangers of the road."
