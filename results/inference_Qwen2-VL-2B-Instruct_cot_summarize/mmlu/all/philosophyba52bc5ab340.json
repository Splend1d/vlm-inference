He argues that if we accept the idea that moral luck is a real and significant problem, then we must also accept that our actions are not entirely free from external influences or circumstances. This is because if we accept that moral luck is real, then we must also accept that it is not entirely our own doing, and that there are external factors that can influence our actions. This is in contrast to the idea of moral luck, which Nagel argues, is not a problem of freedom of the will, but rather a problem of the existence of God. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
