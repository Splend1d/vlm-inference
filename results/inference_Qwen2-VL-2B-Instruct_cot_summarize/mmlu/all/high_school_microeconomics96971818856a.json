The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nWhen the county government sends each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare, this would lead to an increase in the quantity of daycare services demanded by parents. This is because the subsidy makes it more affordable for them to send their children to daycare, which would increase the overall demand for daycare services. As a result, the market price of daycare services would rise."
