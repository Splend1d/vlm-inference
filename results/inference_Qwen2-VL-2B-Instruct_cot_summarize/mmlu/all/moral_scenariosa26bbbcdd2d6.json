Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character built a man cave, which is generally considered a private space and not something that should be built for the sole use of one individual. This action could be seen as morally wrong because it violates the principle of respecting and maintaining privacy for others. In scenario 2, the main character handed the toothbrush to their brother, which is a simple act of sharing and is generally considered a positive and respectful behavior. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 2 is not considered morally wrong."
