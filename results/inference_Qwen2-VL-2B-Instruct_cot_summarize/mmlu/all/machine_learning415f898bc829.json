Minimizes the within class variance for a given number of clusters\n\nThe K-means algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups. It works by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest cluster center and then recalculating the cluster centers based on the new assignments. The algorithm aims to minimize the within-class variance, which is the sum of the squared distances between each data point and its cluster center. This ensures that the clusters are as compact as possible, which can lead to better separation of data points."
