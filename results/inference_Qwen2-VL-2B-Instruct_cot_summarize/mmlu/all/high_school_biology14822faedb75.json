The flu virus, which changes its envelope proteins.\n\nThis is because the flu virus, like many pathogens, relies on antigenic variation to evade the immune system. The flu virus changes its surface proteins, known as envelope proteins, to create new variants that are less likely to be recognized by the immune system. This process is known as antigenic variation and is a key mechanism by which pathogens evade the immune system."
