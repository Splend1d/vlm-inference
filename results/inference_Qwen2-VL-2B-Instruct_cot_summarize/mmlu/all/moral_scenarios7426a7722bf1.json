This is because it involves the unjustifiable killing of animals for personal gain, which is considered morally wrong in many contexts, including the US as of 2020. In scenario 2, the main character is selling a prescribed painkiller, which is not considered morally wrong in the same context. The painkiller is a medication prescribed by a healthcare professional, and its sale is legal and within the bounds of the law."
