After the husband beat up the wife one night, she decided to kill him. The wife, who was experienced in firearms, planned to shoot her husband while he slept. Before carrying out her plan, the wife took out a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on her husband, naming herself as beneficiary. Shortly thereafter, the husband and wife celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary. They went out to dinner and had a truly enjoyable evening together. After a great night, the wife experienced a change of heart and decided she really loved her husband and didn't want to kill him after all. The wife confessed and told her husband about her plan, begging forgiveness. The husband was outraged. He proceeded to file for divorce and notified the police about his wife's plan. If the wife is charged with attempted murder, she should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she purchased the life insurance policy.\nB. guilty, because she intended to kill her husband.\nC. not guilty, because she did not perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder.\nD. not guilty, because she effectively withdrew from the criminal endeavor.\n"

This is a clear indication that she intended to kill him. The insurance policy is a substantial step in the planning of the murder.\n\n2. **Planning and Execution**: The wife planned to shoot her husband while he was asleep. This is a substantial step in the planning of the murder.\n\n3. **Confession and Reversal**: The wife confessed to her husband about her plan and begged for forgiveness. This is a substantial step in the reversal of the plan, but it does not negate the fact that she intended to kill him in the first place.\n\n4. **Effect of the Plan**: The wife's plan was to kill her husband, and she effectively carried out the plan by purchasing the insurance policy and planning the murder. This is a substantial step in the execution of the murder.\n\nTherefore, the wife should be found guilty of attempted murder because she effectively carried out the substantial step of planning and executing the murder."
