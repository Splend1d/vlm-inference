On September 23, the tenant telephoned the landlord and said, \"I want to give you the $450 and sign the two-year lease as soon as possible. \" The landlord replied, \"I've change my mind. I do not want to sign a lease with you. Moreover, I want you to vacate the apartment immediately. \" At no time after receiving the landlord's letter on September 4 did the tenant pay him the one-dollar consideration.
