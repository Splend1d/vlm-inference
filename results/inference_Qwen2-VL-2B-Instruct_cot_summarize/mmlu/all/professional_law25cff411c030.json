The state's highest court has construed the code as imposing strict and vicarious liability to the extent allowed by the federal Constitution. The evidence at trial established that the owner's company had sold contaminated meat that had sickened hundreds of consumers. It further showed, however, that the owner had been out of the country when the meat was sold and had had no reason to know that any of the meat was contaminated. The jury convicted the owner, and the court sentenced him to a large fine and probation. On appeal, the owner has challenged the sufficiency of the trial evidence. Should the appellate court uphold the conviction?\n\nA. No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's actus reus.\nB. No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's mens rea.\nC. Yes, because an appellate court cannot second-guess a jury's verdict.\nD. Yes, because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n"

The owner argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove the actus reus (the act of selling contaminated meat) and the mens rea (the intent to sell contaminated meat).\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's actus reus.**\n   - This option suggests that the evidence was not sufficient to prove that the owner actually sold the contaminated meat. However, the evidence established that the meat was sold, which is a necessary element of the actus reus. The issue is more about the intent, which the evidence did not prove.\n\nB. **No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's mens rea.**\n   - This option suggests that the evidence was not sufficient to prove that the owner had the intent to sell contaminated meat. However, the evidence established that the meat was sold, which is a necessary element of the mens rea. The issue is more about the actus reus, which the evidence did not prove.\n\nC. **Yes, because an appellate court cannot second-guess a jury's verdict.**\n   - This option suggests that the appellate court should uphold the conviction because the jury's verdict is final and cannot be second-guessed. However, the issue is about the sufficiency of the evidence, not the correctness of the jury's verdict.\n\nD. **Yes, because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.**\n   - This option suggests that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict, which is the primary concern. The evidence established that the meat was sold, which is a necessary element of the actus reus. The issue is more about the intent, which the evidence did not prove.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.**\n\nThe evidence established that the meat was sold, which is a necessary element of the actus reus. The issue is more about the intent, which the evidence did not prove."
