I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J. Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" 1898\nWhich of the following rationales does Beveridge employ in his argument?\n\nA. The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.\nB. Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine which rationale Beveridge employs in his argument, let's analyze the context and core of his statement.\n\nAlbert J. Beveridge's argument is centered around the idea that the United States should govern less developed nations, particularly the Philippines, with a just and humanizing government. He argues that the Philippines, like other less developed nations, have a right to self-governance and that the United States has a moral duty to respect and protect their sovereignty.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.**\n   - This option suggests that the United States' expansion is driven by external factors, which is not the main focus of Beveridge's argument. His argument is more about the moral duty to govern less developed nations rather than the expansion of the United States.\n\nB. **Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.**\n   - This option is irrelevant to Beveridge's argument. His argument is about the moral duty to govern less developed nations, not about economic benefits.\n\nC. **Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.**\n   - This option aligns well with Beveridge's argument. He argues that the United States has a moral duty to govern the Philippines and other less developed nations, emphasizing the importance of respecting their sovereignty and self-governance.\n\nD. **Racial superiority confers responsibility to the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations.**\n   - This option is not supported by Beveridge's argument. His argument is about the moral duty to govern less developed nations, not about racial superiority or responsibility.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the rationale that best fits Beveridge's argument is:\n\n**C. Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C."
