This means that we are 95% confident that the true difference in mean cholesterol level lowering between the two drugs lies between 18 and 41 points.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Niacin lowers cholesterol an average of 18 points, while Lipitor lowers cholesterol an average of 41 points.\n- This statement is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide a range for the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering. It only gives an estimate of the difference.\n\nB. There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\n- This statement is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide a probability. It only provides an estimate of the difference.\n\nC.

It only gives an estimate of the difference.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This statement is correct because the confidence interval does not provide a range for the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering, and it does not provide a probability.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\nD. None of the above."
