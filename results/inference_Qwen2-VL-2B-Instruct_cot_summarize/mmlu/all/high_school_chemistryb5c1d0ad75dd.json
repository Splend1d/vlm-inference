This means that the equilibrium concentration of BrCl is 15 times the initial concentration of BrCl.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial concentration of BrCl = 10.0 g / 15.0 L = 0.67 mol/L\n- K = 15.0\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentration of BrCl will be:\n\\[ \\text{Concentration of BrCl} = \\frac{\\text{Initial concentration of BrCl}}{\\text{Equilibrium constant}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Concentration of BrCl} = \\frac{0.67 \\text{ mol/L}}{15.0} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Concentration of BrCl} = 0.0467 \\text{ mol/L} \\]\n\nTherefore, the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium is 0.0467 mol/L, which is approximately 4.67 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.
