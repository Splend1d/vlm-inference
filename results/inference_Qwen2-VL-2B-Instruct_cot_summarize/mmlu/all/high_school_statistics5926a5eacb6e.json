This principle states that the probability of an event occurring is the sum of the probabilities of the event occurring without any restrictions, minus the probability of the event occurring given that another event has occurred.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P(A) \\) as the probability of a patient being diagnosed with Condition A.\n- \\( P(B|A) \\) as the probability of a patient being diagnosed with Condition B given that they are diagnosed with Condition A.\n- \\( P(B|\u00acA) \\) as the probability of a patient being diagnosed with Condition B given that they are not diagnosed with Condition A.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P(A) = 0.15 \\)\n- \\( P(B|A) = 0.70 \\)\n- \\( P(B|\u00acA) = 0.10 \\)\n\nWe need to find \\( P(A \\cup B) \\), which is the probability of a patient being diagnosed with at least one of these conditions.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( P(A \\cap B) \\), the probability of a patient being diagnosed with both Conditions A and B. This can be found using the formula:\n\\[ P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ P(A \\cap B) = 0.15 \\times 0.70 = 0.105 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate \\( P(A \\cup B) \\):\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = 0.15 + 0.70 - 0.105 = 0.855 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a patient with these symptoms will be diagnosed with at least one of these conditions is \\( 0.855 \\), which corresponds to option D."
