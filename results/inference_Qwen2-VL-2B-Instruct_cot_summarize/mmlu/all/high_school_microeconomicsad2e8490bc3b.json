I and II.\n\nIn perfect competition, the demand curve is horizontal, which means that the price (P) equals the marginal revenue (MR) because the marginal revenue is equal to the price. This is because in perfect competition, there are many buyers and sellers, and each firm's output is determined by the price of the good, which is the same as the marginal revenue.\n\nIn imperfect competition, such as monopoly or oligopoly, the demand curve is downward sloping, which means that the price (P) is greater than the marginal revenue (MR). This is because in these markets, there are fewer buyers and sellers, and each firm's output is determined by the price of the good, which is higher than the marginal revenue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. I and II."
