Document the assessed level of control risk.\n\nThe auditor's knowledge about the design of relevant internal control activities is crucial for assessing the level of control risk. This involves evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls to determine whether they are adequate to prevent or detect material misstatements. By understanding the design of internal controls, the auditor can assess the likelihood and magnitude of misstatements that could occur, thereby providing a basis for setting appropriate audit objectives and planning the audit procedures accordingly."
