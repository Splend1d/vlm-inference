In this case, the wage paid to all units of labor is $4.50.\n\nGiven that the wage is $4.50, we can calculate the number of units of labor hired by dividing the total wage by the wage rate per unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of units of labor} = \\frac{\\text{Total wage}}{\\text{Wage per unit}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of units of labor} = \\frac{4.50}{4.50} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of units of labor} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1"
