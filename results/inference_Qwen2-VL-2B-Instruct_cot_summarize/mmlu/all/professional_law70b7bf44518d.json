After the son was arrested and given Miranda warnings, he confessed and admitted that he and his father took part in the bank robbery. The prosecution decided to charge the father and son in the same indictment and prosecute them together in a single trial. At trial, the son took the stand and recanted his earlier confession by denying participation in the robbery. The prosecution now seeks to introduce into evidence the son's earlier confession that was videotaped by the police. The son and the father both object to its admissibility. The confession should be\n\nA. admitted against the son only.\nB. admitted against both the son and the father, because they were engaged in a conspiracy.\nC. not admitted against the son or the father, because the confession is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. not admitted against the son or the father, because the son recanted the confession.\n"

The son's recantation of his earlier confession is not a sufficient reason to exclude the confession from evidence. The prosecution has the burden of proving that the son's confession was coerced or made under duress, which is not the case here. The prosecution has not shown that the son was coerced or made under duress, and the son's recantation does not negate the validity of the confession. Therefore, the confession should be admitted against the son only. Therefore, the answer is A."
