In this case, the allele for the X-linked recessive disorder is X^-. Therefore, the probability of an affected individual inheriting the allele from their father is 1/2 (since the allele is X^-, the probability of inheriting it from the mother is 1/2). The probability of an affected individual inheriting the allele from their mother is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of an affected individual inheriting the allele from both parents is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. Since the allele is X^-, the probability of an affected individual inheriting the allele from their father is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of an affected individual inheriting the allele from their mother is also 1/2.
