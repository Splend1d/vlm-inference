However, the act of renting a boat for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In scenario 2, the main character is putting candy-coated pills on a low shelf, which is also morally wrong. However, this is a more subtle form of morally wrong behavior, as it involves a decision to put the pills in a location where they might be accessible to others, which is not as clear-cut as the act of renting a boat for the purpose of sexual activity."
