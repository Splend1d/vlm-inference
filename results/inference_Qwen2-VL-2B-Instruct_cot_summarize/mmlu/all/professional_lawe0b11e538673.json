She signed a simple consent form allowing an appendectomy to be performed, and giving the surgeon the right to respond to any life-threatening conditions that required immediate surgical intervention . During surgery, the surgeon performed a full hysterectomy because he felt that it would be a sound medical procedure under the circumstances, even though no emergency existed. The patient sued the surgeon. An expert testified that the surgeon committed no negligence in performing the operation. Does the patient have a valid theory of recovery against the surgeon?\n\nA. No, she cannot recover where there is no negligence by the surgeon.\nB. Yes, she can claim a lack of informed consent as to the hysterectomy.\nC. No, her consent implied that the doctor could perform any other procedures that were necessary.\nD. Yes, she can recover on a theory of trespass beyond the bodily parameters.\n"

                    "text": "The patient's theory of recovery against the surgeon is most likely based on the concept of \"trespass beyond the bodily parameters.\" This theory suggests that the surgeon's actions were not within the scope of his professional duties and therefore constitute a breach of duty.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Negligence**: The patient claims that the surgeon committed no negligence in performing the operation. This is a standard defense in medical negligence cases. If the surgeon performed a full hysterectomy without any emergency conditions, it would be considered a breach of the standard of care.\n\n2. **Informed Consent**: The patient argues that she had signed a consent form allowing for an appendectomy. However, the surgeon performed a full hysterectomy, which was not included in the consent form. This is a breach of the implied consent doctrine, which holds that a patient cannot be bound by a consent form if it does not cover all the procedures that are necessary or reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n3. **Trespass Beyond the Bodily Parameters**: The patient argues that the surgeon's actions were beyond the scope of his professional duties. This theory suggests that the surgeon's actions were not within the bounds of his medical expertise and therefore constitute a breach of duty.\n\nGiven these points, the patient has a valid theory of recovery against the surgeon. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, she can recover on a theory of trespass beyond the bodily parameters."
