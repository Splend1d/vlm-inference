Smaller cells have a smaller surface-to-volume ratio.\n\nThis is because the surface area of a cell is proportional to its volume, and the smaller the cell, the larger the surface-to-volume ratio. This means that a smaller cell has a greater surface area for its volume, which can lead to increased cell surface area-to-volume ratio, allowing for more efficient exchange of materials and energy."
