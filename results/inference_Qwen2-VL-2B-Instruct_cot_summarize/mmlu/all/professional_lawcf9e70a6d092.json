The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned \"all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants\" to a municipal corporation, the city. The community association was then terminated. A chef, the owner of lot 18 in the residential development, proposes to convert his single-family dwelling into a massage parlor. The city asserts an action against the chef to recover money damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the chef?\n\nA. The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.\nB. The city is not in privity of estate with community association.\nC. The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.\nD. The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.\n"

The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that the burden of a restriction (in this case, the restriction on the use of the lot for trade, commerce, or business) cannot be shifted to the benefit of the person who is violating the restriction (the chef). The chef is the one who is violating the restriction, and therefore, the burden of the restriction cannot be shifted to the benefit of the chef."
