Command, sovereign and enforceability\n\nAustin's theory of law, known as Legal Realism, emphasizes that law is a social construct that is created and enforced by the state. It is based on the idea that law is a set of rules that are imposed by the state on the people, and that these rules are enforceable by the state. Therefore, the attributes of law that are most accurately described by Austin are command, sovereign, and enforceability."
