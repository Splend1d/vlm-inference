We should accept a prerogative to decline radical changes to one's practical identity.\n- This option aligns with the idea that we should accept a prerogative to decline radical changes to our practical identity, which is a reasonable argument for accepting a prerogative to end a pregnancy until the fetus is considered a person.\n\nB. Abortion is absolutely morally wrong.\n- This option is too broad and does not directly address the argument about the moral status of abortion. It does not provide a reason for accepting a prerogative to end a pregnancy until the fetus is considered a person.\n\nC. Abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases.\n- This option is more nuanced and acknowledges that abortion is morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases. However, it does not directly address the argument about the moral status of abortion.\n\nD. There is no clear answer about the moral status of abortion.\n- This option is too broad and does not directly address the argument about the moral status of abortion. It does not provide a reason for accepting a prerogative to end a pregnancy until the fetus is considered a person.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most relevant and logical argument is:\n\nA. We should accept a prerogative to decline radical changes to one's practical identity.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is A."
