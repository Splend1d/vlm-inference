Firms earn long-run economic profits.\n\nIn monopolistic competition, firms are not always profitable, but they can earn long-run economic profits if demand is elastic and the industry is not highly concentrated. This is because firms have the ability to differentiate their products and advertise, which can lead to higher prices and profits. However, in the long run, the market is allocatively efficient if the industry is not highly concentrated and there is free entry and exit."
