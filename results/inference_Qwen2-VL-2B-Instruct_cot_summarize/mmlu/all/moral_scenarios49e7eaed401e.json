This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves physical harm and aggression. In scenario 2, the main character brought their 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic animals. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a decision made by a parent to bring their child to a show, which is generally considered a safe and appropriate activity for children."
