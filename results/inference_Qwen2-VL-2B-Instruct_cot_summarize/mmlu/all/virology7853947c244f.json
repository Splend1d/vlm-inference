HIV is a complex virus that has evolved to become resistant to many drugs. By using combinations of drugs, the virus is exposed to multiple targets and is less likely to develop resistance to the drugs. This helps to prolong the effectiveness of the treatment and reduce the risk of the virus becoming resistant to the drugs."
