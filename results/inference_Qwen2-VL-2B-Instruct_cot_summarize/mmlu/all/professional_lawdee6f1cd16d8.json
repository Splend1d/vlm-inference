The city council has enacted an ordinance requiring illegal aliens to pay a $100 \"school fee\" for each child enrolled in a city public school. Citizens and legal aliens are not required to pay the school fee. The city council has enacted this law to raise funds to hire additional teachers who are bilingual. The city determined that over 15% of children attending public schools in the city were illegal aliens. Furthermore, the city conducted a study and found that the overwhelming majority of illegal aliens residing in the city did not pay any local property taxes. As a result, since the city provided educational benefits to the children of illegal aliens, the school fee furthered a significant governmental interest. The illegal alien, who is indigent, is unable to pay the city school fee. The city will not allow her children to attend school unless the fee is paid. If she seeks your legal advice regarding the constitutionality of the fee, you should advise her that the ordinance is\n\nA. valid, because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.\nB. valid, because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nC. invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\nD. invalid, because the cost of educating the children imposed an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers.\n"

This principle requires that the fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest. In this case, the city's interest in providing bilingual teachers is a compelling governmental interest because it is essential for the city's educational mission and the children's educational benefits. The city's ability to demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further this interest is a critical aspect of the ordinance's constitutionality."
