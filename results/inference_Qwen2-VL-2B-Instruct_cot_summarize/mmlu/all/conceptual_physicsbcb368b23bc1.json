                    "text": "The force on the ball is given by Newton's second law, F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. In this case, the force is the net force, which is the difference between the force of gravity and the force of air resistance.\n\nThe force of gravity is given by mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2). The force of air resistance is given by F_a = -k * (v^2), where k is a constant and v is the velocity of the ball.\n\nAt the 10-m position, the ball has just reached the halfway point of its ascent. At this point, the velocity of the ball is v = sqrt(2 * g * h), where h is the height of the ball. Substituting this into the equation for F_a gives F_a = -k * (sqrt(2 * g * 10))^2 = -k * 200.\n\nThe net force on the ball is the difference between the force of gravity and the force of air resistance, so F_net = mg - F_a = mg - k * 200 = mg - 200k.\n\nAt the 10-m position, the net force on the ball is F_net = mg - 200k. Since the ball is moving upward, the net force is negative, so we can say that the net force on the ball is mg - 200k.\n\nNow, we can use the equation for F_net to find the force of air resistance at the 10-m position. Substituting the values we know into the equation gives F_net = mg - 200k = mg - 200 * 200 = mg - 40000.\n\nTherefore, the force of air resistance at the 10-m position is mg - 40000. Since the force of air resistance is negative, we can say that the force of air resistance at the 10-m position is -40000.\n\nNow, we can use the equation for F_net to find the force of air resistance at the 10-m position. Substituting the values we know into the equation gives F_net = mg - 200k = mg - 200 * 200 = mg - 40000.\n\nTherefore, the force of air resistance at the 10-m position is mg - 40000. Since the force of air resistance is negative, we can say that the force of air resistance at the 10-m position is -40000.\n\nNow, we can use the equation for F_net to find the force of air resistance at the 10-m position.
