Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nThe poem provides evidence of which of the following as a major cause of later Tang decline?\n\nA. Discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive taxation\nB. Foreign invasion of the Tang heartlands\nC. The spread of Buddhism and Taoism as a reaction to state-sponsored Confucianism\nD. An ineffective bureaucracy and poor leadership\n"
