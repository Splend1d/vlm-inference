The nuclei of comets disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central location in the sky.\n\nComets are small icy bodies that orbit the Sun. When a comet enters Earth's atmosphere, its nucleus, which is made of ice, is heated by the friction of the atmosphere. This heating causes the nucleus to break apart into smaller pieces, which are then scattered throughout the Earth's atmosphere. These pieces of ice and dust create the bright meteors that we see in meteor showers."
