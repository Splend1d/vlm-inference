The argument starts by stating that the sense of a term is supposed to determine its reference.\n2. It then argues that reference can vary without any difference in thought, implying that the senses of terms can vary without variation in thought.\n3. Finally, it concludes that our thoughts do not determine the meanings of our terms; meanings are not in the head.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The sense of a term is supposed to determine its reference.\n   - This is a premise of the argument, not the conclusion.\n\nB. But reference can vary without any difference in thought.\n   - This is a premise of the argument, not the conclusion.\n\nC. Reference can vary without any difference in thought.\n   - This is a premise of the argument, not the conclusion.\n\nD. Our thoughts do not determine the meanings of our terms; meanings are not in the head.\n   - This is the conclusion of the argument, as it summarizes the main point of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is:\n\nD. Our thoughts do not determine the meanings of our terms; meanings are not in the head."
