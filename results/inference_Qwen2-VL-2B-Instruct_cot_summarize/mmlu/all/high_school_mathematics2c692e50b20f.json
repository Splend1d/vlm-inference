The first half is 26.2 miles / 2 = 13.1 miles, and the second half is also 13.1 miles.\n\nJennifer runs the first half at 8 mph, so the time it takes for her to run the first half is 13.1 miles / 8 mph = 1.6575 hours.\n\nShe runs the second half at 6 mph, so the time it takes for her to run the second half is 13.1 miles / 6 mph = 2.1833 hours.\n\nAdding the times together, the total time it takes for Jennifer to complete the marathon is 1.6575 hours + 2.1833 hours = 3.83078 hours.\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, it takes approximately 3.82 hours for Jennifer to complete the marathon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3.82."
