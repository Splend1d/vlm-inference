She testified at trial that while sitting on the floor trying to gather the strength to get up, she heard a grocery employee asst. manager say to an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" The grocer's counsel objected on the basis of hearsay to the admissibility of the purported statements of the asst. manager and the other employee. What will the court decide?\n\nA. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay \u0080\u0094 it was offered to show that they were aware of a problem on the floor.\nB. The objection will be sustained because the asst. manager's statement was pure hearsay and she had to be available for cross-examination for the statement to be admissible.\nC. The objection will be sustained because the statement was irrelevant to whether or not the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries.\nD. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n"

This is hearsay because it is not a statement made in the course of creating or testifying at a trial. Hearsay is not admissible in court unless it is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n2. **Cross-Examination**: The asst. manager had to be available for cross-examination to establish the truth of the statement. This is necessary to determine whether the statement was made in the course of creating or testifying at a trial.\n\n3. **Admissibility**: The statement was not admissible because it was offered to show that the asst. manager was aware of a problem on the floor, which is hearsay and not relevant to the issue of negligence and liability for the shopper's injuries.\n\nTherefore, the court will sustain the objection and rule that the asst. manager's statement is hearsay and must be excluded from the trial."
