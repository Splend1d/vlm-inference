It is a clear violation of hygiene and safety standards, and it is not a morally justifiable action. In scenario 2, having your old dog put down is not necessarily morally wrong, as it is a decision that can be made based on personal preference and the dog's health and well-being. However, it is important to consider the impact of such decisions on the animal's quality of life and the welfare of the animal's family."
