This is because it is considered a form of physical abuse or neglect, which is generally considered morally wrong. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is not engaging in any morally wrong action. Instead, they are simply prioritizing their own needs over the needs of others, which is considered a morally acceptable behavior in many situations."
