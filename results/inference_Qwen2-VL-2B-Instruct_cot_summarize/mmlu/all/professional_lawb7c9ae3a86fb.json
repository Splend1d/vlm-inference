The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?\n\nA. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\nB. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\nD. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court will enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship**: In a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, the property is owned by the joint tenants jointly, but upon the death of one of the tenants, the property passes to the surviving tenant. This means that the right of survivorship is a legal right that is not extinguished by the death of one of the joint tenants.\n\n2. **Judgment Note**: A judgment note is a legal document that secures a debt by placing a lien on the property of the debtor. When a judgment note is entered against a tenant's interest in the property, it does not automatically extinguish the tenant's right to the property. The lien remains in effect until the debt is paid or the lien is discharged.\n\n3. **Assent to the Judgment Note**: The second cousin's assent to the judgment note was presumed by law to destroy the joint tenancy. However, this presumption does not automatically extinguish the right of survivorship. The right of survivorship is a legal right that is not extinguished by the death of one of the joint tenants.\n\n4. **Sale of Property**: The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. This defense is based on the assumption that the lien was extinguished by the death of the first cousin.\n\n5. **Interference with Property Rights**: The second cousin's defense is based on the assumption that the lien was extinguished by the death of the first cousin. This assumption is not necessarily correct, as the lien remains in effect until the debt is paid or the lien is discharged.\n\nGiven these points, the court will likely not enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin. The assumption that the lien was extinguished by the death of the first cousin is not necessarily correct, and the lien remains in effect until the debt is paid or the lien is discharged.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights."
