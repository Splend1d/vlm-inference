Worker empowerment refers to the ability of workers to make decisions and take control of their work environment. This can include things like the ability to choose how they want to work, the ability to choose their own tasks, and the ability to choose their own work hours. Worker empowerment can lead to increased productivity and satisfaction among workers, as well as a more positive work environment."
