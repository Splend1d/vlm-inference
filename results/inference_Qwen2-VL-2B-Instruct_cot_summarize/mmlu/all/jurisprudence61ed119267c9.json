Punishment should fit the crime.\n\nConsequentialist theories of punishment argue that the most effective way to deter crime is to punish those who commit it, as this will deter others from committing similar acts. Punishment is seen as a way to prevent crime and protect personal safety, rather than as a means of retribution or to punish individuals for their actions. Therefore, the idea that punishment should fit the crime is inconsistent with a consequentialist justification of punishment."
