After losing a large amount of money, the defendants accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, the defendants beat him with their fists and, as the victim fell to the ground, they continued by kicking him in the head. The victim suffered a fractured skull in the beating and died as a result of severe head trauma. Thereafter, the defendants reached into the victim's pocket and stole his wallet. The defendants were arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. Prior to trial, the prosecutor admitted that it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for actually fracturing the victim's skull. If the defendants are prosecuted for felony murder, which of the following would provide their best defense?\n\nA. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement.\nB. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory.\nD. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n"

                    "text": "The jurisdiction in this case would likely fall under the independent felony murder rule, which is a legal doctrine that allows for the prosecution of a defendant for the death of another person if the defendant's actions were the proximate cause of the death. This means that the defendant's actions were the direct cause of the death, and the death was a result of the defendant's actions.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Jurisdiction**: The jurisdiction in this case would likely be based on the independent felony murder rule, as the death of the victim was caused by the defendants' actions, which were the proximate cause of the death.\n\n2. **Proximate Cause**: The prosecution would argue that the defendants' actions were the proximate cause of the death, meaning that the defendants' actions directly caused the death of the victim.\n\n3. **Agency Theory**: The agency theory would not be relevant here because the defendants' actions were the proximate cause of the death, not the result of the defendants' agency.\n\n4. **Inherently Dangerous Felony Requirement**: The inherently dangerous felony requirement would not apply here because the death was caused by the defendants' actions, not by the inherent danger of the felony itself.\n\nTherefore, the best defense for the defendants would be:\n\n**B. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.**"
