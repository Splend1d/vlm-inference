Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.\n\"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.\n\"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.\"\n\u2014Excerpted and adapted from the Shu Jing, 6th century BCE, China\nWhich phrase can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs?\n\nA.
