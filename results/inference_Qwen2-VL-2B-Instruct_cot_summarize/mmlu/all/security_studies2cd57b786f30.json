Technological developments do not affect the majority of the world's population and so the advancement of telecommunications and digital media are not of concern to peace studies.\nB. Digital information, media, and communications technology is likely to inspire greater harmony in the international system as the global population learns more about the world in which they live, and the lives of others around them.\nC. With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.\nD. Technological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players, and to reinforce the status quo of international relations.\n"

With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.\n\nTechnological change and development can have significant implications for peace studies, particularly in terms of how it affects the distribution of power and resources within the international system. The rise of digital information and media has the potential to empower marginalized populations and increase their awareness of the inequalities and injustices of the global system. This can lead to widespread frustration and a desire for change, which could potentially lead to revolutions or other forms of social and political upheaval. However, it is important to note that the impact of technological change and development on peace and stability is complex and multifaceted, and will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific context and circumstances in which it occurs."
