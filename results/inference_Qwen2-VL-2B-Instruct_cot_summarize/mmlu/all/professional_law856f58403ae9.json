Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2002, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. By 2007, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2008, a man who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder placed a mobile home on his property. A woman who owns a lot in the subdivision initiates suit against the man to force him to remove the mobile home. Which of the following would be the most accurate statement of law?\n\nA. There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not \"run with the land. \"\nB. There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\nC. The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\nD. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n"

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the options provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Context and Core of the Question**: The developer restricted mobile homes in the subdivision, and the man placed a mobile home on his lot. The question asks for the most accurate statement of law regarding the enforceability of this restriction.\n\n2. **Understand the Context**: The developer restricted mobile homes in the subdivision, but the man placed a mobile home on his lot. This creates a situation where the restriction is not being enforced.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not 'run with the land.'\"\n     - This option suggests that the restriction did not apply to the man's property because it was not part of the original subdivision plan. However, the restriction was imposed on the entire subdivision, not just the man's lot. This option is not accurate.\n   - **Option B**: \"There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\"\n     - This option suggests that the restriction was not enforced because the man did not include the provision in his deed. However, the restriction was imposed on the entire subdivision, not just the man's lot. This option is not accurate.\n   - **Option C**: \"The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\"\n     - This option suggests that the restriction was enforceable because the developer had established a common development scheme for the entire subdivision. However, the restriction was imposed on the man's lot, not the entire subdivision. This option is not accurate.\n   - **Option D**: \"The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\"\n     - This option correctly identifies that the outcome of the case depends on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision. If the developer had organized a common development scheme for the entire subdivision, the restriction would be enforceable. If not, it would not be enforceable.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The most accurate statement of law is that the outcome of the case depends on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n\n**Final Answer**: D. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision."
