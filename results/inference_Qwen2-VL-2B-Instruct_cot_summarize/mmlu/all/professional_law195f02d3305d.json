Therefore, the defendant must be brought to trial within 90 days of December 1, which is January 1. Since the defendant was released on March 1, the 90-day period ends on March 1, and the defendant must be brought to trial within 90 days of that date.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- Option B is incorrect because the defendant was released on March 1, not jail.\n- Option C is incorrect because the defendant must be brought to trial within 90 days of the filing of the motion to discharge, not within 10 days of the hearing.\n- Option D is incorrect because the defendant must be brought to trial within 90 days of the filing of the motion to discharge, not within 10 days of the hearing."
