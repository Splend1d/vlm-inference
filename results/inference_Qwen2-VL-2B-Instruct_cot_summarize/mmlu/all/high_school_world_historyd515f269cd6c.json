The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph?\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\nD. World War II\n"

The passage discusses the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and his subsequent arrest, followed by his continued efforts to address a meeting outside the station.\n2. The main message is about the importance of non-violent resistance and the need to remain united despite the arrest.\n3. The final paragraph emphasizes the importance of boycotts and the need to earn imprisonment to achieve the goal of Swaraj (freedom) and redress of wrongs.\n\nGiven this context, the historical development that most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott is:\n\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\n\nThis is because the passage mentions the arrest of Gandhi and his subsequent efforts to address a meeting, which suggests a focus on non-violent resistance and unity. The decolonization process in Africa was already underway, and the boycott could have been a part of the broader movement against colonialism and the need for independence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa"
