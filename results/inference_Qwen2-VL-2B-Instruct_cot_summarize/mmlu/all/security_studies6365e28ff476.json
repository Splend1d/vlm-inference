In no-win situations therefore the adversary might calculate that temporary compliance is the best strategic option to buy time.\nB. Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise. Actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive their vital interests as threatened and regard issues as zero-sum because they are aware that force will be used. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions.\nC. The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success.\nD. The political scope for offering inducements can become unlimited. The problem becomes particularly underlined when the risk of terrorism, WMD or equal military capability comes into play. Inducements can appear to look like concessionary politics and blur the line of what constitutes a success defined as the fear of inescapable escalation.\n"

This can be difficult to achieve, especially in situations where the adversary has a strong sense of national pride or a desire to maintain its independence. Additionally, coercive diplomacy can be difficult to sustain over the long term, as it requires a commitment from both sides to the terms of the agreement. This can be difficult to achieve in situations where the adversary has a strong sense of national pride or a desire to maintain its independence."
