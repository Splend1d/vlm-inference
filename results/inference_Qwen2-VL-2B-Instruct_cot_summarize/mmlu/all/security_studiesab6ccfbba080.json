All of these options.\n\nThe 'energy security nexus' refers to the interplay between energy production, distribution, and consumption, and the geopolitical dynamics that arise from these activities. It involves the competition for energy resources, the development of energy infrastructure, and the potential for conflict over access to these resources. This interplay can lead to geopolitical rivalries and the emergence of new forms of cooperation, as well as the potential for international security implications."
