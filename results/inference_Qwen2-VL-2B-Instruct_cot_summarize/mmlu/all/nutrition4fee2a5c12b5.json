A reduction in lean body mass: This can occur due to muscle atrophy, which is a loss of muscle mass and strength. This can lead to a decrease in the amount of energy required to perform daily activities.\n\nB. A reduction in physical activity: Physical activity is essential for maintaining energy expenditure. As people age, they may become less active, leading to a decrease in energy expenditure.\n\nC. A reduction in basal metabolic rate: The basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy the body uses to maintain basic functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. As people age, their basal metabolic rate may decrease, leading to a decrease in energy expenditure.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors contribute to reduced energy expenditure in older adults."
