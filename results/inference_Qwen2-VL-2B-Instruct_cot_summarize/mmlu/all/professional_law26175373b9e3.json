The key point here is that the victim believed that her death was imminent, and the witness's testimony is based on that belief. \n\nThe court should rule that the witness's testimony is admissible as a dying declaration because the victim's belief that she was about to die is relevant to the issue of whether the defendant committed the murder. The court should also consider the probative value of the testimony and the risk of unfair prejudice, but these factors are not determinative in this case. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent."
