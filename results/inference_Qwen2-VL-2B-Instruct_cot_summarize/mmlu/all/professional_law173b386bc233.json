                    "text": "Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.\nB. The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\nC. Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\nD. Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\n"

Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Statute Analysis**: The statute states that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. This means that the act of detonating the bomb is a crime, regardless of whether the co-defendants intended to kill anyone.\n\n2. **Intervening Cause**: The investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. This means that the explosion was caused by an independent event, not the co-defendants' actions.\n\n3. **Gross Negligence**: The casino's failure to heed the telephone warning constitutes gross negligence. Gross negligence is a legal doctrine that absolves a party from liability if they were not aware of a significant risk and failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the explosion was caused by an independent event (a faulty wire), the casino's gross negligence is the independent intervening cause that led to the explosion. Therefore, the co-defendants are not guilty of violating the statute.\n\nThus, the correct statement is C."
