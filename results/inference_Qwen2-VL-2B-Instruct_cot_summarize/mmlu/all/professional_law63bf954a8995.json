During the trial, a physician who was treating the plaintiff testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice, which had been there for several days, was at least two inches thick. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked the physician the following question: \"During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?\"\n\nThe plaintiff's attorney objected to the physician's testimony, arguing that the defendant's counsel had failed to lay a proper foundation for the physician's testimony. The court will rule on this objection based on the relevance of the physician's testimony to the plaintiff's injuries.\n\nOption A: Admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\nThis option is incorrect because the physician's testimony is not relevant to proving that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated. The physician's testimony is relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injuries, not to the plaintiff's allegations of false or exaggerated injuries.\n\nOption B: Admissible, because the physician had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's injuries.\nThis option is incorrect because the physician's testimony is not relevant to proving that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated. The physician's testimony is relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injuries, not to the plaintiff's allegations of false or exaggerated injuries.\n\nOption C: Inadmissible, because the defendant's counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.\nThis option is incorrect because the physician's testimony is relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injuries, not to the plaintiff's allegations of false or exaggerated injuries. The physician's testimony is relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injuries, not to the plaintiff's allegations of false or exaggerated injuries.\n\nOption D: Inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.\nThis option is correct because the physician's testimony is relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injuries, not to the plaintiff's allegations of false or exaggerated injuries. The physician's testimony is relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injuries, not to the plaintiff's allegations of false or exaggerated injuries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
