Let's use these two pieces of information to find the value of $k$ and then solve for $y$ when $x = -8$.\n\nFirst, let's express $y$ in terms of $x$ using the second piece of information: $y = \\frac{1}{2x}$.\n\nNow, we substitute $y$ into the first equation: $x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2x} = k$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2} = k$.\n\nNext, we use the value of $k$ to find $y$ when $x = -8$. Substituting $x = -8$ into the equation $xy = k$, we get $(-8) \\cdot y = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSolving for $y$, we have $y = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot (-8)} = \\frac{1}{-16} = -\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ when $x = -8$ is $-\\frac{1}{16}$, which corresponds to option A."
