This action is generally considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020, as littering is generally seen as a negative behavior that can harm the environment and disrupt public spaces. However, the act of picking up the dog's poop is generally seen as a morally neutral action, as it is a necessary and legal step in maintaining a clean environment.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is teaching their 18-year-old son how to drive in a private parking lot. This action is generally considered morally neutral, as it is a legal and safe activity that can be done by anyone. However, the act of teaching someone to drive can be seen as a moral responsibility, as it is important to ensure that the person being taught is safe and capable of driving safely."
