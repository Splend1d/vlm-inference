It is the radius of a sphere that, if placed at the center of a black hole, would cause all objects within that sphere to be pulled towards the black hole, regardless of their mass. The Schwarzschild radius is a key parameter in understanding the properties of black holes, such as their mass, spin, and the strength of the gravitational field."
