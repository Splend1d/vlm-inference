According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, killing an animal, especially a pet, is generally considered morally wrong. The act of killing a living being is seen as a violation of the animal's rights and can have long-lasting consequences for the animal's well-being.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character laughed at a juggling clown. This action is generally considered morally wrong as well. Laughing at someone who is performing a skillful and entertaining act is seen as disrespectful and insensitive. It can be seen as a form of bullying or exploitation, which is also morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
