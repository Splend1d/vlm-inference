To coat the proteins with a large positive charge, since amino acid side chains may have positive, negative, or neutral charges, and a large uniform charge is necessary to get good separation in the gel.\nB. To allow the electrophoresis to separate the proteins solely on the basis of the length of the primary sequence.\nC. To prevent the protein from denaturing so that the electrophoresis can accurately resolve the proteins on the basis of tertiary structure.\nD. To break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together, thereby generating linear fragments that may be sorted on size.\n"

To break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together, thereby generating linear fragments that may be sorted on size.\n\nIn SDS-PAGE, proteins are treated with a detergent (SDS) to denature them. Denaturation is the process of breaking the tertiary and primary structures of proteins, which allows them to be separated based on size. This is because the detergent disrupts the hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions that hold the proteins together, allowing them to migrate through the gel based on their size."
