If the trait reaps the best return for the cost relative to alternative forms of the trait, that trait will win out over the alternative forms.\n\nThis idea is rooted in the concept of evolutionary advantage, which posits that traits that confer a higher return on investment (such as increased fitness or reproductive success) will be more likely to be passed on to future generations. This is because the organism that possesses the trait is more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on the trait to its offspring."
