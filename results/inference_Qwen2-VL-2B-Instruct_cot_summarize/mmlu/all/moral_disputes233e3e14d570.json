He would say this begs the question because the immigration question is identical to the freedom-of-movement question.\n- This option suggests that Wellman is responding to the objection by saying that the objection is a red herring. However, this does not directly address the core of the objection that the right to freedom of movement is not a fundamental right.\n\nB. He would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement.\n- This option directly addresses the core of the objection by arguing that there is no right to freedom of movement. If Wellman were to argue that there is no right to freedom of movement, he would be directly addressing the objection that he is essentially denying that we have a right to freedom of movement.\n\nC. He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner).\n- This option is about the nature of certain rights, but it does not directly address the core of the objection that the right to freedom of movement is not a fundamental right.\n\nD. He would use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable.\n- This option is about moral reasoning and the justification of policies, but it does not directly address the core of the objection that the right to freedom of movement is not a fundamental right.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most appropriate response is:\n\nB. He would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement.\n\nFinal answer: B."
