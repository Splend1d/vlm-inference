                    "text": "To determine the FALSE statement, let's analyze each option based on the given information:\n\nA. The densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\n- The density of a gas is given by the formula \\( \\rho = \\frac{m}{V} \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the gas and \\( V \\) is its volume. Since the containers are at the same temperature and the mass of helium is less than that of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the density of helium will be the lowest. The density of nitrogen will be higher than that of carbon dioxide because nitrogen has a higher molar mass. Therefore, the density increases in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\n\nB. The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\n- The number of molecules in a gas is given by the formula \\( N = \\frac{m}{M} \\), where \\( M \\) is the molar mass of the gas. Since the mass of helium is less than that of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the number of molecules in helium will be less than that in nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Therefore, the number of molecules is not the same.\n\nC. The pressure in all three containers is the same.\n- The pressure of a gas is given by the formula \\( P = \\frac{F}{A} \\), where \\( F \\) is the force exerted by the molecules and \\( A \\) is the surface area of the container. Since the containers are the same size and at the same temperature, the pressure will be the same.\n\nD. The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\n- The average speed of a gas is given by the formula \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{8RT}{\\pi M}} \\), where \\( R \\) is the gas constant, \\( T \\) is the temperature, and \\( M \\) is the molar mass of the gas. Since the containers are at the same temperature and the mass of helium is less than that of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the average speed of the molecules will be the same.\n\nTherefore, the FALSE statement is:\n\nB. The number of molecules in all the containers is the same."
