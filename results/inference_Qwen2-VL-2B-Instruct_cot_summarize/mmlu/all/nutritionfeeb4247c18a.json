Stunting is a condition where a child's height is below the average for their age and sex. It is often associated with poor nutrition, which can lead to cognitive delays.\n\n2. **Short term cognitive performance**:\n   - This statement suggests that stunting before 24 months of age affects short-term cognitive performance. This is because stunting can lead to physical and mental health issues that can affect a child's ability to learn and perform tasks.\n\n3. **Long term cognitive performance**:\n   - This statement implies that stunting before 24 months of age affects long-term cognitive performance. However, this statement is more general and does not specify the duration of the impact. It could be that stunting affects cognitive performance for a short period or for a longer period.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**A. Childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects short term cognitive performance.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects short term cognitive performance.**"
