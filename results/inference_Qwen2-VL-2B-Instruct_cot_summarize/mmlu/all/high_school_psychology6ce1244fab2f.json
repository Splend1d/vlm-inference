In the context of the doctor's thought process, the doctor's belief that smoking is unhealthy is conflicting with his belief that he can keep smoking despite eating healthily. This discomfort or conflict is what drives the doctor to seek out solutions or explanations for his behavior, such as the one provided by cognitive dissonance."
