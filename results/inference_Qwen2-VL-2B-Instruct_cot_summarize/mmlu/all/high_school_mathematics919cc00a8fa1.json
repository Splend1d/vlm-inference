In this case, the ladder, the ground, and the building form a right triangle.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(L\\) as the length of the ladder,\n- \\(H\\) as the height of the building,\n- \\(D\\) as the distance from the foot of the ladder to the building,\n- \\(R\\) as the rate at which the top of the ladder moves down.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(L = 26\\) feet,\n- \\(D = 10\\) feet,\n- \\(R = 3\\) feet per second.\n\nWe need to find \\(H\\), the height of the building.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[L^2 = H^2 + D^2\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[26^2 = H^2 + 10^2\\]\n\\[676 = H^2 + 100\\]\n\\[H^2 = 676 - 100\\]\n\\[H^2 = 576\\]\n\\[H = \\sqrt{576}\\]\n\\[H = 24\\] feet.\n\nSo, the height of the building is 24 feet.\n\nNow, we need to find \\(r\\), the rate at which the top of the ladder moves down. Since the ladder is moving away from the building, the rate of change of \\(H\\) with respect to time is negative, and we can use the chain rule to find \\(r\\).\n\nThe rate of change of \\(H\\) with respect to time is:\n\\[H' = \\frac{dH}{dt} = -\\frac{dD}{dt}\\]\n\nGiven \\(R = 3\\) feet per second, we need to find \\(-\\frac{dD}{dt}\\).\n\nSince \\(D = 10\\) feet and \\(R = 3\\) feet per second, we have:\n\\[D' = \\frac{dD}{dt} = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the top of the ladder moves down is:\n\\[r = -\\frac{dD}{dt} = -3\\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[r = -3\\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 3/4"
