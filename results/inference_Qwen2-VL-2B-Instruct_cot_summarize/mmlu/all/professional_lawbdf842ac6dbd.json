The language was insulting and harsh, but there were no attempts to make physical contact. Inside, patients were nervous and surgical procedures were intensified under the constant sounds of taunting taking place outside. The state court issued an injunction making the protesters stand 36 feet from the entrance, which put them on the other side of the street, but within clear sight of the clinic. The restriction reasonably cleared a space for ingress and egress. Since the streets are normally considered a \"public forum\" for free speech, will the appellate courts uphold the restriction?\n\nA. Yes, because their language was insulting, the restriction would be upheld as a fair restriction of speech.\nB. Yes, the injunctive restriction was a content-neutral restriction that burdened no more speech than was necessary.\nC. No, the right to protest according to one's religious beliefs about abortion cannot be regulated under the First Amendment.\nD. No, the regulation of free speech cannot be carried out by injunctive relief.\n"

This is a form of an injunction, which is a court order that requires a party to refrain from certain actions.\n\n2. **Content-Neutral Nature**: The restriction is based on the distance from the clinic entrance, which does not impose any content on the speech of the protesters. It is a neutral measure that does not burden the speech in any way.\n\n3. **Purpose of the Restriction**: The purpose of the restriction is to maintain a clear space for ingress and egress, ensuring that the clinic can function without obstruction. This is a legitimate purpose for a court to impose an injunction.\n\nGiven these points, the restriction is a content-neutral one that does not burden the speech of the protesters. It is reasonable to expect that the appellate courts would uphold the injunction as a fair restriction of speech.\n\n**Final Answer: B. Yes, the injunctive restriction was a content-neutral restriction that burdened no more speech than was necessary.**"
