                    "text": "To determine the time required to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the given data set. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.\n\nThe formula for the standard deviation (\u03c3) is:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(\u03a3(x_i - \u03bc)\u00b2 / N)\n\nwhere:\nx_i is each individual measurement,\n\u03bc is the mean of the measurements,\nN is the total number of measurements.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean (\u03bc) of the measurements:\n\n\u03bc = (3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 10 = 2.6\n\nNext, we calculate the variance (\u03c3\u00b2):\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 = [(3-2.6)\u00b2 + (0-2.6)\u00b2 + (2-2.6)\u00b2 + (1-2.6)\u00b2 + (2-2.6)\u00b2 + (4-2.6)\u00b2 + (0-2.6)\u00b2 + (1-2.6)\u00b2 + (2-2.6)\u00b2 + (5-2.6)\u00b2] / 10\n\u03c3\u00b2 = 0.08\n\nFinally, we calculate the standard deviation (\u03c3):\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(0.08) \u2248 0.29\n\nTo establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to find the time (t) that corresponds to a standard deviation of 0.29. We can use the formula:\n\nt = \u03bc \u00b1 (\u03c3 / \u221aN)\n\nwhere:\n\u03bc is the mean of the measurements,\n\u03c3 is the standard deviation,\nN is the total number of measurements.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nt = 2.6 \u00b1 (0.29 / \u221a10)\nt = 2.6 \u00b1 0.17\n\nSince we want the uncertainty to be 1 percent, we need to find the time that corresponds to a standard deviation of 0.17. We can use the formula:\n\nt = \u03bc \u00b1 (\u03c3 / \u221aN)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nt = 2.6 \u00b1 (0.17 / \u221a10)\nt = 2.6 \u00b1 0.17\n\nSince we want the uncertainty to be 1 percent, we need to find the time that corresponds to a standard deviation of 0.17.
