The farmer decides to test H0: \u03bc = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : \u03bc > 4.0 ounces, at a 5 percent level of significance, where \u03bc = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer. The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?\n\nA. P(Z > 2)\nB. P(Z < 2)\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n"

The t-distribution is appropriate for small samples and unknown population standard deviation.\n\nThe t-distribution is symmetric around the mean, and the degrees of freedom (df) are calculated as:\n\n\\[ df = n - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15 \\]\n\nThe t-distribution table or a statistical software can be used to find the p-value for a given t-value and degrees of freedom. However, since we are asked for the p-value, we can use the t-distribution table directly.\n\nThe t-distribution table shows that the p-value for a t-value of 2 with 15 degrees of freedom is approximately 0.013.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom"
