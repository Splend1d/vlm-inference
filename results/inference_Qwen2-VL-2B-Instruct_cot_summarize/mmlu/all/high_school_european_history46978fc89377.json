While \"savage,\" they fight wars for the sake of a lasting peace.\n\nThe poem describes the British Empire as imposing its rule over native peoples, who are described as \"exiled sons\" of the British race. The British Empire is portrayed as a force that seeks to impose peace and order on the native peoples, who are depicted as fighting wars for the sake of a lasting peace. The poem also suggests that the British Empire is a force that seeks to control and dominate the native peoples, rather than to convert them to Christianity or to a less-civilized and less-developed civilization."
