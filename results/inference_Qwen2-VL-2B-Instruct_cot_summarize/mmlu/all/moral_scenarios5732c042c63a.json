According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is generally considered morally wrong to view or destroy historical artifacts, as they hold significant cultural and historical value. In scenario 2, the main character picks flowers from a ladies flower garden, which is a natural and peaceful activity. This is generally considered morally right, as it is a harmless and non-intrusive activity that does not harm anyone or cause any harm to the environment."
