The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the stadium was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. Assume that three years after the stadium had been in operation, a subsequent session of the state legislature passed a bill entirely prohibiting baseball because four players were killed in playing mishaps. This statute is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because of the clear and present danger of baseball playing in the state.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders'contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it violates the due process rights of the baseball team owners.\n"

Unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\nThe bond agreement stipulates that at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt for the first five years. If the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. This means that the bondholders would be required to make payments even if baseball is not played in the state.\n\nThe state legislature's bill prohibiting baseball is likely unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract. The bond agreement requires that the proceeds from admission charges be used to repay the bond debt, and if the proceeds are not sufficient, additional payments are required. The prohibition of baseball in the state would likely violate this obligation, as it would prevent the bondholders from receiving the necessary payments to repay their debt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract."
