The 64th percentile corresponds to a score of 64 on the test.\n3. The 56th percentile corresponds to a score of 56 on the test.\n\nGiven these scores, we can determine the following:\n\n- Mary's score is 64.\n- Pam's score is 56.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mary scored eight more points than Pam.\n- Mary's score is 64, and Pam's score is 56. Therefore, Mary scored 64 - 56 = 8 more points than Pam. This is true.\n\nB. Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\n- Mary's score is 64, and Pam's score is 56. To find 8% higher, we calculate 8% of 56 and add it to 56: (8/100) * 56 + 56 = 4.48 + 56 = 60.48. Mary's score is not 8% higher than Pam's; it is actually 4.48% higher. This is false.\n\nC. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\n- To find 8% of the total score range, we calculate 8% of (64 - 56) = 0.08 * 8 = 0.64. This means 64 - 56 = 8 is 64% of the total score range, not 8%. This is false.\n\nD. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\n- To find 36 people who scored higher than both, we calculate 36% of the total score range, which is (64 - 56) = 8. This means 8% of the total score range is 36. However, this is not possible since the total score range is 64 - 56 = 8, and 36 is not within this range. This is false.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is:\n\nA. Mary scored eight more points than Pam."
