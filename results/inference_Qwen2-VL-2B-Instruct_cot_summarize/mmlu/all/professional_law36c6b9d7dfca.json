He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:\"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. \"Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n"

This is a clear repudiation of the agreement, as it is a breach of the man's duty to fulfill his obligations under the contract.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pool.\n- This is accurate because the man has repudiated the agreement by not fulfilling his obligations.\n\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\n- This is inaccurate because the man has already repudiated the agreement, and the swimming club cannot sue him immediately.\n\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\n- This is accurate because the man has the right to retract his repudiation before the swimming club initiates legal action.\n\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n- This is inaccurate because the man has already repudiated the agreement, and the swimming club cannot wait until the next payment to sue him.\n\nTherefore, the immediate legal effect of the man's letter does not accurately state the option that does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter.\n\nThe correct answer is B."
