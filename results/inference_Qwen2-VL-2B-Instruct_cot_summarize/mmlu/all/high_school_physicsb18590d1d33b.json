After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck?\n\nA. The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.\nB. The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.\nC. The net force is in the positive direction, because the student\u2019s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.\nD. The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n"

The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n\nWhen a force is applied to an object, the net force on the object is the vector sum of the applied force and the force of friction. Since the student applied a force in the positive direction (to the right), and the force of friction acts in the opposite direction (downward), the net force on the puck is zero. This is because the net force is the vector sum of the two forces and must equal zero for equilibrium."
