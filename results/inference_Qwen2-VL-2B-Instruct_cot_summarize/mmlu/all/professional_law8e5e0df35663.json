He also knew that the tenant's actions had led to some violent confrontations in the past, including one where a gun was discharged in the hallway outside the tenant's apartment. Because the tenant regularly paid his rent on time, the owner didn't take any action to try to evict the tenant. One day, a rival drug dealer drove by the tenant's apartment and fired his gun at the tenant's front window. One of the bullets passed through the tenant's living room and went through the wall into the apartment next door. The bullet struck and injured a neighbor who occupied the adjoining apartment. If the neighbor asserts a claim against the owner to recover damages for his injury, he should\n\nA. recover, because the owner knew that the tenant was dealing drugs from his apartment.\nB. recover, because the owner was aware that such danger existed because of the tenant's drug-dealing activities.\nC. not recover, because the owner is not liable for the criminal acts of third persons.\nD. not recover, because the neighbor is outside the zone of foreseeable danger.\n"

The owner's knowledge that the tenant was dealing drugs and the violent confrontations in the past indicate that the tenant posed a danger to the neighbor's safety. The owner's failure to take action to protect the neighbor's safety is a breach of duty of care, and the neighbor has a right to recover damages for his injury.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. recover, because the owner was aware that such danger existed because of the tenant's drug-dealing activities."
