Dissection of the aorta\n\nMarfan syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by an increased risk of aortic dissection, which can lead to severe chest pain and other symptoms. The patient's history of aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation also increases the likelihood of aortic dissection. The sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain with radiating symptoms to the neck is consistent with the symptoms of aortic dissection."
