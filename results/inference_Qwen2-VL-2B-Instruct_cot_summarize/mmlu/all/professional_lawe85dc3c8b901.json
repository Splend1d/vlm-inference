                    "text": "An owner of a solar heated residence filed a lawsuit that tried to enjoin her neighbor from building a house that would totally interfere with her access to daily sunlight. The neighbor's plan conformed to all local building ordinances and land use regulations. The owner had been in the house for 10 years and the neighbor recently bought the adjoining lot. The owner showed that a different placement of the house would not interfere with her use and enjoyment of her residence. The trial judge ruled in favor of the defendant on the basis that the defendant had a right to build his house anywhere as long as he followed the building/zoning laws. The owner appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the trial court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\nB. Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\nC. No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.\nD. No, because a comparative evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each position favor the neighbor's position.\n"

However, the owner's claim of a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process is not a direct basis for reversal. The owner's claim is more likely to be considered under the standard of review for constitutional claims, which is a higher standard of review than the standard applied in this case.\n\nB. **Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.**\n   - This option suggests that the trial court's decision to enjoin the neighbor's construction based on the owner's claim of a private nuisance is likely to be reversed.
