HM regards capitalism as producing extreme insecurity in its disempowerment of the worker or labourer, from whom the ability to control labour or output is removed by the capitalist.\nB. HM regards the assertion by liberalists and realists that the capitalist economic sphere is non-political to be a misrepresentation, serving the interests of the unelected capitalist elite.\nC. HM regards the capitalist's accumulation of surplus value as a by-product of labour to be exploitation of those labourers by which the value was originally produced.\nD. All of these options.\n"
