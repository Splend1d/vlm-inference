This means that $x=r$ is a solution to the equation.\n\nGiven that $x=r$, we can substitute $r$ for $x$ in the original equation:\n\n\\[(r-p)(r-q) = (r-p)(r-q)\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[(r-p)(r-q) = (r-p)(r-q)\\]\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we can conclude that $x=r$ is indeed a solution to the equation. Therefore, the other solution in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$ is $x=r$. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. p-q-r"
