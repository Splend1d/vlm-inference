Taking pictures without consent is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it is done in a public or semi-public setting. In scenario 2, knocking over a standing stone at Stonehenge is a historical and cultural act that is generally considered a sacred and important event in the history of the site. It is not considered morally wrong in the context of the historical and cultural significance of the site."
