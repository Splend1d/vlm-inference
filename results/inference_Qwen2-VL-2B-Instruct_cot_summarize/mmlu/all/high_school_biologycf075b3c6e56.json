Lignin supplements the absorption of light by chlorophyll, increasing photosynthetic output.\n\nLignin is a complex polymer that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of plant cells. It provides support and helps to maintain the shape of the plant, which is essential for its survival in the environment. However, lignin also has a significant impact on plant growth and development. It is a component of the cell walls of plant cells, which are responsible for the mechanical strength and flexibility of the plant. Lignin helps to maintain the structural integrity of the cell walls, which is important for the plant's ability to grow and develop. Additionally, lignin is a precursor for the production of other plant compounds, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, which are also important for plant growth and development."
