By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the new owner.\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land. \"\n"

The tenant's covenant to pay taxes is a condition of the lease, and it is generally held that a covenant to pay taxes will \"run with the land\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant points:\n\n1. **Tenant's Covenant to Pay Taxes**: The tenant covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. This covenant is a condition of the lease.\n\n2. **Assignment of Leasehold Interest**: The tenant assigned his leasehold interest to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This assignment was silent concerning the payment of taxes.\n\n3. **Conveyance of Property Interest**: The landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner six months after the assignment. The new owner paid the taxes on the property.\n\n4. **Judgment Against the Student**: The new owner brought suit against the student for the amount paid in taxes. The judgment should be for the new owner.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. the new owner.**\n\nThe tenant's covenant to pay taxes is a condition of the lease, and it is generally held that a covenant to pay taxes will \"run with the land\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease. The assignment of the leasehold interest to the student was silent concerning the payment of taxes, and the tenant's covenant to pay taxes was not explicitly stated in the original lease. Therefore, the judgment should be for the new owner, who paid the taxes on the property."
