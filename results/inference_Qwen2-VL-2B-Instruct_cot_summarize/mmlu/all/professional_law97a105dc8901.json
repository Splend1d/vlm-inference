By limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold.\n\nAn effective way of making a full disclaimer of the implied warranty is to state in writing that the vehicle is sold \"as is\" or \"with all faults.\" This clearly communicates to the buyer that the dealer is not making any warranty about the quality or suitability of the vehicle. However, limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold is not an effective way of making a full disclaimer of the implied warranty. It does not clearly communicate that the dealer is not making any warranty about the quality or suitability of the vehicle."
