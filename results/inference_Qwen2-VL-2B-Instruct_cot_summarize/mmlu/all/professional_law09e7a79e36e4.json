Fearing that students from the school might find the gun and get into trouble using it, the man put it in the trunk of his car. The man drove off, was lawfully stopped by a police officer for speeding, and allowed the officer to search his car and the trunk. During the search, the officer discovered the gun. The man was charged under a federal statute prohibiting the knowing possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Which of the following additional facts, if established, would be most helpful to the man's defense?\n\nA. He did not intend to use the gun for an unlawful purpose.\nB. He did not know about the federal statute.\nC. He was driving to the police station to give the gun to the authorities when the officer stopped his car.\nD. His previous conviction did not involve the use of a gun or other weapon.\n"

If the gun was found in a location where it could be used for an unlawful purpose, this would be a significant defense.\n\nB. **He did not know about the federal statute.**\n   - Knowing about the statute would be irrelevant to the defense of \"innocent possession.\" The statute is about knowing possession, not ignorance of the law.\n\nC. **He was driving to the police station to give the gun to the authorities when the officer stopped his car.**\n   - This would be helpful if the gun was found in the trunk of the man's car during a routine traffic stop, and the man was driving to the police station to turn it in. This would suggest that the gun was not intended for use and was found in a location where it could be used.\n\nD. **His previous conviction did not involve the use of a gun or other weapon.**\n   - This would be helpful if the man's previous conviction involved a different crime, such as theft or assault, and not the use of a firearm. This would suggest that the man's criminal history does not relate to the possession of a firearm.\n\nGiven these options, the most helpful additional fact would be:\n\n**C. He was driving to the police station to give the gun to the authorities when the officer stopped his car.**\n\nThis would suggest that the gun was not intended for use and was found in a location where it could be used, which would be a strong defense against the federal statute."
