The tract included the family home, a decaying antebellum mansion complete with tennis courts, stables and a smaller second house that was once occupied by tenants who farmed the city. The second house, however, had long been vacant as a result of the economic decay of the surrounding area. Prosperity burst upon the city in 1999, and the landowner began selling acre lots in the tract. By 2006, the landowner had sold 25 acres, retaining five acres that included the antebellum mansion, tennis courts, stables, and the former tenants' house. On May, 19, 2007, the landowner entered into a valid written contract with a buyer. According to the terms of their agreement, the landowner agreed to sell and convey his remaining interest in the tract for a consideration of $500,000. The land sale contract provided a closing date of November 19, 2007 and stipulated that \"time was of the essence. \"On July 2, 2007, a fire destroyed the antebellum mansion. The landowner had the mansion insured for $450,000 against fire loss and collected that amount from the insurance company. At the closing on November 19, the buyer tendered a cashier's check for $50,000 and demanded a deed conveying a fee simple interest in the property. Conversely, the landowner tendered a deed of conveyance and demanded the full purchase price of $500,000. The buyer refused the landowner's demand. In an appropriate action for specific performance against the buyer, the landowner demanded $500,000. If the landowner prevails, which of the following is the best rationale for the outcome?\n\nA. The fact that the antebellum mansion was insured for $450,000 is irrelevant.\nB. The landowner and the buyer each had an insurable interest in the property.\nC. The doctrine of equitable conversion has been abolished.\nD. The doctrine of equitable conversion requires such a result.\n"

                    "text": "The best rationale for the outcome is:\n\nD. The doctrine of equitable conversion requires such a result.\n\nThe doctrine of equitable conversion is a legal principle that allows a court to order the performance of a contract even if the parties have not agreed to it. In this case, the landowner and the buyer had not agreed to the terms of the contract, but the buyer demanded the full purchase price of $500,000, which the landowner refused to accept. The court would have to determine whether the buyer had an insurable interest in the property, which would determine whether the buyer could be ordered to perform the contract. If the buyer had an insurable interest, the court would have to determine whether the buyer had a reasonable expectation of receiving the full purchase price, which would determine whether the buyer could be ordered to perform the contract. If the buyer did not have an insurable interest, the court would have to determine whether the buyer had a reasonable expectation of receiving the full purchase price, which would determine whether the buyer could be ordered to perform the contract."
