They found that patients who drank at least three cups of green tea per day had a much lower incidence of depression. In an American newspaper article about this study, which of the following statements should not be made?\n\nA. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have healthier lifestyles than those who don't.\nB. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have a more positive outlook on life than those who don't.\nC. Because this is observational data, the association between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression is not an indication of a causal relationship.\nD. People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n"

People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n\nThe study found that patients who drank at least three cups of green tea per day had a lower incidence of depression. This suggests that green tea consumption may be associated with a lower incidence of depression. However, it does not necessarily mean that drinking green tea causes the lower incidence of depression. There could be other factors contributing to both the consumption of green tea and the lower incidence of depression. Therefore, the statement that should not be made is:\n\nD. People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n\nThe other statements are reasonable inferences based on the study findings."
