If the shopper offers into evidence the fact that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid, the court should rule that the evidence is\n\nA. admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.\nB. admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.\nC. inadmissible, because it shows subsequent repair, which is against public policy.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is irrelevant to the accident.\n"

The fact that the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid two days after the accident suggests that the owner had the opportunity to address the unsafe condition before the accident occurred. This repair would not have been necessary if the owner had been aware of the unsafe condition and taken appropriate action to prevent it. Therefore, the evidence is not relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition and is therefore inadmissible."
