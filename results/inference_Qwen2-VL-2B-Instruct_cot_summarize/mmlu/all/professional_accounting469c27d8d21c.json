The unlevered value is the value of the firm without the debt. The tax shield is the difference between the unlevered value and the levered value.\n\nThe tax shield is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Shield} = \\text{Unlevered Value} - \\text{Levered Value} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Shield} = 4.78 \\text{ million} - 5 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Shield} = -0.22 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the tax shield is a loss. Therefore, the value of the tax shield is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Shield} = -0.22 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Shield} = -\\$220,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $220,000"
