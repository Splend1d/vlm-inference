In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\nC. legal title remained in Sloan.\nD. equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n"

Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\n\nThe doctrine of equitable conversion, also known as equitable conversion, is a legal principle that allows courts to redistribute the benefits or burdens of a contract between the parties. In this case, Beeson refused to honor the contract because the rezoning of the property changed its intended use from commercial to residential. As a result, the city council's decision to change the use of the property was a significant change in the contract terms, which would be considered unjust enrichment for Beeson. Therefore, the court is likely to award specific performance to Beeson, as it would be unfair for Sloan to benefit from the rezoning without compensation for the loss of the commercial use of the property."
