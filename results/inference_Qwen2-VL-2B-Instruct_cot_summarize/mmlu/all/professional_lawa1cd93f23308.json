The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives \"be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. \" As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?\n\nA. There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.\nB. The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.\nD. Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.\n"

The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that the federal courts have no jurisdiction to render advisory opinions or to decide questions of constitutionality. The case in question involves a political question, which is a question that is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. The state court's ruling that the candidate was a resident of the state was a decision on a question of state law, which is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. Therefore, the federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case."
