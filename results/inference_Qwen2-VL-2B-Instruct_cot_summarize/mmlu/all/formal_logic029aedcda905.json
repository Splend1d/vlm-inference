Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the logical structure of the given proposition, which states that there exists at least one house that is bigger than all large apartments. The proposition asserts that there are at least two types of entities (houses and large apartments) and that there is a relationship between them (being bigger than each other). The interpretation D captures this relationship and the existence of at least one house that is bigger than all large apartments."
