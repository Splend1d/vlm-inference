Public goods are goods or services that are provided by the government to benefit the entire population, such as roads, parks, and public transportation. By providing these public goods, the government can ensure that everyone benefits from the use of these resources, and there is no incentive for individuals to avoid paying for them. This can help to reduce the free rider problem, as individuals will be more likely to contribute to the public good if they know that it is being provided by the government."
