The building was called a \"twin\" home, i.e., it was divided into two separate residential units. However, the front entrance was located entirely on one of the lots; there was a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence used to access their home. Owner sold the lot on which the stairway was located to the buyer, and owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building. The deed did not contain a reservation of a right to use the doorway. The parties later disputed whether owner could continue to use the entrance that was located on the lot that he sold. What will a court most appropriately decide regarding the rights of the disputing parties?\n\nA. The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\nB. The buyer can prevent access to owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\nC. The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\nD. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.\n"

If the doorway was necessary for the owner's access to the building, the court will likely find that the owner has an implied right to use the doorway.\n\n2. **Necessity of Access**: The court will also consider whether the doorway was essential for the owner's access to the building. If the doorway was essential for the owner's access, the court will likely find that the owner has an implied right to use the doorway.\n\n3. **Necessity of Use for the Buyer**: The court will also consider whether the doorway was essential for the buyer's use of the building. If the doorway was essential for the buyer's use, the court will likely find that the buyer has an implied right to use the doorway.\n\n4. **Defective Deed**: The court will not automatically order a new deed to be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights. Instead, the court will focus on the necessity of the doorway for the owner's and buyer's use.\n\nTherefore, the court will most appropriately decide that the owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway."
