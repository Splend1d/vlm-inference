HA: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2\u2260 0.\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no difference between the \"proper behavior\" ratings for children receiving positive rewards (\u03bc1) and punishment (\u03bc2). The alternative hypothesis (HA) should state that there is a difference between the two ratings, which is not the case in this scenario. Therefore, the proper statement of HA is that there is a difference between the ratings, which is represented by the inequality \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2\u2260 0."
