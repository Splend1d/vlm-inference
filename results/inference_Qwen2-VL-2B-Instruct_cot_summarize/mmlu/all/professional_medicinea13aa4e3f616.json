The symptoms described, including fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on the hands and feet, are characteristic of immune complex deposition in tissues. This is due to the immune system's response to ATG, which can lead to the formation of immune complexes that deposit in various tissues, causing the symptoms described."
