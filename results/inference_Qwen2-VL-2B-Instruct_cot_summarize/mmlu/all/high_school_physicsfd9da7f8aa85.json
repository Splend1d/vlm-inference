Therefore, if the frequency of the sound wave is 4f, the speed of the sound wave will be:\n\nv = 4f * c = 4 * f * c\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nv = 4v\n\nTherefore, the speed of a sound wave with frequency 4f will be 4 times the speed of the original sound wave.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 4v"
