Brain patterns change from alpha waves to delta waves over the course of a night's sleep.\n\nREM sleep, also known as rapid eye movement sleep, is characterized by the brain transitioning from a state of light sleep (alpha waves) to a state of deep sleep (delta waves). This transition is known as the sleep spindle, which is a characteristic feature of REM sleep. The brain waves change from alpha to delta waves, and the body's activity also changes, with the body moving more rapidly and the muscles becoming more relaxed. This is why REM sleep is often referred to as paradoxical sleep because the brain and body are in a state of paradoxical activity."
