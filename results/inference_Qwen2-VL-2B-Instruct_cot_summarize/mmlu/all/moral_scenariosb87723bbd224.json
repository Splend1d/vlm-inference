Getting good grades is generally considered a positive outcome, and it is not inherently wrong to strive for academic success. However, the character's actions of not doing their homework are morally wrong because it is a form of dishonesty and undermines the value of their own work.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something that is not clearly morally wrong. Asking someone not to wear their jersey is a request for consideration and is generally considered a polite and respectful way to communicate. It is not inherently wrong to ask for something, and the character's actions are not morally wrong in this context."
