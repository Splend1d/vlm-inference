According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is clearly morally wrong because it involves sexual activity with a vulnerable individual who lacks the capacity to consent or provide informed consent. In scenario 2, the main character bought some beer from the liquor store when they were 14. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a legal and age-appropriate purchase for a minor."
