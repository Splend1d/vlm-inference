Therefore, for four attributes, the total number of combinations is \\(6^4\\).\n\nFor the class, since there are 3 possible values, the number of combinations for the class is \\(3!\\), which is \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\).\n\nMultiplying the number of combinations for the attributes by the number of combinations for the class gives the total number of different examples:\n\n\\[6^4 \\times 6 = 1296 \\times 6 = 7776\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of different examples is 7776, which corresponds to option D."
