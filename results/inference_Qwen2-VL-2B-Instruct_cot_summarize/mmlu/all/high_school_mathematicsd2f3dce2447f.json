Now, we need to find the equation of the tangent line in point-slope form, which is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. We can use the point (4, 4) to find the equation of the tangent line.\n\ny - 4 = 16 ln 2(x - 4)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny - 4 = 16 ln 2(x - 4)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 2)"
