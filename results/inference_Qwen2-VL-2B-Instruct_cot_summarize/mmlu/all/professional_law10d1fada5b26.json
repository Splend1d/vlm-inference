A friend of the woman had known the woman for years and knew that she was an easily excitable person. The friend also hated the woman's husband. Knowing that the woman was present, the friend drew a pistol and threatened to kill the husband. The woman suffered severe emotional distress as a result of witnessing this incident and soon afterward had a miscarriage. In an action by the woman against the friend for mental anguish resulting in her miscarriage, the woman will\n\nA. lose, because the friend did not intend for the woman to suffer a miscarriage.\nB. lose, because the friend's actions were directed against the husband, not the woman.\nC. win, because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\nD. win, because she is the husband's wife.\n"

The friend's threats and actions were directed at the husband, not the woman. The woman's emotional distress was a direct result of witnessing the friend's violent and threatening behavior towards her husband. Therefore, the woman has a strong case for mental anguish resulting from the friend's actions, which would likely result in her winning the case against the friend."
