The organization usually used leafleting and public speeches to advance this view, but it sometimes engaged in violent demonstrations against the embassies and consuls of those countries. Although the woman had never participated in a violent demonstration, she was criminally prosecuted for being a member of the organization. In her defense, the woman claimed that her association with the organization was protected by the First Amendment. Which of the following would the prosecution need to prove to overcome that defense?\n\nA. The woman joined the organization with the specific intent of furthering its illegal activities.\nB. The woman provided material aid to the organization through the payment of dues before the violent demonstrations.\nC. The woman continued to provide material aid to the organization through the payment of dues after the violent demonstrations.\nD. The woman expressed public support of the organization after the violent demonstrations.\n"

This is because the First Amendment protects speech and assembly, but it does not protect criminal activities such as violent demonstrations or the use of force to achieve political ends. Therefore, the prosecution would need to demonstrate that the woman's association with the organization was motivated by a desire to engage in illegal activities, such as violent demonstrations. \n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The woman joined the organization with the specific intent of furthering its illegal activities."
