The frequency of the sound waves will change depending on the speed and direction of the source relative to the detector. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The source travels toward the stationary detector:\n- If the source is moving towards the detector, the frequency of the sound waves will increase. This is because the source is moving faster than the speed of sound, causing the waves to be shifted to a higher frequency.\n- If the source is moving away from the detector, the frequency of the sound waves will decrease. This is because the source is moving slower than the speed of sound, causing the waves to be shifted to a lower frequency.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, there is a Doppler shift.\n\nB. The detector travels toward the stationary source:\n- If the detector is moving towards the source, the frequency of the sound waves will increase. This is because the detector is moving faster than the speed of sound, causing the waves to be shifted to a higher frequency.\n- If the detector is moving away from the source, the frequency of the sound waves will decrease. This is because the detector is moving slower than the speed of sound, causing the waves to be shifted to a lower frequency.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, there is a Doppler shift.\n\nC. Both the source and detector travel in the same direction:\n- In this scenario, the source and detector are moving in the same direction, which means there is no relative motion between them. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift.\n\nD. Both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other:\n- If the source and detector are moving in opposite directions, the frequency of the sound waves will change depending on the speed and direction of the source relative to the detector. However, since the source and detector are moving away from each other, the frequency of the sound waves will decrease. This is because the source is moving slower than the speed of sound, causing the waves to be shifted to a lower frequency.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, there is a Doppler shift.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Both the source and detector travel in the same direction."
