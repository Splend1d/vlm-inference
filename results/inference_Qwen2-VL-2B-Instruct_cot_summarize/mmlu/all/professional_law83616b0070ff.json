A pediatrician informed the infant's father that unless his daughter received immediate medical treatment, she would die. The father, who was very religious, refused to permit the pediatrician to administer the necessary treatment. He explained that his faith in his religion would restore his daughter to good health. As a consequence, the pediatrician sought an order from the state court, where the father was present, permitting the pediatrician to provide the necessary medical treatment to the infant. Which of the following is the father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order?\n\nA. The order violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The order violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The order violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe free exercise clause of the First Amendment protects individuals from being compelled to engage in religious activities that they find objectionable. In this case, the father's religious beliefs prohibit the administration of the necessary medical treatment to his daughter. The court order would require the pediatrician to administer the treatment, which would be in direct conflict with the father's religious beliefs. This directly violates the free exercise clause, as it would force the father to engage in an activity he finds objectionable."
