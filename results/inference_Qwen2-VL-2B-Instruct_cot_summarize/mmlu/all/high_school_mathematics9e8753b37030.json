Then the sequence is $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \\ldots$.\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$, where $n$ is the number of terms and $l$ is the last term.\nIn this case, the last term is $a + 4d$, so we have $240 = \\frac{10}{2}(a + (a + 4d))$.\nSimplifying the right side gives $240 = 5(a + 5d)$, or $48 = a + 5d$.\nSince $a$ and $d$ are consecutive odd integers, we can write $a = 2n + 1$ and $d = 2n + 1$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstituting these into the equation $48 = a + 5d$ gives $48 = 2n + 1 + 10n + 5$, or $48 = 12n + 6$.\nSimplifying gives $42 = 12n$, or $n = 3.5$.\nSince $n$ must be an integer, there are no solutions to this equation.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.
