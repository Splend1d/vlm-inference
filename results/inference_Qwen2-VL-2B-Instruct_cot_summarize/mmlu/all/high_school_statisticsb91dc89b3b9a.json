A matched pairs t-test\n\nThis is because the volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either the old formula or the new formula, and the response variable is the difference in the number of pimples between the two treatments. This setup is characteristic of a matched pairs design, where the same subjects are measured twice (once with each treatment). The matched pairs t-test is appropriate for comparing the effectiveness of two treatments when the subjects are matched on a relevant characteristic (such as age, gender, or skin type)."
