Using a collection agency without informing the client first and without a clear and justifiable reason for doing so could be considered unethical. It is important to communicate with the client and explain the situation in a way that is fair and transparent. If the client does not pay her fees in a timely manner, it is important to consider the ethical guidelines and the best course of action to take. Using a collection agency as a \"last resort\" is a reasonable and ethical approach to collecting the fees."
