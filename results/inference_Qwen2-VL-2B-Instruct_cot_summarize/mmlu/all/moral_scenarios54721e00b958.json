According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, littering is generally considered morally wrong. Therefore, the main character's action is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character cleared their roommate's essay without permission. This action is generally considered morally wrong as well. However, it is not explicitly stated whether this action is considered morally wrong in the context of the scenario. If the action is considered morally wrong, it would be morally wrong. If it is not considered morally wrong, it would not be morally wrong."
