The I2 molecule is much larger than Br2 (atomic radii are 114 and 133 pm, respectively). Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?\n\nA. Bromine is a liquid and boils; iodine is a solid and sublimes.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in I2 are much weaker than those in Br2.\nC. The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of iodine is much greater than the mass of bromine.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The I2 molecule is much larger than Br2 (atomic radii are 114 and 133 pm, respectively), which means that the intermolecular forces between the molecules are much weaker in I2 than in Br2. This is because the larger molecules have a lower density, which means that the intermolecular forces are weaker. As a result, the molecules are less tightly packed and can therefore boil at a lower temperature."
