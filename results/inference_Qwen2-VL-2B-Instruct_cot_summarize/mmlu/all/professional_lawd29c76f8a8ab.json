                    "text": "A man wearing a jacket and jeans walked along a city street at night in a high crime area known for drug trafficking and gun violence. He saw two police officers walking toward him. The officers were checking on a 911 call from a resident who observed a man in jeans and a jacket apparently selling drugs to people on the street. When the police first saw him, he was walking alone, in the area that the woman identified. As they approached, he suddenly crossed the street by jaywalking. They followed, and approaching from behind, asked him to stop. He started walking faster, away from them. The officers saw what appeared to be a heavy object bulging in his pocket as he moved. The officers, with over 10 years of foot patrol experience, stepped up and stopped him. They patted him down and found a concealed, unlicensed handgun in the jacket pocket. They then made a full search and found 50 packets of heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the gun and drug evidence. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?\n\nA. No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\nB. No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.\nC. Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.\nD. Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to suppress the evidence in this case. The key factors that support this conclusion are:\n\n1. **Reasonable Suspicion**: The officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the man because they observed him walking alone in a high crime area, which is a common tactic used by law enforcement to identify potential suspects. The fact that he suddenly crossed the street and walked faster away from them is a reasonable interpretation of his behavior, which could be interpreted as a reaction to the officers' presence.\n\n2. **Articulable Suspicion**: The officers had articulable suspicion to frisk the man because they observed a heavy object bulging in his pocket, which could be a weapon. This is a reasonable interpretation of the officers' actions, as they had a reasonable suspicion that the object was a weapon.\n\n3. **Arrest**: The officers had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him. This is a reasonable interpretation of the officers' actions, as they had probable cause to believe that the man was a threat to public safety.\n\n4. **Avoidance of the Officers**: The man had a right to avoid the officers under the circumstances. The officers' actions were reasonable in that they had a reasonable suspicion to stop him and then proceeded with the arrest based on their probable cause to arrest.\n\nGiven these factors, the court is likely to suppress the evidence because the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the man and then proceeded with the arrest based on probable cause. The man's behavior, including walking away from the officers, was not a reasonable interpretation of his behavior but rather a reaction to the officers' presence. Therefore, the court is likely to suppress the evidence.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.**"
