They have equal magnitude and are pointed in the same direction.\n\nWhen two non-zero vectors are added together, the resultant vector will be zero if and only if the two vectors are equal in magnitude and have the same direction. This is because the sum of two vectors is zero if and only if the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other."
