She argues that both actions can be morally equivalent, depending on the circumstances. For example, in the case of Smith, killing him would be morally worse than letting him die, but in the case of Jones, letting him die would be morally worse than killing him. Therefore, the moral distinction between killing and letting someone die is not absolute, and both actions can be morally equivalent."
