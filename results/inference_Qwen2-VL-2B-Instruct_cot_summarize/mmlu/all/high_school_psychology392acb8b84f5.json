It involves manipulating variables to see if they have the predicted effects on the dependent variable. If the results are statistically significant, it suggests that the theory is likely correct. However, it is important to note that there are many other methods and techniques that can be used to prove a theory, such as meta-analysis, qualitative research, and case studies."
