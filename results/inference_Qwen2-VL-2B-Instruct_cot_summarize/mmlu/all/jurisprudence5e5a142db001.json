They believe that law is a set of rules that are imposed by the state and is independent of moral considerations. However, non-positivist legal theorists also acknowledge that law is deeply influenced by moral values and principles. They argue that the law is inextricably bound up with morals, meaning that the two are intertwined and cannot be separated."
