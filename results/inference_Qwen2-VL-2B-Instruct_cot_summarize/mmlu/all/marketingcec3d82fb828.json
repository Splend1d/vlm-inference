In this case, the owners of independent gasoline stations agreeing to keep their prices high to protect their profitability could be found guilty under this act, which could result in prison time.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- B. found guilty under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and face large fines: This act is related to the sale of goods and services, but it does not apply to the pricing agreements of independent gasoline stations.\n\n- C. found guilty under the Adamson Act and face prison time and fines: This act is related to the sale of goods and services, but it does not apply to the pricing agreements of independent gasoline stations.\n\n- D. found not guilty because retailers are allowed to set their own price levels: This is a legal principle that does not apply to the pricing agreements of independent gasoline stations."
