                    "text": "In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the grower did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. This jurisdiction uses Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. In 2008, what is the present state of title to the orange grove if the jurisdiction's recording act provides: \"Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute\"?\n\nA. In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\nB. In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.\nC. In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\nD. In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.\n"

                    "text": "The problem involves understanding the principles of real property law, particularly in a notice jurisdiction, where conveyances of real property are invalid unless recorded. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The rancher's deed to his son was valid on its face but not recorded.\n2. The son neglected to record the deed.\n3. The fanner's deed to the fanner was valid and recorded.\n4. The retiree's deed was valid and recorded.\n5. The grower's deed was valid and recorded.\n\nThe question asks about the present state of title to the orange grove in 2008, given the jurisdiction's recording act.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nA. **In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.**\n   - This option suggests that the grower would acquire record title based on the chain of title, which is not necessarily correct. The chain of title in a notice jurisdiction is not necessarily the same as in a race jurisdiction.\n\nB. **In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.**\n   - This option suggests that the farmer would acquire equitable title based on the fence and the failure to record the rancher's deed. However, the fence was erected by the fanner, not the farmer, and the fanner did record the rancher's deed. Thus, the fanner would not acquire equitable title.\n\nC. **In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.**\n   - This option suggests that the buyer would acquire record title based on the chain of title, which is not necessarily correct. The chain of title in a notice jurisdiction is not necessarily the same as in a race jurisdiction.\n\nD. **In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.**\n   - This option suggests that the retiree would acquire record title based on the chain of title, which is not necessarily correct. The chain of title in a notice jurisdiction is not necessarily the same as in a race jurisdiction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is **C. In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.**"
