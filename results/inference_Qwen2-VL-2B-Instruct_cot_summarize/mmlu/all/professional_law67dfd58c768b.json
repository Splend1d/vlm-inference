Officers then submitted to a magistrate an affidavit setting forth circumstances showing probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. The magistrate issued a search warrant for narcotics at the man's address. Police officers went to the man's home and rang the door bell. When no one answered, the police broke in and entered the dwelling. They searched the rooms on the first floor and found no incriminating evidence, then walked outside and noticed a separate entrance leading up to the second floor of the dwelling. They ascended the stairway and entered an upstairs bedroom. Inside the room the officers found a stash of cocaine lying on a dresser. As the officers were continuing their search of the bedroom, the defendant entered the room. The police asked the defendant if he was the man. The defendant identified himself and told the police that they were in his bedroom and he occupied the second floor of the dwelling. The defendant explained that the man resided on the first floor and his living quarters were separate from the defendant's. Nonetheless, the defendant was placed under arrest and charged with possession of cocaine. The defendant has filed a motion to exclude the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The defendant's motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the warrant did not name the defendant.\nB. granted, because the warrant did not state with specificity the area to be searched.\nC. denied, because the police reasonably believed they were searching the man's residence when they entered the defendant's living quarters.\nD. denied, because the warrant was valid and issued with probable cause.\n"

This means that the officers had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant was involved in the illegal activity, and the warrant was issued based on that belief.\n\n2. **Search Warrant**: The warrant specifically authorized the officers to search the defendant's residence for narcotics. The officers had a reasonable expectation of finding the drugs in the defendant's living quarters, as they were searching for them.\n\n3. **Entry**: The officers entered the defendant's residence without a warrant, but they had a reasonable expectation of finding the drugs in the defendant's living quarters. The defendant's living quarters were separate from the defendant's residence, and the officers had a reasonable belief that they were searching the defendant's residence when they entered the defendant's living quarters.\n\n4. **Identification**: The defendant identified himself and explained that he was in his bedroom and occupied the second floor of the dwelling. This further supports the officers' belief that they were searching the defendant's residence.\n\n5. **Search of Bedroom**: The officers searched the defendant's bedroom and found the cocaine on the dresser. The officers had a reasonable expectation of finding the drugs in the defendant's living quarters, and the defendant's living quarters were separate from the defendant's residence.\n\nTherefore, the warrant was valid and issued with probable cause, and the officers had a reasonable expectation of finding the drugs in the defendant's living quarters when they entered the defendant's bedroom. The cocaine should be admitted into evidence."
