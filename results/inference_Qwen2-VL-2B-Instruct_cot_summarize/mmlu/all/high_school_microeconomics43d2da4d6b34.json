In this case, the opportunity cost is the amount of other good or service that must be given up to produce one additional unit of the good or service.\n\nSince Dorothy can pull 100 weeds per hour of cooking, and Ray can pull 50 weeds per hour of cooking, Dorothy has a comparative advantage in cooking because she can produce more weeds per hour of cooking at a lower opportunity cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking."
