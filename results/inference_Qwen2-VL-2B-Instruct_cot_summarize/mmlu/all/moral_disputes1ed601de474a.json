This means that the value of autonomy extends beyond the ability to make decisions about life or death.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions.\n- This option suggests that autonomy is limited to making big decisions, which is not necessarily the case. Autonomy can encompass many aspects of life, including making choices about life and death.\n\nB. Terminally ill patients are not capable of freely choosing to end their own lives.\n- This option is a factual statement about the capabilities of terminally ill patients but does not address the broader issue of autonomy.\n\nC. Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions.\n- This option suggests that killing a person is a form of destruction, which is a strong argument against autonomy-based justifications. However, it does not directly address the contradiction between autonomy and the ability to make choices about life and death.\n\nD. Above of the above.\n- This option encompasses both A and B, suggesting that the value of autonomy is limited to making big decisions and that terminally ill patients are not capable of freely choosing to end their own lives.\n\nGiven the context, the most comprehensive answer that encompasses both the limitations of autonomy and the inability of terminally ill patients to make choices about life and death is:\n\nD. Above of the above"
