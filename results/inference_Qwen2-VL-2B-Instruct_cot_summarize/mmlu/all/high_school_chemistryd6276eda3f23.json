A greater distribution of reactant molecules will have high velocities.\n\nIncreasing the temperature of the reaction will not necessarily increase the rate of reaction if the reactants are already at high velocities. The activation energy is the minimum energy required for a reactant to overcome the activation barrier and become a reactant. If the reactants are already at high velocities, increasing the temperature will not change the activation energy barrier, and therefore, the rate of reaction will not increase."
