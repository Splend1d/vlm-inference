Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following factors did Alexander Hamilton believe was a source for the problems in the excerpt from Federalist #15?\n\nA. economic class divisions among the American people that prevented them from forging a unified vision.\nB. a failure of American policy-makers to abandon mercantilist principles and to embrace a laissez-faire approach to trade.\nC. a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\nD. an unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which factor Alexander Hamilton believed was a source for the problems in the excerpt from Federalist #15, we need to analyze the context and the core of the quote.\n\nThe quote discusses the attitudes and behaviors of whites towards freedmen, particularly regarding their rights and treatment. It highlights how whites view freedmen as property and how they treat them in a way that suggests they are not considered as individuals with rights.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Economic class divisions among the American people that prevented them from forging a unified vision.\n- This option suggests that economic class divisions could hinder unity and cooperation among Americans. However, the quote does not discuss economic class divisions or their impact on unity.\n\nB. A failure of American policy-makers to abandon mercantilist principles and to embrace a laissez-faire approach to trade.\n- This option suggests a lack of economic principles, which is not directly addressed in the quote. The quote focuses on attitudes and behaviors rather than economic principles.\n\nC. A weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n- This option implies a lack of centralized authority to address pressing issues. However, the quote does not discuss the central government's powers or its ability to address pressing issues.\n\nD. An unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n- This option suggests a lack of practical interest in addressing pressing national problems due to religious and individual salvation obsessions. This directly aligns with the quote's discussion of whites' attitudes towards freedmen and their treatment as property.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the quote, the factor that Alexander Hamilton believed was a source for the problems is:\n\nD. An unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n\nFinal answer: D."
