This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves offering the babysitter a financial incentive to stay late, which is considered a form of exploitation and abuse of the babysitter's time and labor. In scenario 2, the main character went skinny-dipping in the ocean, while no one was at the beach. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a private and personal activity that does not involve any harm or exploitation of others."
