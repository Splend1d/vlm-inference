The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?\n\nA. Call her previous physician to obtain more history\nB. Order a chest x-ray\nC. Order a test for HIV antibody\nD. Repeat the PPD skin test\n"

Repeat the PPD skin test\n\nGiven the history of the girl being born in the United States and her healthy physical examination, the most appropriate next step would be to repeat the PPD skin test. This is because the initial test result of 10 mm of induration is concerning and could indicate a potential reaction to the PPD, which is a common practice in such cases to confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, the parents' concern about the girl's health and the history of being in homeless shelters suggest that further investigation is warranted to ensure her safety and well-being."
