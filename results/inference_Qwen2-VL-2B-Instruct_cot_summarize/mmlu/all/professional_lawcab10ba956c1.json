His appearance and actions led the police to believe that he fit the description of a predetermined profile of a drug courier. The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.\nB. granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.\nC. denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.\nD. denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.\n"

The defendant's refusal to hand over his overnight bag and his subsequent arrest for unlawful possession of narcotics were legal actions taken by the police in response to their suspicion of the defendant's involvement in drug trafficking. The search of the defendant's bag was conducted in a lawful manner, and the heroin was discovered as a result of that search, not as a result of an unlawful airport detention."
