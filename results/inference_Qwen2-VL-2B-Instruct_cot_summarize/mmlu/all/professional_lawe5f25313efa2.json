He saved up some money to buy a bow and other archery equipment. He set up a target in his backyard in order to practice. He surrounded the target with stacks of hay bales to stop any arrows that missed the target. After practicing for a few weeks, the boy made great improvements in his technique and accuracy. While practicing one afternoon, however, the boy lost his balance just as he released an arrow. As a result, the arrow flew way off course, going over the target and all the hay bales and flying into a wooded area behind the boy's house. The boy assumed no one was in the woods, so he was relieved that the errant arrow would not hurt anyone. However, a hiker happened to be in the woods near the boy's house. As he paused for a moment to take a drink of water, the hiker suddenly saw something out of the corner of his eye. It was the stray arrow shot by the boy. Without even thinking about it, the hiker reflexively ducked out of the way. The arrow narrowly missed the hiker's head; but as the hiker ducked out of the way, his head struck the limb of a tree, causing a stick to stab painfully into his eye. Which of the following causes of action could the hiker successfully assert against the boy?\n\nA. Assault, but not battery.\nB. Battery, but not assault.\nC. Assault and battery.\nD. Neither assault nor battery.\n"

The hiker's reaction to the arrow was not intended to harm the boy but rather to avoid injury to himself. This is a form of negligence, which is a legal defense that can be used to absolve someone from liability if they were not aware of the risk and did not take reasonable precautions to avoid it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Battery, but not assault."
