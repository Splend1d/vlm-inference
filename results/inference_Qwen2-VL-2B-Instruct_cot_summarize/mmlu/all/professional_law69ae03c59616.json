During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?\n\nA. The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.\nB. The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.\nD. The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of thepremises during the period of her alleged exposure.\n"

The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of the premises during the period of her alleged exposure.\n\nThis argument is based on the doctrine of respondeat superior, which holds that an employer is liable for the actions of its employees within the scope of their employment. In this case, the repair shop is the employer of the employee who claims emotional distress due to exposure to the toxic substance. Therefore, the manufacturer is not liable for the employee's emotional distress unless the employee can prove that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous or that she suffered any physical consequences.\n\nThe other options are not relevant to the manufacturer's argument:\n\nA. The employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.\nB. The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.\n\nThese options are not directly related to the manufacturer's defense that the employee's emotional distress is not severe or that the manufacturer's conduct was not extreme and outrageous."
