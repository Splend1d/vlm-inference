Here's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. **No, because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in failing to furnish the snowblower's manual to the mechanic.**\n   - This option suggests that the homeowner's negligence contributed to the accident. If the homeowner did not provide the necessary manual, it could be argued that they were not fully informed about the proper use of the snowblower, which could have contributed to the malfunction. However, this is a strong possibility and would depend on the specific circumstances of the repair and the homeowner's actions.\n\nB. **No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party.**\n   - This option suggests that the alteration made by the mechanic was the cause of the injury. If the alteration was substantial and not intended to be repaired, it could be argued that the manufacturer is not liable for the injury. However, this is also a strong possibility and would depend on the specific circumstances of the repair and the manufacturer's responsibility.\n\nC. **Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.**\n   - This option suggests that the manufacturer is liable for the injury because the snowblower had a defect that caused the homeowner's injury. This would depend on whether the manufacturer had a duty to ensure the snowblower was safe and whether they had a reasonable opportunity to do so. If the manufacturer had a duty to ensure the snowblower was safe and had a reasonable opportunity to do so, they could be held liable.\n\nD. **Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel.**\n   - This option suggests that the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel. If the manufacturer had a duty to provide the manual to repair personnel, they could be held liable for any defects in the snowblower that caused the homeowner's injury. However, this is a strong possibility and would depend on the specific circumstances of the repair and the manufacturer's responsibility.\n\nGiven the options, the most definitive answer would be:\n\n**C. Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.**\n\nThis option is the most comprehensive and directly addresses the issue of whether the manufacturer is liable for the homeowner's injury based on the specific circumstances of the repair and the manufacturer's responsibility."
