The plaintiff claimed that the defendant drove through a red light and hit her as she was crossing the street. The posted speed limit at the scene of the accident was 25 m. p. h. In his case-in-chief, the defendant testified that the traffic light was green and he was driving carefully at 20 m. p. h. The plaintiff's attorney did not cross-examine the defendant. Rather, she called a police officer who testified that the defendant told him immediately after the accident that he was going 30 m. p. h. The police officer's testimony is\n\nA. a prior inconsistent statement and, therefore, admissible to impeach.\nB. hearsay, but admissible as a prior inconsistent statement for any purpose.\nC. admissible, as offered against the defendant.\nD. inadmissible, because the accident report is the best evidence of what the defendant told the police officer.\n"

This means it is not a direct statement made during the trial, but rather a statement made after the trial.\n\n2. **Hearsay**: The hearsay rule allows for the admission of statements made by a witness who is not present at the time of the trial. In this case, the police officer's testimony is hearsay because he was not present at the trial.\n\n3. **Purpose of Admissibility**: The hearsay testimony is admissible for any purpose, including impeachment. The plaintiff's attorney did not cross-examine the defendant, so the hearsay testimony is not being used to impeach the defendant's testimony.\n\nTherefore, the hearsay testimony is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement for any purpose."
