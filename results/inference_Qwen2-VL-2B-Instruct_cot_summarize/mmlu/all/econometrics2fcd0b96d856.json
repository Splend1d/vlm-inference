It is a test for the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression model. The test statistic is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression model. The test statistic is then compared to a critical value from the chi-squared distribution to determine whether there is evidence of autocorrelation. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
