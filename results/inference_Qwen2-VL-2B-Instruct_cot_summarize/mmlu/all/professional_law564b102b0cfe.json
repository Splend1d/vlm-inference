The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably\n\nA. succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.\nB. succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.\nC. not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\nD. not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n"

The mortgagee (the lender) has a lien on the property, which means they have the right to take possession of the property if the borrower (the farmer in this case) defaults on the mortgage. The farmer cannot simply claim that they did not promise to pay the mortgage debt because the mortgage was recorded immediately. The farmer must prove that they had a promise to pay the mortgage debt before the mortgage was recorded."
