Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n- This option suggests that empires used military force to weaken rival tribes, which aligns with the passage's description of exterminating rival tribes and the desire for rivalry among them.\n\nB. Empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\n- The passage does not explicitly mention the benefits of welcoming barbarian migrations, so this option is not directly supported.\n\nC. Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\n- The passage does not mention the expansion of influence through military force, so this option is not directly supported.\n\nD. Empires used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state.\n- The passage does not mention any religious conversion efforts, so this option is not directly supported.\n\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion that is most directly supported by the passage is:\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n\nFinal answer: A. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state."
