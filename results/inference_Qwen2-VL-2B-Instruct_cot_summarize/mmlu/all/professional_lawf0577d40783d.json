Although the owner used due care in keeping the animal in a securely fenced area, he knew of one prior incident where the animal got loose and bit someone. Is the dog's owner liable for the injuries to the mailman?\n\nA. No, he is not liable because he used due care and was not negligent under the circumstances.\nB. No, he is not liable because the man was on someone else's property at the time of the incident.\nC. Yes, he is liable because a dog owner is always liable for any injuries caused to a third person.\nD. Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n"

Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n\nThe mail carrier was on someone else's property when he was bitten by the dog. The owner of the dog, who knew of the dog's dangerous propensities, is strictly liable for any injuries caused to the mailman. This is because the owner had knowledge of the dog's dangerous nature and was aware of the risk it posed to the mailman. The mail carrier's injury was a foreseeable consequence of the owner's knowledge of the dog's dangerous nature, and the owner is therefore strictly liable for any damages caused by the dog."
