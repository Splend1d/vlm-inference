There are 16 ounces in a pound, so a 28-pound bag of dog food is equal to $28 \\times 16 = 448$ ounces.\n\nFei Yen's dog eats 8 ounces of dog food each day. To find out how many days the bag of dog food will last, we divide the total number of ounces in the bag by the amount of dog food eaten each day. So, $448 \\div 8 = 56$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{56}$."
