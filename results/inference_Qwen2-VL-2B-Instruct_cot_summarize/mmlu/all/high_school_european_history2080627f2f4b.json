And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living.\nWe remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.\nElie Wiesel, \"Reflections of a Survivor,\" 1987\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Wiesel believed that the current generation of Germans\n\nA. shared their ancestors' guilt for the Holocaust\nB. had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust\nC. shared in the responsibility for the Holocaust\nD. had no responsibility where the Holocaust was concerned\n"
