Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. This would allow you to gather more information and potentially provide support or guidance to the colleague as he navigates this difficult situation. It is important to remember that the colleague's decision to end the relationship with a client is his own, and it is not within your role as a psychologist to make judgments or intervene in his personal life."
