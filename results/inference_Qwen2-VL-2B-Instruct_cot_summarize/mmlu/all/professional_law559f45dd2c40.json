The defendant was provoked by accidentally seeing his wife having sexual relations with his best friend.\nD. The defendant acted without deliberation and premeditation.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. The defendant was provoked by accidentally seeing his wife having sexual relations with his best friend.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter is a charge that requires the defendant to have acted with a specific intent to cause death, even if the death was accidental. In this case, the defendant's actions were accidental, and the provocation was accidental as well. Therefore, the defendant did not have the specific intent required for voluntary manslaughter."
