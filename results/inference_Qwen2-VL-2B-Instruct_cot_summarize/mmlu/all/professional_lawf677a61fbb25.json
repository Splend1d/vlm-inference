No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\nC.

This testimony is admissible because it is relevant to the present charge, which is theft. The defendant's good character is not relevant to the present charge, and the prosecution has not put the defendant's character in issue by accusing him of being a thief. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct."
