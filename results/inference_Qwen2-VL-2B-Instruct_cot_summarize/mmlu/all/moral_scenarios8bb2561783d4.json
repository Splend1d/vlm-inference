This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves giving something that is not intended for consumption, which can be seen as a form of exploitation or abuse of trust. In Scenario 2, the main character prayed to God that their father be diagnosed with cancer. This action is not considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020, as it is seen as a form of prayer and is generally considered a private and personal matter."
