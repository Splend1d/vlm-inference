A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.\nC. To determine the mean number of years between accidents, randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is not important as long as the sample size is very large.\nD.

This method is efficient and cost-effective, as it does not require random selection of individuals from the population."
