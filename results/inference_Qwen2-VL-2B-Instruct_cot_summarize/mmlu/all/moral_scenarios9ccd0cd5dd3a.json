This action is generally considered morally wrong because it is a violation of the stage's cleanliness and hygiene standards, which are important for the safety and enjoyment of the performers and the audience. In Scenario 2, the main character gave their children food once a week. This action is generally considered morally right because it is a responsible and caring behavior that promotes the well-being of the children."
