Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.\nGhana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963\nWhich of the following factors was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage?\n\nA.

It highlights the need for a common purpose, planning, and endeavor among African states to overcome the consequences of colonial rule.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion: This option suggests that the lack of shared cultural or linguistic ties among African states could hinder unity and progress. However, the passage does not explicitly mention the lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion as a significant factor preventing the fulfillment of political dreams.\n\nB. The spread of communism throughout the continent: This option suggests that the spread of communism could have been a significant barrier to unity and progress in Africa. However, the passage does not mention communism as a factor preventing the fulfillment of political dreams.\n\nC. Armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers: This option implies that external military intervention could have been a significant barrier to unity and progress in Africa. The passage does not mention external military intervention as a factor preventing the fulfillment of political dreams.\n\nD. Africa's shortage of natural resources: This option suggests that a lack of natural resources could have been a significant barrier to unity and progress in Africa. The passage does not mention natural resources as a factor preventing the fulfillment of political dreams.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that none of them directly addresses the lack of political unity and progress in Africa. Therefore, the most important factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage is:\n\n**A. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion**\n\nFinal answer: A. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion"
