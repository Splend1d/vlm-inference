The problem states that 7% of the graduates search for a job, which means 93% of the graduates do not go to a 2-year college or a 4-year college.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student is not going to a 2-year college or a 4-year college is:\n\\[ 1 - P(2\\text{-}year) - P(4\\text{-}year) = 1 - 0.20 - 0.54 = 0.26 \\]\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected student is going to a 4-year college is the complement of this probability:\n\\[ P(4\\text{-}year) = 1 - P(2\\text{-}year) - P(4\\text{-}year) = 1 - 0.20 - 0.54 = 0.26 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student is going to a 4-year college is \\( 0.26 \\), which corresponds to option D."
