The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism.\n- Pence might argue that SCNT is not best because it involves genetic manipulation, which could be seen as a form of genetic reductionism or genetic determinism. This objection aligns with Pence's stance on genetic determinism.\n\nB. The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually.\n- Pence might argue that SCNT individuals will be expected to have the same rights and opportunities as children born through sexual means. This objection aligns with Pence's stance on the rights and opportunities of children.\n\nC. People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change.\n- Pence might argue that SCNT individuals will not be subject to the same prejudicial attitudes as children born through sexual means. This objection aligns with Pence's stance on the potential impact of prejudicial attitudes.\n\nD. If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n- Pence might argue that SCNT is not best because it could lead to a change in people's prejudicial attitudes. This objection aligns with Pence's stance on the potential impact of prejudicial attitudes.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that Pence does not specifically address the argument that SCNT is not best for the child by assuming genetic determinism or genetic reductionism. Pence's objection is more about the potential impact of prejudicial attitudes and the potential change in these attitudes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism."
