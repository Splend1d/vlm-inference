                    "text": "A major bank foreclosed on a consumer mortgage. After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because the limitation in the original note is voidable, due to the mortgagors' breach of the mortgage terms.\nB. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because advance notice to the mortgagors is all that is required to disregard a limitation in an original note.\nC. No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\nD. No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n"

No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\n\nThe court will likely rule that the deficiency judgment for $10,000 is void and unenforceable due to the limitations clause in the original note. This is because the limitations clause is a valid contractual term that restricts the bank's ability to collect beyond the $50,000 limit. The court will likely find that the limitation clause is enforceable and that the bank's actions in enforcing the judgment were not within the bounds of legal procedure."
