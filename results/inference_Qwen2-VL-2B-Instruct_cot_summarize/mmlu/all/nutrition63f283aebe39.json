Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work\nB. Pancreatic \u00e1-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose\nC. Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.\nD.

Pancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is required to provide the correct pH for maximal pancreatic enzyme in the duodenum.\n\nThis statement is correct because hydrochloric acid (HCl) is produced in the stomach and is essential for the activation of digestive enzymes in the duodenum. The pH of the duodenum is typically around 2.0, which is too acidic for most digestive enzymes to function effectively. Hydrochloric acid neutralizes the acidity of the duodenum, allowing the digestive enzymes to function properly."
