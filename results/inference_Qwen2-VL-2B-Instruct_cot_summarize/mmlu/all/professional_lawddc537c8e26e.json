His neighbor wants to buy it so he can make his yard bigger and use the structure as a storage space, so he agrees to buy the bungalow in a written agreement. The sale is to be complete on October 14. On October 10, the neighbor realizes he cannot pay $10,000, and offers to pay $8,000 instead. The man agrees, and the exchange takes place on October 14. The man then sues for the remaining $2000. Would he likely prevail in getting the additional $2,000 that is part of the signed contract?\n\nA. No, the modification of the sales price was accepted and therefore both parties are bound to the $8000 price.\nB. Yes, there was a lack of additional consideration under the pre-existing duty rule so that the modification was invalid and the original price was still valid.\nC. No the original contract was a unilateral contract that could not be modified and had to be performed at the original price.\nD. No, there was full performance of the contract.\n"

The neighbor offered to pay $8,000, which the man accepted. This means the contract was modified to reflect the new price.\n\n2. **Consideration**: The modification of the price was accepted by both parties. The man agreed to the new price, and the neighbor accepted it. This is a clear case of mutual consent, which is a requirement for consideration.\n\n3. **Lack of Additional Consideration**: The neighbor offered to pay $8,000 instead of the original $10,000, which was not an additional consideration. The neighbor's offer was made after the contract was already signed and performed, and it was not an additional consideration that would make the contract void.\n\n4. **Pre-existing Duty Rule**: The man's original agreement was a unilateral contract, meaning he was the one who agreed to the price. The neighbor's offer to pay $8,000 was not an additional consideration that would make the contract void.\n\n5. **Performance**: The contract was performed as agreed, with the man paying the original price and the neighbor paying the modified price.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No the original contract was a unilateral contract that could not be modified and had to be performed at the original price.**\n\nThis is because the modification of the price was not an additional consideration that would make the contract void, and the contract was performed as agreed."
