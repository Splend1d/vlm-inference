Treaties do not have to assume a particular form or designated as such\n\nTreaties are legally binding agreements between two or more states, and they are typically designed to be formal and structured. However, treaties can be designed in various forms, and they do not have to assume a particular form or designated as such. The form of a treaty can be determined by the parties involved, and it can be designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of the parties."
