The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.\nB. Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.\nC. No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.\nD. No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.\n"

In this case, the man and the woman conspired to rob a bank, and they were involved in the robbery. The man raised his gun at the police officers, and a flurry of shots followed, resulting in the death of the woman. \n\nThe prevailing modern view of felony murder is that it does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime. This view is based on the principle that the co-conspirator's death is not an inherent part of the crime but rather a result of the co-conspirator's own actions.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the appellate court is likely to reverse the first-degree murder conviction. The man's actions were not part of the conspiracy to commit the robbery, and the woman's death was not a result of the man's actions. Therefore, the felony murder rule does not apply in this case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime."
