One year later, the buyer sold the house to a woman for $50,000 more than the buyer had paid, conveying it to the woman by a quitclaim deed. Four months after moving in, the woman discovered a number of latent defects in the foundation that caused the house's basement to take on water during heavy rains. The woman contacted the builder about the problem. Toward the end of their heated conversation, the builder yelled at her, \"So get it fixed!\" After the woman had the foundation repaired by a cement contractor at a cost of $25,000, she successfully sued the builder to recover that amount from him. What is the most likely reason that the woman was successful?\n\nA. The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer.\nB. The court found that by paying the buyer $50,000 more for the house than the buyer had paid the builder, the woman did not get the benefit of her bargain.\nC. The court found that by yelling at the woman to \"get it fixed,\" the builder had committed himself to paying for the repair.\nD. The court found that the defects in the foundation were a breach of the covenant of further assurances in the warranty deed from the builder to the buyer.\n"

The court found that the defects in the foundation were a breach of the covenant of further assurances in the warranty deed from the builder to the buyer.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Warranty Deed:** The builder conveyed the house to the buyer with a warranty deed, which is a legal document that guarantees certain conditions will be met by the builder. In this case, the warranty deed states that the house will be habitable.\n\n2. **Quitclaim Deed:** The buyer then sold the house to the woman, who conveyed it to her by a quitclaim deed. This deed does not mention any warranty or condition from the builder.\n\n3. **Defects in Foundation:** The woman discovered that the house had latent defects in the foundation that caused it to take on water during heavy rains. This is a breach of the warranty deed.\n\n4. **Builder's Yelling:** The builder yelled at the woman to \"get it fixed,\" implying that the builder had a duty to fix the defects. This statement is a breach of the warranty deed.\n\n5. **Covenant of Further Assurances:** The warranty deed also includes a covenant of further assurances, which states that the builder will fulfill certain conditions. If the builder breached this covenant, the buyer (the woman) can sue for damages.\n\n6. **Legal Conclusion:** The court likely found that the builder's breach of the warranty deed was sufficient to hold the builder liable for the woman's damages. The court would have found that the builder's breach of the warranty deed was a breach of the covenant of further assurances, which is enforceable by the subsequent buyer.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason the woman was successful is that the court found that the builder's breach of the warranty deed was a breach of the covenant of further assurances, making the builder liable for the woman's damages.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. The court found that the defects in the foundation were a breach of the covenant of further assurances in the warranty deed from the builder to the buyer."
