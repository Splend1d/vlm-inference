The size of the agency.\n\nMarketing research studies are typically conducted internally by the company itself, as it allows for better control and customization of the research process. External agencies may offer more specialized services or have a different approach, but the primary criterion for choosing between internal and external research is often the value for money and the likelihood of providing insights into the management problem. The size of the agency is not a significant factor in this decision."
