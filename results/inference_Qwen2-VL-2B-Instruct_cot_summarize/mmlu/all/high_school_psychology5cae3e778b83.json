Chunking** to remember the phone number.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nElise was repeating the phone number to herself, which is a common technique for chunking information. Chunking involves breaking down a complex task or task into smaller, more manageable parts. In this case, Elise was breaking down the phone number into smaller chunks, which helped her remember it more easily.\n\n- **Iconic memory:** This involves using a specific image or memory to remember something.\n- **Elaborative rehearsal:** This involves repeating the information to oneself in a more detailed or elaborate manner.\n- **Maintenance rehearsal:** This involves repeating the information to oneself to ensure it is still fresh in memory.\n- **Chunking:** This involves breaking down information into smaller, more manageable parts to make it easier to remember.\n\nGiven the context of Elise repeating the phone number to herself, the most appropriate technique for her was **chunking**."
