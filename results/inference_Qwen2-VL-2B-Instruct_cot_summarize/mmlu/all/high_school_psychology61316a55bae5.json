In this case, Scott had been trying to unscramble the letters for 20 minutes and was unsuccessful, but after walking to class, he suddenly realized the word was BAYONET. This suggests that he had been exposed to the word for a long time and had the insight to recognize it. Therefore, the correct answer is D. insight."
