The little cart gains half of the kinetic energy of the large cart, so its initial kinetic energy is 2mv. After the collision, the little cart has a velocity of v, and the large cart has a velocity of 2v. The total kinetic energy of the system is conserved, so the kinetic energy of the little cart is equal to the kinetic energy of the large cart plus half the kinetic energy of the little cart. This gives us the equation:\n\n2mv = mv + 0.5mv\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = 0.5v\n\nThis means that the little cart has a velocity of 0.5v, or 2v/2 = 1.41v. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
