This behavior is often observed in situations where individuals feel pressure to conform to the group's behavior or when the group's performance is not directly visible to them. In the context of a team tug of war, Ty's behavior of not pulling as hard as he would if he were pulling alone against one competitor exemplifies social loafing."
