Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector.\n\nSince Hector is 2 seats to the right of Kim, and Tonya is 3 seats to the right of Hector, we can determine the number of seats Kim sits to the left of Tonya by subtracting the number of seats Tonya sits to the right of Hector from the number of seats Hector sits to the right of Kim.\n\nHector sits to the right of Kim: 2 seats\nTonya sits to the right of Hector: 3 seats\n\nSo, the number of seats Kim sits to the left of Tonya is: 2 seats (Hector) - 3 seats (Tonya) = -1 seat.\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative number of seats, we must have made a mistake in our interpretation. Let's correct this:\n\n- Hector sits to the right of Kim: 2 seats\n- Tonya sits to the right of Hector: 3 seats\n\nSo, the number of seats Kim sits to the left of Tonya is: 2 seats (Hector) - 3 seats (Tonya) = -1 seat.\n\nBut we know that Kim cannot sit to the left of Tonya, so we must have made a mistake in our subtraction.
