Mechanical solidarity is characterized by a lack of social cohesion and a lack of mutual trust, which leads to conflict and instability. Organic solidarity, on the other hand, is characterized by a strong sense of community and mutual trust, which leads to greater social harmony and stability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Mechanical solidarity produces conflict in society. Organic solidarity leads to greater social harmony."
