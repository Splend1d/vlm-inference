                    "text": "The candle power of a lamp is the amount of light it produces per unit area. It is typically measured in lux (lumen per square meter). The illumination at a point 5 meters below a lamp is 6 lux. This means that the lamp is producing 6 lux of light at that point.\n\nTo find the candle power of the lamp, we can use the formula:\n\nCandle power = Illumination / Area\n\nIn this case, the illumination is 6 lux and the area is 5 meters x 5 meters = 25 square meters.\n\nSo, the candle power of the lamp is:\n\nCandle power = 6 lux / 25 square meters = 0.24 lux per square meter\n\nTo convert this to candle power, we can use the conversion factor that 1 lux is equal to 1 candle per square meter:\n\nCandle power = 0.24 lux / 1 square meter = 0.24 candle per square meter\n\nTo convert this to candle power, we can multiply by 10000 (since 1 candle is equal to 10000 lux):\n\nCandle power = 0.24 candle per square meter x 10000 = 2400 candle per square meter\n\nTherefore, the candle power of the lamp is 2400 candle per square meter.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 200."
