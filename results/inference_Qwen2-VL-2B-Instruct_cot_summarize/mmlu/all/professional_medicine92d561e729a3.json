Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?\n\nA. Adenovirus\nB. BK virus\nC. Epstein-Barr virus\nD. Herpes simplex virus\n"

This is because the patient has a history of allograft rejection, which is a common complication after kidney transplantation. EBV is a common cause of allograft rejection and can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and a sore throat. The patient's temperature of 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F) is consistent with the symptoms of EBV infection."
