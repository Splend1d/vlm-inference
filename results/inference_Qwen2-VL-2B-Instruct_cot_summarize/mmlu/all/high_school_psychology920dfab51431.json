The uncontrollable blinking of a contact lens wearer who has just gotten something in his eye\n\nThis is because the blink reflex is a learned response that occurs when a stimulus (such as a foreign object in the eye) is perceived by the brain. This reflex is a classic example of classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus (the contact lens) becomes associated with a specific response (blinking) due to repeated exposure."
