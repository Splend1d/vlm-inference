Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nIn genetics, when two individuals with a particular trait (in this case, black hair) are crossed, the offspring will have a 50% chance of inheriting the trait from each parent. This is because the trait is dominant, so the offspring will have two copies of the dominant allele (in this case, BB or Bb) and one copy of the recessive allele (bb).\n\nGiven that three quarters of the offspring have black coats, it means that the dominant allele (BB or Bb) is present in the offspring. Therefore, the genotype of the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb, as this will result in a 50% chance of having black coats in the offspring."
