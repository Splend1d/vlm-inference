                    "text": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over [a, b].\n\nIn the case of f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x, we can see that f(x) is not continuous at x = 0 because sin 0 = 0, but it is continuous everywhere else. Therefore, we cannot apply the Mean Value Theorem to this function on the interval [0, \u03c0].\n\nHowever, we can still check if the function satisfies the Mean Value Theorem on the interval [0, \u03c0] by evaluating the function at the endpoints of the interval and checking if the derivative at any point in the interval is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval.\n\nAt x = 0, f(x) = 2 sin 0 + sin 4*0 = 0 + 0 = 0. The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 sin 4x. At x = 0, f'(0) = 2 cos 0 + 4 sin 4*0 = 2(1) + 4(0) = 2. Therefore, the derivative of f(x) at x = 0 is not equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [0, \u03c0].\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1."
