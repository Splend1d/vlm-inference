We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich one of the following political movements most closely shared many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party?\n\nA. Progressivism of the early 1900s\nB. Neoconservatism of the 1980s\nC. Federalism of the late 1700s\nD. Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s\n"

It did not focus on the struggle for power and plunder, nor did it emphasize the destruction of the multitude.\n   - **Neoconservatism of the 1980s:** This movement was more focused on foreign policy and national security, and did not share the same goals as the Populist Party.\n   - **Federalism of the late 1700s:** This movement was concerned with the division of power between the federal and state governments, and did not focus on the struggle for power and plunder.\n   - **Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s:** This movement was concerned with the power of the federal government and the need for a strong central authority, but did not focus on the struggle for power and plunder.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Populist Party Platform most closely shared the goals of **Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s**.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s**"
