In the context of the study, the law raising the minimum age for purchasing alcohol from 18 to 21 might have led college students to feel threatened or threatened by the change, potentially leading to increased resistance to the law and higher rates of underage drinking. This is consistent with the predictions of psychological reactance theory."
