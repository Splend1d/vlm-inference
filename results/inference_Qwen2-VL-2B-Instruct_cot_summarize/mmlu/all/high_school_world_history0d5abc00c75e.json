By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?\n\nA. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\nB. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\nD. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this logic reasoning problem, we need to analyze the passage and identify the reason why the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, failed to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry. Let's break down the passage and analyze each option:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage discusses the development of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s. It highlights the differences in how these technologies were applied and the reasons behind the failure of the Chinese to innovate.\n\n2. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **A. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.**\n     - The passage does not mention any mention of Confucian traditionalism or its influence on the Chinese. Therefore, this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\n   - **B. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.**\n     - The passage states that China was threatened mainly by steppe nomads, which were highly mobile and could move quickly. This implies that the Chinese were focused on defending against these threats rather than developing new weaponry. Therefore, this option is supported by the passage.\n\n   - **C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.**\n     - The passage mentions that China was threatened by steppe nomads, which were highly mobile and could move quickly. This implies that the Chinese were focused on defending against these threats rather than developing new weaponry. Therefore, this option is supported by the passage.\n\n   - **D. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.**\n     - The passage does not provide any information about the cost of converting to a new military technology. Therefore, this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The passage does not mention any reason why the Chinese failed to innovate in gunpowder weaponry, but it does indicate that they were focused on defending against threats rather than developing new weaponry. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that they logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\n**Final Answer: C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.**"
