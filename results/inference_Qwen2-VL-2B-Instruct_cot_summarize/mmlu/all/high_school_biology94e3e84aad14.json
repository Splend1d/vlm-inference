It occurs when the frequency of a particular allele in a population changes due to chance events, such as the random mating of individuals. This can lead to a decrease in the frequency of the allele over time, even if the allele is beneficial. Genetic drift is a common cause of genetic variation in small populations, and it can lead to the emergence of new alleles or the loss of alleles that are no longer beneficial."
