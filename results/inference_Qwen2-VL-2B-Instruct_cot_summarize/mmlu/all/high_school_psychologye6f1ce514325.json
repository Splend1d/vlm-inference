Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\n\nExperiments are designed to isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables, allowing researchers to determine whether changes in the independent variable cause changes in the dependent variable. This is why experiments are considered the most precise method for determining causal relationships. Other research methods, such as surveys, interviews, and observational studies, may not be able to isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables and may be subject to confounding variables."
