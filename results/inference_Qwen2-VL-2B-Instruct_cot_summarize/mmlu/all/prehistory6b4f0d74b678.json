The fact that early excavators of Teotihuac\u00e1n mistook ordinary housing compounds for palaces suggests that the general standard of living was high.\n\nThis is because the early excavators were likely to have been more focused on the visible structures and artifacts rather than the living conditions of the people who lived there. If the excavators had been aware of the living conditions, they would have likely recognized the differences between the housing compounds and the palaces."
