This means that it is about 10^-24 light-years across. \n\nThe speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. Therefore, it takes about 10^-24 seconds for a signal to travel from Earth to the observable universe. \n\nSo, the percent of the observable universe that has received radio transmissions from Earth is about 10^-24 / 10^-24 = 100%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 10^-24 %."
