Highlight the extent of the author's property losses\n\nThe letter mentions that the author's homestead in the city was insured for 2,000 pounds, but it was destroyed by the Queen's enemies. The author is now suing the British government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many yards from the place, causing much damage. This suggests that the author is highlighting the extent of the property losses caused by the war and the damage done by the enemy forces."
