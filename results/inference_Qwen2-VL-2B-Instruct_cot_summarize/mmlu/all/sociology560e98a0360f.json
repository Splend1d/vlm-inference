Errors in the measurement of birth rates and production of statistics.\n\nThe general fertility rate is the average number of children a woman will bear during her reproductive years. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins. However, the primary reason for the decline in the general fertility rate between 1964 and 2000 is due to errors in the measurement of birth rates and the production of statistics. This includes underreporting of births, misclassification of marital status, and other inaccuracies in the data collection process."
