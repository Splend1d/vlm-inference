Generally, a refund can only be claimed if the tax return is filed within three years of the payment of the taxes. This is because the IRS has a three-year statute of limitations for filing tax returns, and any tax paid before this period is considered to be paid in full.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Three years."
