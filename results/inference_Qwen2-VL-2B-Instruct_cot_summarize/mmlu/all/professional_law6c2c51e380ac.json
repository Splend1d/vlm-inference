Shortly thereafter, the woman's financial condition worsened significantly, but she failed to disclose this fact to the bank. Unaware of the woman's changed financial condition, the bank then agreed to lend money to the woman. The bank later learned of the woman's true financial condition. The bank refused to honor its promise to lend money to the woman, contending that the parties' contract was voidable at the bank's option because of the woman's misrepresentation. If the woman sues the bank for breach of contract, will the bank's misrepresentation defense likely succeed?\n\nA. No, because the woman did not make any subsequent affirmative misrepresentations about her financial condition.\nB. No, because the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application to the bank.\nC. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.\nD. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to tell the bank about her changed financial condition due to the longstanding relationship of trust and confidence between them.\n"

The key issue here is whether the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application to the bank. If the representations were accurate, the bank's defense of voidability based on misrepresentation would not be successful. \n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Misrepresentation Definition**: Misrepresentation is a false statement made with the intent to deceive. In this case, the bank's defense relies on the woman's representations being accurate at the time of the loan application.\n\n2. **Accuracy of Representations**: If the representations were accurate at the time of the loan application, the bank would not have grounds to claim that the representations were false or misleading. The bank would have to prove that the representations were false or misleading at a later time, which is not the case here.\n\n3. **Longstanding Relationship**: The bank's relationship with the woman is longstanding, which implies a level of trust and confidence. If the bank had reason to suspect that the woman's financial condition had worsened, it would have had the opportunity to investigate and verify the accuracy of the representations. However, the bank did not have this opportunity, and the representations were accurate at the time of the loan application.\n\n4. **Misrepresentation as a Defense**: The bank's defense of voidability based on misrepresentation would be based on the woman's failure to disclose the changed financial condition to the bank. Since the representations were accurate at the time of the loan application, the bank would not have grounds to claim that the representations were false or misleading.\n\nTherefore, the bank's misrepresentation defense is unlikely to succeed because the representations were accurate at the time of the loan application, and the bank did not have the opportunity to investigate and verify the accuracy of the representations.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because the woman did not make any subsequent affirmative misrepresentations about her financial condition."
