The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's denote the two numbers as $a$ and $b$. We are given that the LCM of $a$ and $b$ is 33, and one of the numbers is 45. We want to find the smallest possible value of the other number $b$.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCD of 45 and 33. The prime factorization of 45 is $3^2 \\cdot 5$ and the prime factorization of 33 is $3 \\cdot 11$. The GCD of 45 and 33 is $3$.\n\nNow, we know that the LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers divided by their GCD. So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} = 33 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{45 \\cdot b}{3} = 33 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 15 \\cdot b = 33 \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{33}{15} \\]\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{11}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ b = 2.2 \\]\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of the other integer $b$ is 2.2. However, the question asks for the smallest possible value of the other integer, which is 2.2. So, the correct answer is D. 9."
