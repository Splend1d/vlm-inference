The expected return is calculated by multiplying the return probability by the return amount.\n\nLet's calculate the expected return for each option:\n\n**Option I:**\n- Return: $25,000\n- Probability: 1 (since it's a sure return)\n\nExpected return for Option I = $25,000 * 1 = $25,000\n\n**Option II:**\n- Return: 50% chance of $50,000 and 50% chance of $10,000\n- Probability: 0.5 (for $50,000) + 0.5 (for $10,000) = 1\n\nExpected return for Option II = 0.5 * $50,000 + 0.5 * $10,000 = $25,000 + $5,000 = $30,000\n\n**Option III:**\n- Return: 5% chance of $100,000 and 95% chance of $0\n- Probability: 0.05 (for $100,000) + 0.95 (for $0) = 1\n\nExpected return for Option III = 0.05 * $100,000 + 0.95 * $0 = $5,000 + $0 = $5,000\n\nNow, let's compare the expected returns:\n\n- Option I: $25,000\n- Option II: $30,000\n- Option III: $5,000\n\nThe company should choose Option I if it wants to maximize expected return, as it has the highest expected return of $30,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Option I if it wants to maximize expected return"
