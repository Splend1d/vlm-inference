Now, we need to express \\(100\\) in terms of powers of \\(3\\). Since \\(100 = 3^2 \\times 10\\), we can rewrite \\(343\\) as \\(3 \\times 3^2 \\times 10\\).\n\n3. Simplifying further, we get \\(343 = 3 \\times 3^2 \\times 10 = 3 \\times 9 \\times 10 = 27 \\times 10 = 270\\).\n\nSo, \\(343\\) is equivalent to \\(270\\) in exponential notation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 294^49**"
