Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as \"partners\" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is\n\nA. only Bob Wilson is liable.\nB. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\nC. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\nD. only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n"

Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Liability**: Pete Smith is seeking advice on the liability of Wilson and Lamar Hardware. The key here is to understand the nature of the partnership and the extent of liability.\n\n2. **Nature of the Partnership**: Wilson and Lamar Hardware are operating as a partnership. In a partnership, each partner is liable for the entire debt of the partnership unless the partner can prove that the other partner is liable only to the extent that the other partner cannot collect the debt.\n\n3. **Reduction in Interest Rate**: Ted Lamar reduced the interest rate from 9% to 8%. This reduction does not affect the nature of the partnership or the liability of the partners. The reduction in interest rate is a matter of business strategy and does not change the legal liability of the partners.\n\n4. **Liability of Wilson and Lamar**: Wilson and Lamar are partners in the partnership. Therefore, they are jointly liable for the entire debt of the partnership. If the debt cannot be collected from Wilson and Lamar, it is their joint liability.\n\n5. **Liability of Pete Smith**: Pete Smith is seeking advice on the liability of Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Since Wilson and Lamar are partners, Pete Smith is not directly liable for the entire debt. Pete Smith is only liable to the extent that the debt cannot be collected from Wilson and Lamar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson."
