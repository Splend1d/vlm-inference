The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it. The pharmacist brought an appropriate action to enjoin the new lease to the discount drugstore as a violationof the covenant in the pharmacist's lease. If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?\n\nA. The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shoppingcenter premises.\nB. A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.\nC. A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.\nD. The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.\n"

The pharmacist leases the drugstore premises from the owner. The owner then acquires a parcel of land adjacent to the shopping center and reconstructs the common facilities to integrate the two centers.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shopping center premises.\"\n     - This option suggests that the lease covenant applies only to the original premises. However, the lease agreement specifies that the owner will not lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. This implies that the lease covenant applies to the entire shopping center, not just the original premises.\n   - **Option B**: \"A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.\"\n     - This option suggests that the lease covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor. However, the lease agreement explicitly restricts the owner from leasing any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. This implies that the lease covenant restricts the use of land not owned by the covenantor.\n   - **Option C**: \"A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.\"\n     - This option suggests that a covenant that restricts competition is invalid. However, the lease agreement explicitly restricts the owner from leasing any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. This implies that the lease covenant does not restrict competition.\n   - **Option D**: \"The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.\"\n     - This option suggests that the lease covenant applies to the entire shopping center, not just the original premises. However, the lease agreement explicitly restricts the owner from leasing any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. This implies that the lease covenant applies to the entire shopping center, not just the original premises.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The lease agreement explicitly restricts the owner from leasing any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Therefore, the lease covenant applies to the entire shopping center, not just the original premises. The court will likely find in favor of the owner because the lease covenant restricts the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created.\n\n**Final Answer**: B. A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created."
