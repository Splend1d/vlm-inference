Hold onto the goods and make the best of them because a business cannot reject goods already approved by a written agreement signed by both parties.\nB. Try the goods out for several months; if they are not going to be satisfactory, then ship them back to the seller who must provide a refund.\nC.

Identify and document the nonconformity, then send the goods back right away.\n\nThis option is the most appropriate because it follows the principles of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the rights of purchasers of goods. The UCC requires that a buyer have the right to reject nonconforming goods within a reasonable time after receiving them. If the buyer does not want to accept and pay for nonconforming goods, they must notify the seller of the nonconformity and demand a refund within a reasonable time. If the seller does not provide a refund, the buyer can then return the goods to the seller and demand a refund."
