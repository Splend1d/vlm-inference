Because the builder was unable to secure enough building contracts to keep all its employees busy during the season beginning March 1, it notified the brick mason on February 15 that it could not afford to employ him as a mason. At the same time, however, the builder offered to employ the mason, for the same contract period, as a night guard at an annual salary of $25,000. The mason declined the offer and remained unemployed during the year. No offer and remained unemployed during the year. No employment for brick masons was available in the community during the year, but the mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year. At the end of the year, in an action against the builder for breach of contract, how much, if anything, is the mason entitled to recover?\n\nA. $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).\nB. $45,000 (the contract price).\nC. Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason.\nD. Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages.\n"

The mason's claim is that the builder failed to fulfill its contract obligations, specifically by not providing employment during the period of the contract.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment): This option is incorrect because the mason did not earn any money in other employment during the year, so the amount claimed is not based on the mason's earnings in other employment.\n\nB. $45,000 (the contract price): This option is incorrect because the mason did not receive any compensation for the period of the contract, so the amount claimed is not based on the contract price.\n\nC. Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason: This option is incorrect because the mason's claim is based on the breach of contract, not on the builder's actions.\n\nD. Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages: This option is incorrect because the mason did not earn any money in other employment during the year, so the amount claimed is not based on the mason's ability to mitigate damages.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment)."
