Exons in protein-coding genes are always coding sequences that encode amino acids for the protein. Noncoding DNA is not part of the exons.\n\nB. The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site.\n- This statement is incorrect. The first exon of a protein-coding gene does not always contain the translational start site. The start site can be located in the second or third exons, depending on the gene structure.\n\nC. The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon.\n- This statement is incorrect. The last exon of a protein-coding gene does not always contain the normal termination codon. The termination codon can be different depending on the gene structure and the protein's function.\n\nD. A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\n- This statement is correct. In most cases, a coding exon is translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames (AUG, UAG, or UAA). However, there are exceptions, such as in certain cases where the reading frame is shifted due to the presence of introns or other regulatory elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
