For an octagon, $n=8$, so the sum of the interior angles is $(8-2) \\times 180 = 5 \\times 180 = 900$ degrees.\n\nAn interior angle of a polygon is the angle between two adjacent sides. In an octagon, each interior angle is one of the angles formed by two adjacent sides. Since an octagon has 8 sides, each interior angle is one of the angles formed by two adjacent sides.\n\nThe measure of each interior angle of an octagon is therefore $900 \\div 8 = 112.5$ degrees.\n\nHowever, this is not an option, so let's try another approach. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon can also be found using the formula $(n-2) \\times 180$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon. For a regular octagon, $n=8$, so the sum of the interior angles is $(8-2) \\times 180 = 6 \\times 180 = 1080$ degrees.\n\nAn interior angle of a regular polygon is the same as the measure of one of the interior angles of the polygon. Since a regular octagon has all sides and angles equal, each interior angle is one of the angles formed by two adjacent sides. Therefore, the measure of each interior angle of a regular octagon is $1080 \\div 8 = 135$ degrees.\n\nSo, the measure of an interior angle of the sign outside Bob's Burger Barn is $\\boxed{135}$ degrees."
