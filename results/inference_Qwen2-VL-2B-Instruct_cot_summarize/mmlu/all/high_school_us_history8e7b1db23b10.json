We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nWould the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era?\n\nA.

Roosevelt):** The Progressive Party was largely opposed to the \"Square Deal\" and did not support it. Therefore, it is unlikely that the platform would be endorsed by supporters of the \"Square Deal.\"\n- **Democrats Advocating Lower Duties:** The platform does not explicitly mention Democrats advocating for lower duties. However, it does not explicitly oppose them either, so it is possible that some Democrats might support the tariff.\n- **Supporters of \"New Nationalism\" (T. Roosevelt):** The platform does not explicitly mention \"New Nationalism\" or any other specific ideology. Therefore, it is unlikely that the platform would be endorsed by supporters of \"New Nationalism.\"\n- **Opponents of Woodrow Wilson:** The platform does not explicitly mention Woodrow Wilson or his policies. Therefore, it is unlikely that the platform would be endorsed by opponents of Woodrow Wilson.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\n**C. No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\"**\n\nThe Progressive Party platform did not explicitly endorse the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913, and it was opposed by many Progressives, including those who were supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism.\""
