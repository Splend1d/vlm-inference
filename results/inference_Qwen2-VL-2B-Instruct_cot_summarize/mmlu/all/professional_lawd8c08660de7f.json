                    "text": "A fumigation company was hired to eliminate pests in one of two buildings in a condominium complex that shared a common wall. The owners of the complex told the fumigation company that the common wall separating the infested building from the uninfested building was an impenetrable fire wall. The fumigation company did its own thorough inspection and determined that the buildings were indeed completely separated by the wall. Residents of the condominium units in the building that was to be sprayed were told to evacuate, but the residents of the uninfested building were told that they could remain while the other building was treated. During and shortly after the fumigation, in which a highly toxic chemical was used, many residents of the uninfested building became sick. It was determined that their illnesses were caused by the fumigation chemical. In fact, there was a hole in the fire wall separating the two buildings, but because it could only be observed from a specific position in the crawl space underneath the floor of the uninfested building, it had not been discovered by either the fumigation company or any previous building inspector. Are the residents of the uninfested building likely to prevail in a tort action against the fumigation company?\n\nA. No, because the condominium complex owners were responsible for accurately conveying the condition of their buildings.\nB. No, because the fumigation company exercised a high level of care.\nC. Yes, because the fumigation company can be held strictly liable for its activity.\nD. Yes, because the fumigation company put a dangerous product into the stream of commerce.\n"

The key issue here is whether the fumigation company can be held strictly liable for its activity.\n\n1. **Careful Inspection and Documentation**: The fumigation company conducted a thorough inspection and determined that the buildings were indeed separated by a fire wall. This indicates that the company took reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the residents.\n\n2. **Failure to Detect**: The hole in the fire wall was discovered only after the chemical was released, and it was not visible from the position where the residents were told to remain. This suggests that the company did not exercise sufficient diligence in their inspection process.\n\n3. **Duty of Care**: The fumigation company is typically held responsible for the safety and health of the public, including those who are exposed to hazardous substances. The failure to detect the hole in the fire wall indicates a breach of duty of care.\n\nGiven these points, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the fumigation company put a dangerous product into the stream of commerce.**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that the company put a dangerous chemical into the stream of commerce, which is a standard basis for liability in tort actions."
