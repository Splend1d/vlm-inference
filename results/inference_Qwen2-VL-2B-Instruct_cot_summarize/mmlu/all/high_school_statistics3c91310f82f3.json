If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: \u03bc = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: \u03bc \u2260 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?\n\nA. A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery\nB. An unnecessary stoppage of the production process\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings\nD. Continued production of proper size ball bearings\n"

A Type II error would result in continued production of wrong size ball bearings, as the engineer would stop production when the null hypothesis is rejected but the alternative hypothesis is not supported.
