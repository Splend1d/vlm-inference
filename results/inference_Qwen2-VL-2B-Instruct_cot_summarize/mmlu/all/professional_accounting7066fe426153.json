The declining percentage is calculated by dividing 2 by the asset's remaining useful life.\n\nIn this case, the asset has a 3-year life, so the declining percentage is 2/3 = 66.67%.\n\nThe book value of the asset at the beginning of the year is $12000 - $1500 = $10500.\n\nThe depreciation expense for the year is calculated by multiplying the book value by the declining percentage:\n\nDepreciation expense = $10500 * 66.67% = $68,888.67\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, the depreciation expense is $68,888.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $68,888"
