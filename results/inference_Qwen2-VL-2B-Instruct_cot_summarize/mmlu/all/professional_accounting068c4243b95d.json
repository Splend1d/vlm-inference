The annual operating expenses are $7,000. The depreciation expense, included in the operating expenses, is $4,000 per year.\n\nThe total annual revenue from the machine is:\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = \\text{Annual Operating Expenses} + \\text{Depreciation Expense} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Annual Revenue} = \\$7,000 + \\$4,000 = \\$11,000 \\]\n\nThe total annual cost of the machine is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Annual Cost} = \\text{Annual Revenue} + \\text{Depreciation Expense} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Annual Cost} = \\$11,000 + \\$4,000 = \\$15,000 \\]\n\nThe total cost of the machine over the seven-year period is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Annual Cost} \\times \\text{Number of Years} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\$15,000 \\times 7 = \\$105,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the company paid $105,000 for the new machine.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. $145,600"
