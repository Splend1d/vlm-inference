The gift violates the establishment clause.\n\nThe establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or from promoting any particular religion. The religious organization in question is using the buses to spread the moral message of sexual abstinence, which is a religious message. This directly violates the establishment clause, as it promotes a religious message and aligns with the religious beliefs of the religious organization.\n\nThe other options are less strong:\n\nA. The gift violates the equal protection rights of secular organizations.\n- This option is not directly relevant to the issue of religious expression and does not address the specific violation of the establishment clause.\n\nC. The gift is a taking of federal property without just compensation.\n- This option is also not directly relevant to the issue of religious expression and does not address the specific violation of the establishment clause.\n\nD. The gift violates the commerce clause.\n- This option is not directly relevant to the issue of religious expression and does not address the specific violation of the establishment clause.\n\nTherefore, the strongest constitutional grounds for invalidating the gift of the buses to the religious organization are those related to the establishment clause."
