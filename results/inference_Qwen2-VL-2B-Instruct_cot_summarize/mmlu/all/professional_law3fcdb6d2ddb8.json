It further provides that the maximum punishment increases to 10 years in prison if the defendant possessed a deadly weapon during the assault. The statute designates the deadly weapon element as a sentencing factor. A defendant charged with assault has pleaded not guilty and has requested a jury trial. The prosecutor has announced that she will be seeking a 10- year sentence based on the defendant's alleged possession of a deadly weapon. What finding regarding the defendant's possession of a deadly weapon is necessary for the court to impose a 10-year sentence?\n\nA. A judicial finding by a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. A jury finding by a preponderance of the evidence.\nC. A judicial finding beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. A jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt.\n"

A jury finding by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nThe statute provides that the maximum punishment for assault increases to 10 years in prison if the defendant possessed a deadly weapon. This is a sentencing factor, which means it is a factor that the court can consider when determining the sentence. For the maximum sentence to be imposed, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed a deadly weapon during the assault. This is a higher standard than the preponderance of the evidence standard, which is used to determine whether the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the prosecutor must prove the defendant's possession of a deadly weapon beyond a reasonable doubt for the court to impose a 10-year sentence."
