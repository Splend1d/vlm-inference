If a practice is risker than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.\n\nThis is because harm arguments against homosexuality often assume that certain practices are inherently immoral or imprudent, regardless of the risks involved. This is a problematic \"hidden assumption\" because it assumes that the morality or prudence of a practice is solely determined by its riskiness, rather than by other factors such as the consequences of the practice or the potential benefits it may offer."
