This action is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Refilling a bottle with a different substance is generally considered a harmless and non-moral act.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) kept a distance from an ambulance. This action is also not clearly morally wrong. Keeping a distance from an emergency vehicle is generally considered a safe and responsible behavior, as it allows for proper emergency response and avoids potential harm to oneself or others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
