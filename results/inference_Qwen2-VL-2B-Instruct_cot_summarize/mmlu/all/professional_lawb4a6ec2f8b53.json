For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n"

The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nIn the context of intestate succession, the will of a deceased person is the primary document that determines the distribution of their estate. The will specifies that the woman's farm is to be divided between her nephew and her niece, with the residue of her estate to be divided between them. This means that the niece is the residuary legatee, inheriting the remaining portion of the estate after the nephew's share is distributed.\n\nThe doctrine of residuary legatee refers to the principle that the last will and testament of a deceased person is the ultimate disposition of their estate, and the residuary legatee is the person who is entitled to receive the remaining portion of the estate after all other legacies have been distributed. In this case, the niece is the residuary legatee, and she is entitled to the remainder of the estate after the nephew's share is distributed.\n\nTherefore, the niece is the owner of the home, as she is the residuary legatee and the only person who is entitled to receive the remaining portion of the estate after the nephew's share is distributed."
