We can do this by dividing the total number of parts produced by the total hours taken to produce those parts.\n\nGiven that the worker takes 7 hours to produce 22 parts, the production rate per hour is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Production rate per hour} = \\frac{22 \\text{ parts}}{7 \\text{ hours}} = 3 \\text{ parts per hour} \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many parts the worker can produce in 35 hours, we multiply the production rate per hour by the number of hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Parts produced in 35 hours} = 3 \\text{ parts per hour} \\times 35 \\text{ hours} = 105 \\text{ parts} \\]\n\nTherefore, the worker can produce 105 parts in 35 hours, which corresponds to option D."
