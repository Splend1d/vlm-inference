The perfect squares of odd numbers are of the form \\(n^2\\), where \\(n\\) is an odd number. The smallest odd perfect square greater than 5 is \\(3^2 = 9\\), and the largest odd perfect square less than 211 is \\(15^2 = 225\\).\n\nWe need to find the odd perfect squares in this range. The odd perfect squares are \\(9, 25, 49, 81, 121\\). Therefore, there are 5 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 6."
