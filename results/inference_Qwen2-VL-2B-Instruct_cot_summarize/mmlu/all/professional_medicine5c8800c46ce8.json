Increased peripheral vascular resistance\n\nIncreased peripheral vascular resistance can lead to a higher blood pressure in a patient with normal cardiac output and normal pulse. This is because the resistance to blood flow through the peripheral vessels increases, which can cause the heart to work harder to maintain blood pressure."
