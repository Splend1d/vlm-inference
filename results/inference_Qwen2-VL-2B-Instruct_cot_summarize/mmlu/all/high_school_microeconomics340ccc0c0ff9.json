An effective price ceiling must be at a price below the equilibrium price.\n\nA price ceiling is a government-imposed limit on the maximum price that a seller can charge for a good or service. If the price ceiling is set at a price below the equilibrium price, it will lead to a shortage of the good, as the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. This shortage will drive up the price of the good above the price ceiling, leading to a surplus. The price ceiling will not be effective if it is set at a price above the equilibrium price, as it will not lead to a shortage or surplus."
