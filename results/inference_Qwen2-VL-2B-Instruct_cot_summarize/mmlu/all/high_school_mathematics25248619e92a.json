Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[C(15, 5) = \\frac{15!}{5!(15-5)!} = \\frac{15!}{5!10!}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{120}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{120}\\]\n\n\\[= 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11\\]\n\n\\[= 2,580,300\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible committees of 5 people that can be chosen from a group of 15 people is 2,580,300, which corresponds to option D."
