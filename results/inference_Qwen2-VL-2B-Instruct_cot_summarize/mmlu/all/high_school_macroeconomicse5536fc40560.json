The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nWhen the demand for a product falls while the supply simultaneously increases, the market will shift to the right on the demand curve, leading to a higher equilibrium quantity. However, the equilibrium price itself is not affected by the changes in demand and supply. The equilibrium price remains constant until the supply curve intersects the demand curve at the new equilibrium point. Once the intersection occurs, the equilibrium price will be determined by the intersection point on the demand curve."
