We are given that $x < y$ and $xy = 56$.\n\nWe are also given that $7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} + 14 \\cdot \\frac{1}{y} = 4$.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation. We can rewrite $7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}$ as $\\frac{7}{x}$ and $14 \\cdot \\frac{1}{y}$ as $\\frac{14}{y}$, so the equation becomes $\\frac{7}{x} + \\frac{14}{y} = 4$.\n\nMultiplying through by $xy$ to clear the fractions gives $7y + 14x = 4xy$.\n\nWe know that $xy = 56$, so we can substitute that into the equation to get $7y + 14x = 4 \\cdot 56 = 224$.\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n1. $x + y = \\frac{56}{x}$\n2. $7y + 14x = 224$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. First, let's solve the first equation for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \\frac{56}{x} - x$.\n\nNow substitute this into the second equation: $7y + 14x = 224$ becomes $7(\\frac{56}{x} - x) + 14x = 224$.\n\nSimplify the equation: $7 \\cdot \\frac{56}{x} - 7x + 14x = 224$, which simplifies to $7 \\cdot \\frac{56}{x} + 7x = 224$.\n\nMultiply through by $x$ to clear the fraction: $7 \\cdot 56 + 7x^2 = 224x$.\n\nSimplify the left side: $392 + 7x^2 = 224x$.\n\nRearrange the equation to get all terms on one side: $7x^2 - 224x + 392 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 7$, $b = -224$, and $c = 392$.\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n\nSubstitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula: $x = \\frac{224 \\pm \\sqrt{(-224)^2 - 4 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 392}}{2 \\cdot 7}$.\n\nSimplify the expression under the square root: $x = \\frac{224 \\pm \\sqrt{4896 - 11688}}{14}$.\n\nSimplify further: $x = \\frac{224 \\pm \\sqrt{-6792}}{14}$.\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made a mistake in our calculations. The correct quadratic formula should be $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, not $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2}$.\n\nLet's correct this and solve the equation again.\n\nThe correct quadratic formula is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n\nSubstitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula: $x = \\frac{224 \\pm \\sqrt{(-224)^2 - 4 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 392}}{2 \\cdot 7}$.\n\nSimplify the expression under the square root: $x = \\frac{224 \\pm \\sqrt{4896 - 11688}}{14}$.\n\nSimplify further: $x = \\frac{224 \\pm \\sqrt{-6792}}{14}$.\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.
