The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\nB. that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.\nC. that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\nD. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n"

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the options provided:\n\n1. **Identify the Context and Issue**: The context is a dispute over subdividing land, specifically parcels of 250 acres, with a restriction that any further subdivisions must be restricted to minimum two-acre lots. The issue is whether the restriction is enforceable and whether the contractor's subdivision plan is valid.\n\n2. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **Option A**: \"that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\"\n     - This option suggests that the owners of the lots in tract 1 do not have the legal standing to sue. However, the restriction in the original deed is binding on subsequent grantees, and the owners are the original grantees. Therefore, they have standing to sue.\n   - **Option B**: \"that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.\"\n     - This option suggests that the owners lack privity of estate with the contractor. However, the original deed restricts subdividing to minimum two-acre lots, and the contractor followed this restriction. Therefore, privity of estate is not an issue.\n   - **Option C**: \"that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\"\n     - This option suggests that the court should consider tract 2 as part of a common development scheme. However, the restriction in the original deed is specific to tract 1, and tract 2 is not part of the same development scheme.\n   - **Option D**: \"that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\"\n     - This option suggests that the restrictions in the original deed will be enforceable. However, the restriction is specific to tract 1 and does not apply to tract 2.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The most probable judicial determination would be that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable. The restriction is specific to tract 1 and does not apply to tract 2, which is not part of the same development scheme.\n\n**Final Answer**: D. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable."
