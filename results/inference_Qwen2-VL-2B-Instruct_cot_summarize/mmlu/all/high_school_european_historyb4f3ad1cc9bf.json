And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. \u2026\nWhensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.\nJohn Locke, Second Treatise of Government, 1690\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Locke believed a government loses its legitimacy when\n\nA. it is weak and can be overthrown\nB. when the people wish to change governors\nC. when it becomes corrupt\nD. it tries to exercise absolute power\n"
