When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.\n\u2014Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500\u20131000 BCE\nWhich of the following statements is supported by the information in the passage above?\n\nA. The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period.\nB. The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability.\nC. The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders.\nD. The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement is supported by the information in the passage, let's analyze the context and core of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the Purusa-Sukta, a ritualistic offering in Hinduism, and its significance in the creation of the world and the formation of the caste system. Here's a breakdown of the passage:\n\n1. **Purusa-Sukta**: This ritual involves offering food to the gods, which is believed to bring forth various elements of the world.\n2. **Birth of Purusa**: Purusa is born from the offering, and this birth is associated with the creation of the world.\n3. **Caste System**: The passage mentions the creation of the world through the sacrifice of Purusa, and the gods apportion him into different castes (Brahman, Rajanaya, Vaisya, Sudra) based on his attributes.\n4. **World Formation**: The gods sacrifice with the sacrifice to the sacrifice, indicating a ritualistic and interconnected system.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period.**\n   - The passage does not explicitly state that the caste system was purely social. It mentions that the gods apportioned Purusa into different castes based on his attributes, which suggests a more complex system than a simple social construct.\n\nB. **The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability.**\n   - The passage does not provide information about regional princes or their role in reinforcing social stability. It focuses more on the ritualistic aspects and the creation of the world.\n\nC. **The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders.**\n   - The passage does not discuss the impact of the caste system on Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders. It primarily focuses on the creation of the world and the formation of the caste system.\n\nD. **The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.**\n   - The passage clearly states that the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, which is believed to bring forth various elements of the world. This suggests that the caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is supported by the information in the passage is:\n\n**D. The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.**"
