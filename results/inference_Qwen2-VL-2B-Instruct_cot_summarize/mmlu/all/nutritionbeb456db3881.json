Such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used\n\nAnimal toxicity studies are typically conducted with much smaller numbers of animals compared to human toxicity studies. This is because the goal of animal toxicity studies is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a substance, which is the highest dose that can be administered to a group of animals without causing any observable toxicity. The MTD is used to determine the maximum safe dose that can be used in human studies. Therefore, the doses used in animal toxicity studies are usually many times greater than those experienced by people because only small numbers of animals can be used to detect the potential toxicity of a substance."
