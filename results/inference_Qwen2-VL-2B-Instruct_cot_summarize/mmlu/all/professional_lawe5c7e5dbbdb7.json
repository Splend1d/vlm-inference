They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, \"I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder.\" The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n"

The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **The Man and His Brother**: They agreed on a plan to murder the neighbor, which involves strychnine poisoning. They went to get the poison and planned the act. This indicates that they were involved in the planning and execution of the murder, which is the essence of conspiracy.\n\n2. **The Friend**: The friend was only there for planning and advice, not for committing the murder. He refused to go forward with the plan and was not involved in the actual act of poisoning. Therefore, he is not guilty of murder.\n\n3. **Statute**: The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Since the man and his brother were involved in the planning and execution of the murder, they are guilty of conspiracy. The friend's refusal to go forward with the plan does not negate his involvement in the conspiracy but does not make him guilty of murder.\n\nThus, the man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, while the friend is not guilty of murder."
