This is because the regularization term penalizes the model for having large weights, which can lead to a decrease in the bias of the model. The variance of the model will increase as the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient increases. This is because the regularization term also penalizes the model for having small weights, which can lead to an increase in the variance of the model. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
