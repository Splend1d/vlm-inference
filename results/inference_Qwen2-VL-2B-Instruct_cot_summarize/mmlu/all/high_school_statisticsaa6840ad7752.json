Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\]\n\n2. **Mutually exclusive events**: Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur at the same time. This means that if one event occurs, the other cannot occur. However, independent events do not necessarily imply that they are mutually exclusive. For example, if A and B are independent, it does not mean that A and B cannot occur simultaneously.\n\n3. **Conditional probability**: The conditional probability \\( P(A|B) \\) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. Similarly, \\( P(B|A) \\) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred. These are not necessarily equal, as the probability of A given B is not necessarily equal to the probability of B given A.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B)**: This is true because if A and B are independent, then the probability of both A and B occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. This is a direct consequence of the definition of independence.\n\nB. **A and B may or may not be mutually exclusive**: This is not necessarily true. Independent events do not necessarily imply that they are mutually exclusive. For example, if A and B are independent, they can still occur simultaneously.\n\nC. **A and B must be mutually exclusive**: This is not necessarily true. Independent events do not necessarily imply that they are mutually exclusive. For example, if A and B are independent, they can still occur simultaneously.\n\nD. **P(A| B) = P(B| A)**: This is not necessarily true. The conditional probabilities \\( P(A|B) \\) and \\( P(B|A) \\) are not necessarily equal. For example, if A and B are independent, \\( P(A|B) \\) and \\( P(B|A) \\) can be different.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is true is:\n\n**A. P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B)**"
