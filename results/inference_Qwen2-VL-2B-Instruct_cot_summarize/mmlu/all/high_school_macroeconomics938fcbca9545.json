There exist many unemployed resources so that output can be increased without increasing wages and prices.\n\nIn the short run, the aggregate supply curve is horizontal because there are many unemployed resources. This means that the economy can produce more output without having to increase wages or prices, as the increase in output can be absorbed by the existing supply of labor and capital. This is because the economy is not fully utilized, and there is excess capacity in the labor and capital markets."
