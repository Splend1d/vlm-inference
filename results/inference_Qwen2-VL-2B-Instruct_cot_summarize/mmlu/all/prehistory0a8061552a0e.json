They thought sub-Saharan Africans were incapable of such achievements.\n\nArchaeologists have long suggested that the walls of Great Zimbabwe could not have been built by an indigenous sub-Saharan people because they believed that the architectural style and techniques used in the construction of the walls were too advanced and sophisticated for an indigenous population. The walls are characterized by their elaborate stonework, the use of large stones, and the presence of symbolic motifs that are not commonly found in sub-Saharan African art. These features are typically associated with advanced civilizations, such as Egypt or the ancient Near East, which were known for their advanced technology and architectural achievements. Therefore, the most plausible reason for the archaeologists' belief that the walls of Great Zimbabwe could not have been built by an indigenous sub-Saharan people was that they thought sub-Saharan Africans were incapable of such achievements."
