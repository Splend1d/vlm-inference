Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Acting virtuously means acting in a way that is informed about what one is doing and why.**\n   - This option suggests that virtue is about understanding one's actions and why they are done. While it touches on the idea of understanding, it does not directly address the core argument about the necessity of understanding existence principles.\n\nB. **Someone who does not understand existence philosophically could never do anything right.**\n   - This option implies that understanding existence is necessary for doing anything right. However, it does not directly address the core argument about the value of life.\n\nC. **To have the power or ability to do anything at all requires that we know what we are doing.**\n   - This option suggests that knowing what one is doing is essential for doing anything. While it touches on the idea of knowing one's actions, it does not directly address the core argument about the value of life.\n\nD. **Not only is virtue knowledge but also the unexamined life is not worth living.**\n   - This option directly addresses the core argument by stating that understanding existence principles is necessary for living virtuously. It emphasizes that the unexamined life (living without understanding existence principles) is not worth living.\n\nAfter careful analysis, option D is the most accurate representation of Socrates' argument.\n\nFinal answer: **D. Not only is virtue knowledge but also the unexamined life is not worth living.**"
