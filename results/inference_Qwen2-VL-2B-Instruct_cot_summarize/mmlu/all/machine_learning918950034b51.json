The initial choice of weights\n\nThis is because the initial weights of the neurons in the neural network can significantly influence the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. If the initial weights are too large or too small, the model may overfit the training data, while if they are too small, the model may underfit the data. Therefore, choosing appropriate initial weights is crucial for achieving a good balance between bias and variance in the model."
