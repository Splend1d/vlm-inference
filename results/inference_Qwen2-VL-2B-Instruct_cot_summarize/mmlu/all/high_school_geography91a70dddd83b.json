Defining criteria are subjective and differ among researchers.\n\nPerceptual or vernacular regions are often difficult to identify because the defining criteria are subjective and can vary among researchers. This means that different people may have different perceptions of what constitutes a region, and these perceptions may not always align with scientific definitions. Additionally, the boundaries of regions can be constantly changing due to factors such as natural disasters, human activities, and shifting cultural boundaries."
