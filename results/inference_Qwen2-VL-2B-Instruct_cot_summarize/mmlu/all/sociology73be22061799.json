They referred to explicit, context independent meanings.\n\nBernstein believed that using restricted codes of language, which refer to explicit, context-independent meanings, can lead to a lack of understanding and communication among children. This can result in a disconnect between the child's understanding of the language and the language itself, making it difficult for children to communicate effectively outside of their peer groups."
