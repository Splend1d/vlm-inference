This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves the displacement of people who are in need and the use of the building for a purpose that is not aligned with its original purpose. In Scenario 2, the main character soiled their grandparents' laundry. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a private matter and does not involve any harm to others or a violation of any moral standards."
