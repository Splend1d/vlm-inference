Let's break down each action:\n\n1. **Consensual sexual intercourse with his sister**: This action is generally considered a violation of societal norms regarding sexual consent and privacy. It is considered taboo because it goes against the expectations of what is considered appropriate behavior in a relationship.\n\n2. **Leaves no tip at the bar**: This action is considered taboo because it goes against the expectation of tipping at bars, which is a common practice in many cultures to show appreciation for service.\n\n3. **Non-censual sexual relations with an unknown woman**: This action is considered taboo because it goes against the expectation of sexual relationships outside of a committed relationship, which is generally considered inappropriate.\n\n4. **Vomits on the steps to the door of a local church**: This action is considered taboo because it goes against the expectation of behavior in public places, especially in religious institutions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the actions are ordered from the greatest degree of violation of societal norms to the least degree:\n\nA. mores, mores, the law, mores\nB. taboo, folkways, the law, and taboo\nC. the law, folkways, folkways, and folkways\nD. taboo, folkways, the law, and mores\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. taboo, folkways, the law, and taboo"
