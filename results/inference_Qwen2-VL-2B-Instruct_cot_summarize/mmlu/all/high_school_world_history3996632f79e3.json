But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's efforts to advance Russia as justified by his mention of the \"continual beatings\" were vindicated by which of the following historical events?\n\nA. The Space Race with the United States\nB. The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s\nC. The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War\nD. The German invasion of Russia in 1941\n"

The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s.\n\nThe passage describes the historical context of Russia's backwardness and the constant beatings it suffered from various exploiters, including the Mongol khans, Turkish beys, Swedish feudal lords, Polish and Lithuanian gentry, British and French capitalists, and Japanese barons. Stalin's speech emphasizes the need to no longer lag behind, implying that the Soviet Union's efforts to advance and overcome its backwardness were justified by the historical context of being repeatedly beaten by these exploiters.\n\nThe Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s was a significant event that demonstrated the Soviet Union's military and political strength, which was seen as a direct response to the beatings it had received from various exploiters. This event was a turning point in the Soviet Union's history and contributed to the justification of Stalin's efforts to advance Russia."
