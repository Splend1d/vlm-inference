The atomic radius of an element is the distance between the nucleus and the center of the atom.\n\nBased on the periodic trends, we can expect that the ionization energy of sodium will be higher than that of magnesium. This is because sodium has a higher atomic number than magnesium, which means it has a higher number of electrons in its valence shell. Therefore, the ionization energy of sodium will be higher than that of magnesium.\n\nThe atomic radius of sodium is expected to be smaller than that of magnesium. This is because sodium has a smaller atomic radius than magnesium, which means it has a smaller number of electrons in its valence shell. Therefore, the atomic radius of sodium will be smaller than that of magnesium.\n\nTherefore, the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium are:\n\nA. 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol\nB. 186 pm, 898 kJ/mol\nC. 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol\nD. 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol"
