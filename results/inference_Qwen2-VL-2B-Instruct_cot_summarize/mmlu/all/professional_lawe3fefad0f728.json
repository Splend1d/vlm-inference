The worker brought a federal diversity action against both the machine's manufacturer and the company responsible for the machine's maintenance. At trial, the worker submitted a proposed jury instruction on negligence. The court did not accept the proposed instruction and instead gave a negligence instruction that the worker's attorney believed was less favorable and legally incorrect. The attorney did not object to the negligence instruction before it was given. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. The worker has moved for a new trial on the ground that the court's negligence instruction was improper. What argument has the best chance of persuading the court to grant the motion?\n\nA. Issues of law can be raised at any time.\nB. The court's negligence instruction was incorrect and the worker's objection to it was preserved when he submitted his it was preserved when he submitted his proposed negligence instruction.\nC. The court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights.\nD. The need for a formal objection to a judicial ruling in order to preserve an argument has been eliminated in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n"

The court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that a plain error occurs when the error is so obvious and significant that it would have been plain to the court to have caught it if it had been made. In this case, the negligence instruction was given without the worker having had an opportunity to object to it, which would have been a clear error. The plain error doctrine allows for a new trial if the error was so obvious that it would have been plain to the court to have caught it if it had been made. Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a new trial."
