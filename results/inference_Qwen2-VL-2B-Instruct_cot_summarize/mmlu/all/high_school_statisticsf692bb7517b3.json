This means that the true slope of the regression line is likely between 0.45 and 0.80. Therefore, it is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables, as a positive correlation would result in a positive slope and a negative correlation would result in a negative slope.\n\nHowever, the confidence interval does not provide information about the strength of the linear relationship. It only tells us that the slope is likely between 0.45 and 0.80, but it does not give us information about the strength of the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
