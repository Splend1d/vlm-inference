In the context of the piano teacher's method, the student is rewarded for playing correct notes, which is a simpler behavior, and then the teacher rewards the student for adding proper dynamics and interpretation to the segments he plays, which is a more complex behavior. This method helps the student to gradually improve and master the piece."
