It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nWhich of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above?\n\nA.

He criticizes the Romanists for their three walls around themselves and the lack of jurisdiction over the spiritual matters. He also mentions the destruction of the service of God by the creation of cardinals and the endowments, convents, fiefs, and benefices.\n\nLet's analyze each reformer's views:\n\nA. Ulrich Zwingli - Zwingli was a Swiss reformer who opposed the Roman Catholic Church and the Counter-Reformation. He believed in the authority of the Bible and the need for a council to address religious disputes. His views were more aligned with Zwingli's than Luther's.\n\nB. Sir Thomas More - Sir Thomas More was an English reformer who opposed the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church. He believed in the authority of the Bible and the need for a council to address religious disputes. His views were more aligned with More's than Luther's.\n\nC. Erasmus - Erasmus was a Dutch reformer who opposed the Church of Rome and the Counter-Reformation. He believed in the authority of the Bible and the need for a council to address religious disputes. His views were more aligned with Erasmus's than Luther's.\n\nD. John Wycliffe - John Wycliffe was an English reformer who opposed the Church of Rome and the Counter-Reformation. He believed in the authority of the Bible and the need for a council to address religious disputes. His views were more aligned with Wycliffe's than Luther's.\n\nBased on the analysis, the reformer who expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above is:\n\nC.
