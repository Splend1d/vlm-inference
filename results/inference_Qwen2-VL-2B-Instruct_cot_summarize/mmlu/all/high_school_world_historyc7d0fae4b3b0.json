They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1750\u20131900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA.

The Portuguese trade with China and Japan:\n   - They carried white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain.\n   - They brought silver from Japan but nothing else.\n   - They used silver from Japan to trade with China.\n   - They brought gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and other costly goods from India to China.\n\n2. The trade patterns:\n   - The Portuguese carried goods from China to Japan.\n and vice versa.\n   - They used silver from Japan to trade with China.\n\n3. The period of interest:\n   - 1750\u20131900 C.E.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants:\n   - This would imply that the Chinese were more interested in European goods than the Portuguese. This would undid the trade patterns by shifting the balance of trade in favor of the Chinese.\n\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas:\n   - These revolutions did not directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. They were more focused on political and social changes rather than economic trade patterns.\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution:\n   - The Industrial Revolution did not significantly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. It was a technological and economic shift that led to increased trade and economic growth, but it did not fundamentally change the trade patterns.\n\nD. The colonization of Africa:\n   - The colonization of Africa did not undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. It was a geopolitical shift that led to the establishment of colonies and trade networks, but it did not fundamentally change the trade patterns.\n\nBased on the analysis, the development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is:\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants"
