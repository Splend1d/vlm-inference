However, the moral implications of these actions vary significantly.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the character is giving their brother a substance (turpentine) that is harmful to the environment and can cause harm to the person who uses it. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the character is using a substance (pepper spray) that is illegal and can cause harm to others. This action is also clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in both scenarios, but the specific actions differ in terms of the substance used and the harm caused."
