The release of insulin after eating a meal will slow the emptying of the stomach\nC. At the start of a meal, the stomach increases its \"tone\" in order to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus\nD. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility\n"

The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for peristaltic movement of food after a meal has been consumed\n\nIntestinal motility is a complex process that involves the coordinated actions of nerves, hormones, and the presence of food in the stomach. The migrating motor complex (MMC) is a group of neurons that play a crucial role in peristaltic movements, which are the rhythmic contractions that propel food through the digestive tract. These movements are responsible for the emptying of the stomach and intestines after a meal. Therefore, statement A is the correct answer."
