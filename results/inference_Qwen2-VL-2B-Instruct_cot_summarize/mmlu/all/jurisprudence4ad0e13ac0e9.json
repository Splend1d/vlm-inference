It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule.\n\nHart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is a fundamental concept in legal philosophy that helps to clarify the nature of legal obligations. It suggests that obligations are not simply internal to the individual, but are also external, requiring the individual to act in a certain way. This distinction helps to clarify the role of morality in law and the nature of legal rules."
