If the number of numbers is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nGiven set of data: 13, 35, 26, 8, 24, 10, 22, 10, 32\n\nFirst, arrange the numbers in ascending order: 8, 10, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 35, 32\n\nSince there are 9 numbers, which is an odd number, the median is the middle number, which is 22.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 22."
