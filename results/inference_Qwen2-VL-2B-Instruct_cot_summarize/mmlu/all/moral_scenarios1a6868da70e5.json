However, the act of putting on roller skates in a skating rink is not inherently wrong, but it can be seen as a minor violation of the rules of the skating rink, such as not wearing appropriate footwear or not being in the designated skating area.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character attacked the home invader. Attacking someone is generally considered morally wrong, as it involves the use of force to harm another person. This is a clear violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
