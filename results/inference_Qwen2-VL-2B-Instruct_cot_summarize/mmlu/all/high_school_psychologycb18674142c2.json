The experiment involved presenting infants with a visual cliff, which is a narrow gap between two levels of a wall. Infants were shown a series of pictures of objects placed at different distances from the cliff, and they were asked to indicate which objects were closer or farther away. The results showed that infants were able to accurately judge the distance of objects based on their visual cues, even before they had learned to crawl. This experiment provided evidence that infants are capable of perceiving depth and distance using visual cues, which is consistent with the findings of other studies on infant perception."
