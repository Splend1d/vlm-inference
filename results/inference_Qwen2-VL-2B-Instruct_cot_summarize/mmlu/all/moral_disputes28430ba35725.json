The problem that the bad effects of current carbon dioxide emissions will fall largely on future generations.\n\nThe \"intergenerational storm\" of climate change refers to the potential for the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions to harm future generations more than current generations. This is because the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and extreme weather events, are not evenly distributed across generations. The current generation is responsible for the emissions that will cause these effects, but future generations will be the ones to suffer from them. This is known as the \"intergenerational storm\" because it highlights the potential for future generations to be disproportionately affected by the consequences of current actions."
