The electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of superposition, which states that the electric field due to a charged object can be found by adding the electric fields due to each charge individually. In this case, the electric field due to the surface charge density is the sum of the electric fields due to each individual charge on the surface of the object. The electric field due to the surface charge density is also proportional to the surface charge density, which is directly proportional to the charge density on the surface of the object. Therefore, the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space."
