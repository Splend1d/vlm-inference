If PED is greater than 1, the demand is price elastic; if PED is less than 1, the demand is price inelastic; if PED is exactly 1, the demand is unitary elastic.\n\n2. **Cross-Price Elasticity:** The cross-price elasticity measures the responsiveness of one good's quantity demanded to a change in the price of another good. If the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero, the two goods are substitutes; if it is less than zero, they are complements.\n\nGiven the information:\n- The price of firm A's cell phone service rises by 5 percent.\n- The quantity demanded for firm B's cell phone service increases by 10 percent.\n\nSince the price of firm A's service rises, the quantity demanded for firm B's service increases, which means the cross-price elasticity between the two services is greater than zero. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero."
