A unilateral contract is one where one party (the one who offers the contract) is the only one who can terminate the contract. In this case, the note under the door was offered by the man, who was the one who wanted to hire the neighbor to mow his lawn. Therefore, the court would most likely find that the note was a unilateral contract.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. the neighbor's mowing of the lawn created a unilateral contract."
