Recognition of governments is very prevalent in contemporary practice\n\nRecognition of governments is a fundamental principle in international law, particularly in the context of international relations and diplomacy. Governments are often recognized by other states for their sovereignty, territorial integrity, and adherence to international law. This recognition is often based on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and the principle of equality and mutual respect."
