This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves using the police to resolve a conflict between the teacher and the student, which is not a legitimate use of the police's services. In Scenario 2, the main character took their customer's checkbook and went shopping. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a private matter and does not involve any harm or wrongdoing to others."
