Her job responsibilities included preparing new course outlines, proofreading and grading student homework assignments. The bar review course agreed to pay the graduate a starting salary of $2,500 a month. Three months later, the graduate was approached by the regional director of the bar review course, who handed her a newly published 60-page booklet entitled \"Employment Manual. \" He instructed the graduate to read the manual and indicated that it contained important information concerning company policy considerations and employee benefits. When the graduate returned home that evening, she started to read the manual. After reading about 30 pages, the graduate became tired and went to sleep. She never got around to reading the rest of the manual. Six months later, the graduate received a termination notice from the bar review course. The notice indicated that the graduate was being fired for insubordination because she had complained about the poor quality of the bar review course's materials and refused to work overtime grading papers. Following her dismissal, the graduate brought suit against the bar review course for breach of contract. Which of the following, if true and provable, would furnish the bar review course with its best defense?\n\nA. All other bar review course employees worked overtime whenever requested to do so.\nB. When the graduate accepted employment with the bar review course, the company never made any promises regarding job security or duration of employment.\nC. The materials in the bar review course had recently been reviewed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education and had received \"high acclaim. \"\nD. The second page of the bar review course manual contained a paragraph stating that all policies, guidelines and employee benefits are \"purely gratuitous and not intended to create any ongoing contractual obligation. \"\n"

                    "text": "To determine the best defense for the bar review course, we need to analyze each option to see which one provides a plausible explanation for the graduate's termination and the bar review course's liability.\n\n**Option A: All other bar review course employees worked overtime whenever requested to do so.**\n- This option suggests that the graduate's termination was due to a lack of job security and not because of her own actions. However, it does not directly address the issue of the graduate's failure to read the \"Employment Manual\" and her subsequent actions.\n\n**Option B: When the graduate accepted employment with the bar review course, the company never made any promises regarding job security or duration of employment.**\n- This option suggests that the bar review course did not provide the graduate with any job security or duration of employment. This could be a strong defense because it implies that the graduate's termination was due to the bar review course's failure to fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\n**Option C: The materials in the bar review course had recently been reviewed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education and had received \"high acclaim. \"\n- This option highlights the quality of the materials but does not directly address the graduate's failure to read the \"Employment Manual\" or her subsequent actions.\n\n**Option D: The second page of the bar review course manual contained a paragraph stating that all policies, guidelines and employee benefits are \"purely gratuitous and not intended to create any ongoing contractual obligation. \"\n- This option suggests that the bar review course's policies and guidelines are not binding and do not create any contractual obligations. However, it does not explain why the graduate was terminated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B provides the best defense for the bar review course because it directly addresses the graduate's termination and the bar review course's failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. The graduate's failure to read the \"Employment Manual\" and her subsequent actions were the result of the bar review course's failure to provide job security and duration of employment, which led to her termination.\n\nTherefore, the bar review course's best defense would be:\n\n**Final Answer: B. When the graduate accepted employment with the bar review course, the company never made any promises regarding job security or duration of employment.**"
