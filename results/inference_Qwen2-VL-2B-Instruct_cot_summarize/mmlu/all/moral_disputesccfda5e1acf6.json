Kamm does not claim that genetic transformation will strengthen the bond between parent and child; rather, he argues that genetic enhancement should be considered as a legitimate and morally permissible way to improve the quality of life for individuals, including parents and children.\n\n   - **Option B:** \"children are too young to understand the implications of genetic enhancement.\"\n     - This option is not relevant to Kamm's argument. Kamm does not address the age of children and their understanding of genetic enhancement; he focuses on the moral and ethical implications of genetic enhancement.\n\n   - **Option C:** \"Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\"\n     - This option is not directly addressed by Kamm's argument. Kamm does not argue that Sandel's reasoning does not rule out moderate, worthwhile genetic enhancement; he argues that genetic enhancement should be considered as a legitimate and morally permissible way to improve the quality of life for individuals, including parents and children.\n\n   - **Option D:** \"the use of training and appliances as a way of transforming gifts is not, as Sandel argues, morally permissible.\"\n     - This option is not directly addressed by Kamm's argument. Kamm does not argue that the use of training and appliances is morally permissible; he argues that genetic enhancement should be considered as a legitimate and morally permissible way to improve the quality of life for individuals, including parents and children.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.**"
