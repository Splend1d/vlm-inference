According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is considered morally wrong because it involves exposing oneself to the risk of injury or harm to others, especially if the beach is crowded or there are other people nearby. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) told her it was safe to jump off the couch. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a decision made by the individual, and it is not harmful to others or the environment."
