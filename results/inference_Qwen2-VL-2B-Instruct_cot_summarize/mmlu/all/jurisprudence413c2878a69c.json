Because the practice of punishment is separate from its justification.\n\nSeparating the concept of punishment from its justification is important because it allows for a more objective and neutral evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of punishment. This separation helps to ensure that the punishment is not influenced by personal biases or preconceived notions about what is just or unjust. It also allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles and values that guide the use of punishment."
