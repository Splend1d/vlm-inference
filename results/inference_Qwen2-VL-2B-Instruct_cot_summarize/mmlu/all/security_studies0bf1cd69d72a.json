Deterrence theory and game theory became highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because the nature of the object allowed for a high degree of normative theorization which was accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique.\nB. The progressive research programs produced theories that actually formed their own reality of abstractions, the world of, 'secure second strike capability', 'extended deterrence' and 'escalation dominance'.\nC. Game theory and deterrence theory as an intellectual development resulted in the trade-off between policy relevance/utility and theoretical abstraction/sophistication.\nD. None of the above. The influence of deterrence theory was illusory. The build-up of nuclear weapons and first strike orientated policy was driven by the internal logic of maximizing firepower. Theory served as the smokescreen that belied the intent.\n"

Theory served as the smokescreen that belied the intent.\n\nGame theory and deterrence theory were not central to the intellectual development of security studies during the 'golden age'. Instead, the focus was on the development of theories that could explain the behavior of states and the dynamics of international relations, such as the theory of international relations and the theory of international conflict. These theories were more focused on explaining the behavior of states and the dynamics of international relations, rather than on the development of theories that could explain the behavior of states and the dynamics of international relations."
