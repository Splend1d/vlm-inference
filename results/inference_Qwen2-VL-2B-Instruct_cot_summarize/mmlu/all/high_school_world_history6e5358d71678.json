Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\nInstructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512\nThe tone of the first letter best reflects which of the following developments in early modern Africa?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the tone of the first letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, we need to analyze the content and context of the letter. The letter discusses the inconvenience of European trade goods reaching Kongo and the potential for European exploitation of Kongo's people. It also mentions the king's desire to serve God and the king of Kongo, but also acknowledges the cost of the expedition and the need to fill the ships with goods.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods\n- This option suggests that Kongo is becoming more dependent on European trade for manufactured goods. The letter does mention the inconvenience of European trade goods reaching Kongo, which could be interpreted as a growing dependence on European trade.\n\nB. Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest\n- This option suggests that Kongo is resisting European expeditions of conquest. The letter does mention the king's desire to serve God and the king of Kongo, which could be interpreted as a resistance to European conquest.\n\nC. The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline\n- This option suggests that Kongo is establishing Portuguese trading posts along the coastline. The letter does not mention the establishment of Portuguese trading posts, so this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\nD. The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa\n- This option suggests that Kongo is consolidating states along the Atlantic coast of Africa. The letter does not mention the consolidation of states, so this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\nGiven the analysis, the tone of the first letter best reflects:\n\nA. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods"
