During the course of their conversation, the woman told the man that she was just laid off her job and desperately needed money to pay her rent. The man, a practical joker, pointed to a nearby coat rack and said, \"Hey, see that fur coat there. Why don't you take it?\" The man then told the woman that he would cause a disturbance to distract attention while she ran out of the bar with the coat. Believing that it was a good idea, the woman agreed to take part in the scheme. Thereupon, the man lit a matchbook and threw it on top of the bar. He then yelled, \"The bar's on fire, help!\" When everyone turned to look at the man, the woman ran to the back of the bar, took the fur coat and scurried outside unnoticed. Just as the woman left the bar and was running down the sidewalk, she was apprehended and arrested by a police officer. Later, the man confessed that the fur coat that the woman took really belonged to him. With respect to the man's and the woman's criminal liability, which of the following is most correct?\n\nA. The man and the woman are guilty of conspiracy and larceny.\nB. The man and the woman are guilty of larceny.\nC. The woman is guilty of larceny.\nD. The man and the woman are not guilty of either conspiracy or larceny.\n"

The woman is guilty of larceny.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Larceny**: Larceny involves the taking of someone else's property without their consent. In this scenario, the woman took the fur coat from the man without his consent, which is larceny.\n\n2. **Conspiracy**: Conspiracy involves the planning of an unlawful act. The man's actions were not planned, but rather a spontaneous and impulsive decision to cause a disturbance. This does not constitute a conspiracy.\n\n3. **Collusion**: Collusion involves the agreement of two or more persons to commit a crime. There was no agreement between the man and the woman to commit the crime of larceny.\n\nTherefore, the woman is guilty of larceny, and the man is not guilty of either conspiracy or larceny."
