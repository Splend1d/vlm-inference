                    "text": "A state highway runs through the center of a city's business district. As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional. In all likelihood, will the plaintiff be successful in this cause of action?\n\nA. No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.\nB. No, because the city's action was reasonable.\nC. Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decisionmaking processes by means of coin flips.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand involves the constitutionality of a city's decision to prohibit parking on one side of a street in a business district, which led to the lounge being permanently prohibited from parking. The plaintiff, the lounge owner, is seeking declarative relief against the city, alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.**\n   - This option suggests that the city is immune from lawsuits. However, the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to suits brought by individuals against governmental entities. The city is not a governmental entity, and thus, it does not enjoy immunity from suits.\n\nB. **No, because the city's action was reasonable.**\n   - This option suggests that the city's decision was reasonable. However, the city's decision to ban parking on one side of the street was based on state highway regulations, which are not necessarily reasonable or constitutional. The city's action was not based on any reasonable or constitutional grounds.\n\nC. **Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n   - This option suggests that the city's action violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to suits brought by individuals against governmental entities. The city is not a governmental entity, and thus, it does not fall under the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nD. **Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decisionmaking processes by means of coin flips.**\n   - This option suggests that the city's decision was made by means of a coin flip, which is not a responsible decision-making process. However, the city's decision was based on state highway regulations, which are not necessarily responsible or constitutional.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the city's action was reasonable.**\n\nThe city's decision to ban parking on one side of the street was based on state highway regulations, which are not necessarily reasonable or constitutional."
