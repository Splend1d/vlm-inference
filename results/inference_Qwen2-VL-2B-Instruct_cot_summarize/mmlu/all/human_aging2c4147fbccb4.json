Many theories will have to be combined to explain senescence\n\nSenescence is a complex biological process that involves aging and the accumulation of damage to cells and tissues. While there are several theories about how senescence occurs, none of them have been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, it is likely that many different theories will have to be combined to explain the full range of phenomena associated with senescence."
