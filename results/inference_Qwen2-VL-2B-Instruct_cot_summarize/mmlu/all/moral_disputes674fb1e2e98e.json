The impression of distinct ideas clear.\n\nOn Mill's view, the collision with error, which is the process of making an impression of something that is not true, makes the impression of distinct ideas clear. This is because the error in the impression leads to a more vivid and vividly distinct impression of the idea, making it easier to distinguish it from other ideas."
