In exchange for $1 received this day, I agree that you can have one month from today's date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The first student then signed the paper and handed it to the second student. The second student handed a one dollar bill to the first student and left. One week later, the second student succeeded in obtaining a $1,000 loan from his parents. He then telephoned the first student to accept the offer. Upon hearing the second student say hello, and before the second student could accept the offer, the first student said, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car. \"Can the second student still accept the first student's offer?\n\nA. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\nB. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\nC. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\nD. Yes, based on the principal of promissory estoppel.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the second student can still accept the first student's offer, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the legal implications involved.\n\n1. **Initial Offer and Acceptance:**\n   - The first student initially offered to sell his car for $1,000.\n   - The second student accepted the offer, agreeing to buy the car for $1 received this day.\n   - The first student then signed a document confirming the offer and the terms.\n\n2. **One Week Later:**\n   - The second student obtained a $1,000 loan from his parents.\n   - He then telephoned the first student to accept the offer.\n\n3. **First Student's Change of Mind:**\n   - The first student changed his mind and said, \"I do not want to sell my car.\"\n\n### Analysis of Each Option:\n\n**A. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.**\n   - The first student initially offered $1,000, which is a substantial amount. The second student accepted the offer for $1, which is a very small amount. This is not an adequate consideration for the first student to change his mind.\n\n**B. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.**\n   - The first student's statement was clear and unequivocal. He changed his mind after the second student accepted the offer, which is a clear indication that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\n\n**C. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.**\n   - The first student's letter was a written offer, which is a valid option for the second student to accept or reject. The second student accepted the offer, so the offer was valid.\n\n**D. Yes, based on the principal of promissory estoppel.**\n   - Promissory estoppel is a legal doctrine that allows a party to change their mind after a promise has been made. However, the first student's change of mind occurred after the second student accepted the offer, which is not a typical scenario where promissory estoppel applies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe second student can still accept the first student's offer because the first student's change of mind occurred after the second student accepted the offer, which is not a typical scenario where promissory estoppel applies. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.**"
