(ii) and (iv) only.\n\nVariance decomposition analysis of VARs measures the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR, and it can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable. However, the ordering of the variables is not important for calculating impulse responses but is important for variance decompositions."
