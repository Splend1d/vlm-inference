The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.\nB. This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.\nC. This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.\nD. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n"

This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\nA stratified sample involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (strata) based on a characteristic of interest, and then randomly selecting a sample from each stratum. This method allows for more precise comparisons between groups within the population, which can be particularly useful in research where the relationship between variables is expected to vary across different subgroups."
