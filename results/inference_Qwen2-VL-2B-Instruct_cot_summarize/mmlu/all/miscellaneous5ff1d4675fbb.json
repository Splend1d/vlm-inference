                    "text": "To determine the correct conclusion, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**: The MPC increased from 0.75 in year 1 to 0.80 in year 2. This means that for every $1 increase in disposable income, consumers spend an additional $0.15 in year 2 compared to year 1.\n\n2. **Multiplier Effect**: The spending multiplier is calculated as the ratio of the change in government spending to the change in disposable income. It is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{\\text{Change in government spending}}{\\text{Change in disposable income}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Effect of MPC on the Spending Multiplier**: The MPC affects the multiplier effect by changing the relationship between government spending and disposable income. A higher MPC means that a given change in government spending leads to a larger increase in disposable income.\n\nGiven that the MPC increased from 0.75 to 0.80, we can infer that the multiplier effect increased as well. This is because a higher MPC implies that a given increase in government spending leads to a larger increase in disposable income, which in turn leads to a larger increase in real output.\n\n4. **Effect of MPC on the Effectiveness of Government Spending**: A higher MPC means that a given increase in government spending leads to a larger increase in disposable income, which in turn leads to a larger increase in real output. This implies that a given change in government spending would have had a more powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, the correct conclusion is:\n\nC. A given change in government spending would have had a more powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
