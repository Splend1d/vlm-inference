An increase in aggregate demand.\n\nThis is because a decrease in the unemployment rate typically indicates an increase in aggregate demand, as it suggests that there are more people looking for jobs, which can lead to increased spending and economic growth. Similarly, a decrease in the inflation rate suggests that the economy is operating closer to its natural rate of inflation, which can also be attributed to an increase in aggregate demand."
