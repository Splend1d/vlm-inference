Judgment should be for\n\nA. the buyer, because the covenants contained inthe deed run with the land.\nB. the farmer, because no privity of estate existsbetween the buyer and the farmer.\nC. the buyer, but only for the covenants of seisinand right to convey.\nD. the farmer, because the covenants are personalin nature and do not run with the land.\n"

However, the buyer is later evicted by a woman because of paramount title. The buyer now brings suit against the farmer for breach of covenants in the deed. The question asks which party should be held liable for the breach of the covenants.\n\nThe key point here is that the covenants in the deed are personal in nature and do not run with the land. This means that the covenants are not enforceable against the farmer or the landscaper, but rather against the buyer who conveyed the property to the buyer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the farmer, because the covenants are personal in nature and do not run with the land."
