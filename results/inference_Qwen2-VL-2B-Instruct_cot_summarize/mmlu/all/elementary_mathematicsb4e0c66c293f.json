When a number is rounded to the nearest thousand, it means that the last digit in the number is dropped and the number is rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\nGiven that the rounded number is 47,000, we need to find the original number that, when rounded to the nearest thousand, would result in 47,000.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. 46,295: The last digit is 5, which is less than 5, so this number would not round to 47,000.\n\nB. 46,504: The last digit is 4, which is greater than 5, so this number would round to 47,000.\n\nC. 47,520: The last digit is 0, which is less than 5, so this number would not round to 47,000.\n\nD. 47,924: The last digit is 4, which is greater than 5, so this number would round to 47,000.\n\nTherefore, the number that could be the original number that was rounded to the nearest thousand is B. 46,504."
