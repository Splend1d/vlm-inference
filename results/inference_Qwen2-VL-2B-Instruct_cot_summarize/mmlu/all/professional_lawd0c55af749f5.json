In July 1990, the investor acquired title to a 100-acre tract located just outside the city limits in a rural area. In 1997, the investor decided to sell his vast ranching and oil interests in the Rocky Mountains. In July, the investor conveyed the tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 100-acre tract, the nephew discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the chef of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the chef learned that the nephew was selling oil from the drilling operations. The chef has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal. If the nephew's wife died without issue before the beginning of the nephew's oil drilling operations, would this improve the likelihood of the chef's success than if the wife were still alive?\n\nA. No, because the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\nB. No, because the nature of the nephew's estate would not be altered by the wife's death.\nC. Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\nD. Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n"

Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\n\nWhen a wife dies without issue, her estate is divided among her children. If the wife had no children, her estate would be divided among her surviving spouse and her children. In this case, the chef would inherit the oil reserves from the nephew's estate, which would be a reversionary interest. This means that the chef would have a right to the oil reserves for the remainder of his life, but the right to remove oil would be terminated upon his death. Therefore, the chef would have a reversionary interest in the oil reserves, which would improve the likelihood of his success in an accounting of the value of the oil removed and an injunction against further oil removal."
