It seems to be true for homosexuals but not for heterosexuals.\n\nThe folk saying \"opposites attract\" is often associated with the idea that people with different characteristics or orientations tend to like each other. However, research has shown that this is not always the case. For example, research has found that people who are attracted to people of the same gender are more likely to be attracted to people of the same gender, and people who are attracted to people of the opposite gender are more likely to be attracted to people of the opposite gender. This suggests that the idea of \"opposites attracting\" may not always hold true for all people."
