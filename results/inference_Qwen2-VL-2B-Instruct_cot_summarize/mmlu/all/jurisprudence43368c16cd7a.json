Wade, which established the constitutional right to privacy in the United States, was highly controversial because it was seen as a significant expansion of a woman's right to privacy. The court ruled that the Texas abortion law violated a woman's right to privacy, which was a significant legal precedent that had implications for the abortion rights of women across the country."
