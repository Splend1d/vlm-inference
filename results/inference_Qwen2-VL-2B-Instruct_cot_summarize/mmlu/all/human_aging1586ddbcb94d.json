It is a common cause of death in older adults and can occur at any age, but it is more common in older adults. Cohort effects refer to differences in health outcomes that are due to the timing of exposure to a particular risk factor or exposure to a particular health risk. In the case of dementia, the timing of exposure to risk factors such as age, genetics, and environmental factors can affect the likelihood of developing the condition. Therefore, differences in dementia rates between different age groups could be a cohort effect."
