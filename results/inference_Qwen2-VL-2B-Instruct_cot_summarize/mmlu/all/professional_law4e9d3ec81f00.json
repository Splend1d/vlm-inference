This clause guarantees that laws shall not be applied in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious, and it protects against the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n\nWhile the other options provide some context, they do not directly address the constitutional protection provided by the due process clause. The enforcement provision of Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude, is more relevant to the issue of racial discrimination in the sale, transfer, and rental of real estate, but it does not directly relate to the due process clause. The enforcement provision of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the denial or abridgment of the right to vote, is also relevant but does not directly address the issue of racial discrimination in real estate transactions."
