The store clerk refused to sell it to him, because it was a \"house rule\" that the necklace was intended for women only. If the man brings suit against the store for its refusal to sell him the necklace, the man will\n\nA. lose, because the advertisement was intended only as an invitation to make an offer.\nB. lose, because the man did not notii' the store in writing that he intended to accept the offer.\nC. win, because the advertisement should be construed as a binding offer.\nD. win, because it is immaterial whether the man was the first customer to appear at the store to purchase the necklace.\n"

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The advertisement is an invitation to make an offer, not an offer itself.\n2. The advertisement specifies that the necklace is intended for women only.\n3. The man is the first customer to arrive at the store, but the advertisement does not explicitly state that he is the first customer to make an offer.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nA. lose, because the advertisement was intended only as an invitation to make an offer.\n\nThe advertisement is an invitation to make an offer, not an offer itself. The man's arrival does not change the fact that the advertisement was intended as an invitation. Therefore, the man cannot claim that he was the first customer to make an offer, and thus cannot sue for refusal to sell the necklace."
