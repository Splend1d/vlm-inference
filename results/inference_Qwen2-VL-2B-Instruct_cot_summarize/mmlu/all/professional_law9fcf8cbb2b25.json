At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: \"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. \"Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\nB. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\nC. The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\nD. Neither party recovers anything from the other.\n"

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The amount of damages awarded to each party.\n2. The proportion of fault attributed to each party.\n3. The statute that governs the reduction of damages due to contributory negligence.\n\nGiven the information:\n- The truck driver's injuries were $10,000.\n- The car driver's injuries were $8,000.\n- The jury found each driver liable for negligence.\n- The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault to the truck driver and 50 percent to the car driver.\n\nThe statute states that contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. This means that any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery.\n\nLet's calculate the appropriate judgment:\n\n1. **Amount of damages awarded to each party:**\n   - Truck driver's damages: $10,000\n   - Car driver's damages: $8,000\n\n2. **Proportion of fault attributed to each party:**\n   - Truck driver's fault: 50%\n   - Car driver's fault: 50%\n\n3. **Determine the reduction in damages due to contributory negligence:**\n   - Total fault: 50% + 50% = 100%\n   - Amount of damages attributable to the truck driver: 50% of $10,000 = $5,000\n   - Amount of damages attributable to the car driver: 50% of $8,000 = $4,000\n\n4. **Calculate the final judgment:**\n   - Total damages: $10,000 (truck driver) + $8,000 (car driver) = $18,000\n   - Reduction due to contributory negligence: $5,000 (truck driver) + $4,000 (car driver) = $9,000\n   - Final judgment: $18,000 - $9,000 = $9,000\n\nTherefore, the appropriate judgment is:\n\n**B. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.**\n\nFinal answer: B"
