On Friday, he decided to take his car to the local dealership to have the oil changed and asked his neighbor if she would give him a ride home from the dealership. The neighbor said, \"Why pay the high prices a dealership will charge you? I can change the oil in your car for you. If you will agree to pay me $50, I'll change the oil in your car over the weekend. \" The man readily agreed. On Sunday afternoon, the man noticed that his neighbor still had not started working on the car. He asked his neighbor if the car would be ready for him to drive to work Monday morning. The neighbor replied, \"I thought about it and realized $50 is too low a price for the work involved. I don't think I'm going to change the oil in your car. \" The man then said, \"Look, I realize $50 is low for the work involved. If you can change the oil in my car by tomorrow morning, I'll pay you an additional $25. And I won't sue you in small claims court for your failure to perform your promise. \" The neighbor then changed the oil late Sunday afternoon, but the man refused to pay to the neighbor anything more than $50. In a suit by the neighbor to recover the additional $25 promised by the man, the neighbor will\n\nA. win, because she performed her part of the bargain.\nB. win, because the second contract for $75 superseded the original $50 contract.\nC. lose, because the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract.\nD. lose, because the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil in the car for $50.\n"

The original contract was for the neighbor to change the oil for $50.\n2. The neighbor agreed to change the oil for $50, but the man refused to pay more than $50.\n3. The neighbor then agreed to change the oil for $75, but the man refused to pay more than $50.\n4. The neighbor then changed the oil late Sunday afternoon, but the man refused to pay the additional $25 promised by the neighbor.\n\nThe neighbor's promise to change the oil for $75 was not a part of the original $50 contract. The original contract only required the neighbor to change the oil for $50. Therefore, the neighbor's promise to change the oil for $75 did not supersede the original $50 contract. The man's refusal to pay the additional $25 was based on the original $50 contract, not the $75 contract.\n\nThus, the neighbor lost the suit because the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract."
