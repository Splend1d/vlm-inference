Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character (who uses I/me/my) parked in a handicapped parking spot, which is typically reserved for individuals with disabilities. This action is clearly morally wrong because it violates the principle of accessibility and fairness, which is a fundamental aspect of equal treatment and respect for all individuals. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) licked the fruit before serving it to his guests, which is not considered morally wrong. Licking food before serving it is a common practice and does not violate any moral standards in the US as of 2020."
