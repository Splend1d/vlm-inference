State law, however, prohibits use of this state funding for surgery for any person who has resided in the state for less than one year, except in emergency situations. A woman moved to the state two months ago seeking permanent employment. Her physician recommends non-emergency surgery to treat a medical condition. The surgery would qualify for state funding if the woman had resided in the state for a year. The woman has sued to invalidate the state law that prohibits state funding of her surgery. Should the woman prevail in her action?\n\nA. No, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources.\nB. No, because the law reasonably prevents the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents.\nC. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care.\nD. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n"

The woman in question moved to the state two months ago and has been seeking permanent employment. Her physician recommends non-emergency surgery to treat a medical condition.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. No, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources.\n- This option suggests that the law is reasonable because it conserves the state's limited resources. However, the law in question is not conserving resources but rather preventing the expenditure of state funds on non-emergency surgery for residents who have resided in the state for less than one year. This is a different form of resource allocation.\n\nB. No, because the law reasonably prevents the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents.\n- This option implies that the law is reasonable because it prevents the expenditure of state funds on non-residents who have moved in for a short period. However, the law in question is not preventing the expenditure of state funds on non-residents but rather on residents who have moved in for a short period.\n\nC. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care.\n- This option suggests that the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care. However, the law in question is not burdening the woman's right to health care but rather preventing the expenditure of state funds on non-emergency surgery for residents who have resided in the state for less than one year.\n\nD. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n- This option suggests that the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel. However, the law in question is not burdening the woman's right to travel but rather preventing the expenditure of state funds on non-emergency surgery for residents who have resided in the state for less than one year.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. No, because the law reasonably prevents the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
