Two days after the robbeiy, one of the men was involved in an auto accident. The man was rushed to the hospital and taken to the x-ray room. A doctor positioned the man so that the x-ray technician would be able to take x-rays of his lower back area. Based on the man's complaints about the area of pain, the doctor stated, \"It seems as if you might have a fractured pelvis. If you do, you'll have to stay in bed for several weeks. \" The man responded that he couldn't do that because he had to meet the other man tomorrow. A technician who was in the room at the time overheard the man's response to the doctor. Subsequently, both men are charged with robbery and conspiracy. At the man's trial, as evidence of a conspiracy, the prosecution attempts to introduce the doctor's testimony that the man said, \"I have to meet the other man tomorrow. \" The defense objects. This evidence is\n\nA. inadmissible, because it violates the physician- patient privilege.\nB. admissible, because the technician overheard the conversation.\nC. admissible, because of the nature of the man's statements.\nD. admissible, because the statement was not confidential, under the circumstances.\n"

The doctor's testimony is not privileged because the man was not in a position to refuse to be interviewed by the doctor, and the doctor's testimony is not protected by the physician-patient privilege. Therefore, the testimony can be used as evidence in the trial."
