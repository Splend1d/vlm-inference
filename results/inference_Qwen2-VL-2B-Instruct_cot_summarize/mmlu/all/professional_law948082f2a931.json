After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work. When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.\nB. admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.\nC. inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nD. inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n"

Inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nThe Dead Man's Statute is a legal doctrine that prevents the introduction of evidence of a statement made by a deceased person in a proceeding that is not otherwise admissible. In this case, the gardener's proposed testimony to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend would be inadmissible because it would be an attempt to introduce evidence of a statement made by a deceased person (the friend) that is not otherwise admissible. Therefore, the proposed testimony would be inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute."
