In this context, the decision is whether to close the park based on the lead levels in the soil samples.\n\n- **Type I Error (A):** Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit. This would be incorrect because the lead levels are not high enough to warrant closure.\n  \n- **Type I Error (B):** Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit. This would be incorrect because the lead levels are high enough to warrant closure.\n\n- **Type I Error (C):** Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit. This would be incorrect because the lead levels are not high enough to warrant closure.\n\n- **Type I Error (D):** Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit. This would be incorrect because the lead levels are not high enough to warrant closure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit**."
