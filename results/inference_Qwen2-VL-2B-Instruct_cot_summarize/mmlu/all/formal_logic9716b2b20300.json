(B \u2283 ~E) means \"If B is true, then E is false.\"\n\nNow, let's translate each part into English sentences:\n\nA. It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\n- This is a direct translation of the formula. It means that the condition \"Marina reads a Percy Jackson book\" does not imply \"Izzy plays Minecraft,\" but \"Izzy plays Minecraft\" does imply \"Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\"\n\nB. If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft, which entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\n- This is also a direct translation of the formula. It means that if Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft, and this entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\n\nC. Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\n- This is a direct translation of the formula.

It's not true that Marina reads a Percy Jackson book only when Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft only when Ashleigh stops by.\n- This is a direct translation of the formula. It means that it is not true that Marina reads a Percy Jackson book only when Izzy plays Minecraft, and it is also not true that Izzy plays Minecraft only when Ashleigh stops by.\n\nSo, the natural English sentences translated from the given PL formula are:\n\nA. It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\nB. If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft, which entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\nC. Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.\nD.
