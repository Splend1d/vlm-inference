Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $500 or more than $5,000 The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. The defendant, a recovering alcoholic, worked as a cashier at a drug store. Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them. Seeing the defendant lying on the floor, unconscious, the girl left the exact price for the cigarettes on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because the offense does not require any mental state.\nB. guilty, because the defendant's intoxication was voluntaiy.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant was unconscious.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant's employer is vicariously liable for the violation that occurred.\n"

The statute prohibits the sale of cigarettes to anyone under the age of 17, regardless of the defendant's mental state.\n2. The defendant's intoxication was voluntary, as he voluntarily consumed the rum.\n3. The defendant was unconscious when he committed the offense, which is a legal defense in criminal law.\n4. The defendant's employer, the drug store, is vicariously liable for the violation that occurred, as the store is responsible for the actions of its employees.\n\nTherefore, the defendant should be found guilty because the offense does not require any mental state."
