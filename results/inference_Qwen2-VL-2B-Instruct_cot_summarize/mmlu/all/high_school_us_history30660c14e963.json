There they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization. . . .\n\"This emigration would be voluntary, for it would be as cruel and unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. . . .\"\n\u2014President Andrew Jackson, 1829\nBased on this quotation, what can you infer about the efforts of Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement of the 1950s?\n\nA. The civil rights movement was not finding success through nonviolent methods.\nB. Advocates for civil rights were coordinating their efforts to raise awareness of racial segregation across the country.\nC. King was focused on ending segregation in Birmingham only.\nD.

The quote discusses President Andrew Jackson's proposal for a reservation for Indian tribes, emphasizing the importance of giving them a safe haven and allowing them to govern themselves without interference from the United States government. This suggests a focus on self-governance and self-determination.\n\n2. The quote also mentions President Andrew Jackson's statement that the tribes would be subject to laws only to preserve peace on the frontier and between tribes. This implies that the tribes would be subject to laws that would protect their rights and interests.\n\n3. The quote concludes with President Andrew Jackson's statement that the tribes would be voluntary emigrants, emphasizing the idea of voluntary migration and the importance of their consent.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer the following:\n\n- The civil rights movement of the 1950s was not primarily focused on nonviolent methods. The quote suggests that the movement was more about advocating for self-governance and voluntary migration, which were not typically associated with nonviolent tactics.\n\n- Advocates for civil rights were indeed coordinating their efforts to raise awareness of racial segregation across the country. The quote implies that they were working to educate and inform the public about the issue, which was a key component of the civil rights movement.\n\n- Martin Luther King and others were not focused on ending segregation in Birmingham only. The quote does not provide information about King's specific focus on Birmingham, so we cannot infer that he was solely focused on Birmingham.\n\n- King was willing to compromise his principles and would be a violent agitator if necessary. The quote does not provide any information about King's willingness to compromise or his violent tactics.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate inference is:\n\nB. Advocates for civil rights were coordinating their efforts to raise awareness of racial segregation across the country."
