P = MR = MC > ATC\n\nIn the long run, a monopoly firm will likely experience a profit-maximizing output level, where price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR), marginal cost (MC), and average total cost (ATC). This is because a monopoly firm has the ability to set its own price and can charge a price above marginal cost and below average total cost, which allows it to earn a profit."
