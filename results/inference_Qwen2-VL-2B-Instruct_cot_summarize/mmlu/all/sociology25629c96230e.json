Glass ceiling\n\nThe phenomenon that is most likely to explain Giselle's lack of promotion is the \"glass ceiling,\" which refers to the belief that women and other underrepresented groups face barriers to advancement in the workplace, particularly in traditionally male-dominated fields. This belief can lead to a perception that women are not as qualified or capable as their male counterparts, leading to their underemployment or lack of promotion."
