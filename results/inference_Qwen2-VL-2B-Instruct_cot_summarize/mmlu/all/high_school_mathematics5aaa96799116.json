Here, $a = 32$, $b = -8$, $c = 5$, and $d = 3$. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n\\[\n(32 + 5i)(5 - 3i) = 32 \\cdot 5 - 3 \\cdot 5 + 32 \\cdot 3 + (-8) \\cdot 5 = 160 - 15 + 96 - 40 = 167\n\\]\n\nSo, the product of the two complex numbers is $167$, which is not equal to $32 - 8i$. Therefore, the product of the two complex numbers is not equal to $32 - 8i$. This means that the product of the two complex numbers is not equal to $32 - 8i$, and thus, Ramanujan did not pick $32 - 8i$. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 32-8i"
