This is a classic example of a genetic trait being passed down through generations, where the new trait is not inherited from the parents but is instead produced by the offspring.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Fallow deer**: Fallow deer do not have a distinct phenotype that can be bred with another deer to produce offspring with the new phenotype. They are a single species and do not exhibit traits that can be bred.\n\nB. **Fruit flies**: Fruit flies are a well-known example of a species where traits can be bred. If a fruit fly with a new phenotype is produced, it can be bred with other fruit flies to produce offspring with the new phenotype.\n\nC. **Grass**: Grass is a plant species, and traits such as height, color, and texture are not typically bred in the same way as in animals. Traits in grass are more likely to be inherited from parents and not produced by offspring.\n\nD. **Spotted toads**: Spotted toads are a species where the spotted phenotype is not inherited from parents but is produced by the offspring. This is a classic example of a trait being produced by the offspring.\n\nGiven the description, the process described is most likely to exhibit the process described earlier in **D. Spotted toads**.\n\nFinal answer: D. Spotted toads"
