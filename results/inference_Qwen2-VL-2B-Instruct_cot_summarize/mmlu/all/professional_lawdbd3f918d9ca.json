The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\n\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\n"

Let's analyze each option in detail:\n\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\n- This option suggests that the owner had a duty to warn the trespassers, even if they were aware of the danger. This is a reasonable interpretation, as the owner had knowledge of the danger and was aware of the trespassers' presence.\n\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\n- This option implies that the owner is strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the owner is strictly liable for any injuries. The focus is on the duty to warn, not liability for injuries.\n\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\n- This option suggests that the owner owes no duty to trespassers unless they act with willful or wanton disregard. The passage does not provide any indication that the owner acted with willful or wanton disregard, so this option is not supported by the information given.\n\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\n- This option suggests that the owner has no duty to protect the safety of trespassers. However, the passage does not provide any information about the owner's duty to protect the safety of trespassers. The focus is on the duty to warn, not the duty to protect.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\n\nFinal answer: A."
