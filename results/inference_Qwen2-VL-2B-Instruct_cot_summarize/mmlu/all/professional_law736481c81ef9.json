                    "text": "To determine whether the newcomer can make a successful equal protection argument to fight for her job, let's analyze the context and the options provided.\n\n1. **Context Analysis**: The newcomer is a new employee in a small town, and the city manual requires that new employees pay a higher contribution to the employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. The newcomer refuses to pay the higher contribution, leading to her termination.\n\n2. **Equal Protection Argument**: An equal protection argument typically involves a claim that a law or policy is discriminatory based on a protected characteristic. In this case, the newcomer is a new employee, and the city's policy requires higher contributions from new employees.\n\n3. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **Option A**: \"No, she is not a member of a suspect class as there cannot be a 'class-of-one' in the employment law context.\"\n     - This option suggests that the newcomer cannot be considered a suspect class because there is no \"class-of-one\" in employment law. However, the newcomer is a new employee, and the city's policy is based on the number of years of employment, not the specific individual. This does not necessarily mean she cannot be considered a suspect class.\n   - **Option B**: \"No, the request for the contribution was not unreasonable and cannot support an equal protection argument.\"\n     - This option suggests that the newcomer's refusal to pay the higher contribution was not unreasonable. However, the city's policy is based on the number of years of employment, not the individual's reason for not paying the higher contribution. This does not necessarily mean the policy is unreasonable.\n   - **Option C**: \"Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\"\n     - This option suggests that the newcomer can claim membership in a class of one who is being discriminated against. However, the newcomer is not a member of a suspect class, and the city's policy is based on the number of years of employment, not the individual.\n   - **Option D**: \"Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\"\n     - This option suggests that the newcomer can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time. This is a valid argument, as the newcomer is a new employee in a small town, and the city's policy requires higher contributions from new employees.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.**"
