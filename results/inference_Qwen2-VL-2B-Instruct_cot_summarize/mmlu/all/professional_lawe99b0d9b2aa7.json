A divisible contract.\n\nA divisible contract is one where the parties agree to divide the contract into separate parts, each of which is subject to separate terms and conditions. In this case, the employee and the employer agreed to divide the contract into two parts: the first six months and the remaining six months. This means that the employee has the right to receive the first six months of salary, and the employer has the right to receive the remaining six months of salary. The agreement between the employer and the employee is divisible, and the employee has the right to receive the first six months of salary and the employer has the right to receive the remaining six months of salary."
