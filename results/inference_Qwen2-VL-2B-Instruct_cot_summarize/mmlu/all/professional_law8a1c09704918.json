In its case-in-chief, the government wants to introduce a copy of the defendant's transcript from a technical college to show his certificate as gunsmith. The college is no longer in existence, though, and the whereabouts of the previous officials and employees are unknown. However, the transcript bears a seal above the registrar's signature, and the court has taken judicial notice of the existence of the college and has found that it is normal for a college to compile a transcript. Finally, the information about the defendant on the transcript has been corroborated by a government witness. Assume the prosecution provided the defendants with a copy of the transcript before trial and informed them of its intent to introduce it as evidence. The transcript will be admitted\n\nA. as a business record, because the custodian can testifS' as to how the records of the college were kept.\nB. under the general hearsay exception, as the transcript in these circumstances has sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\nC. only if the registrar's signature can be authenticated by an expert witness.\nD. only if the defendant waives his right to object to its admission.\n"

It is a business record, which means it is created and maintained by a business or organization, and it is relevant to the case.\n\n2. **Trustworthiness**: The transcript bears a seal above the registrar's signature, which is a common practice in business documents to indicate authenticity and reliability. The court has taken judicial notice of the existence of the college, which means it is considered to be a normal and accepted practice in the field of education.\n\n3. **Circumstantial Guarantees of Trustworthiness**: The transcript has been corroborated by a government witness, which is a strong indication of its reliability and authenticity. The witness's testimony is considered to be reliable because it is based on the transcript and the defendant's admission that it was provided to him before trial.\n\n4. **Admissibility**: Given these circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, the transcript can be admitted under the general hearsay exception, which allows the court to rely on the testimony of a witness who has seen the document and is familiar with its contents.\n\nTherefore, the transcript can be admitted under the general hearsay exception, as it has sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness."
