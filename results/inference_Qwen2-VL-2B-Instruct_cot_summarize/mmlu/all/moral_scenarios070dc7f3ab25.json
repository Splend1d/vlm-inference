This is because it is considered rude and disrespectful to cut off a conversation abruptly, especially when it involves a parent. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) stole the spotlight at the talent show. This is considered morally wrong because it involves stealing someone else's opportunity and attention, which is generally considered unfair and dishonest."
