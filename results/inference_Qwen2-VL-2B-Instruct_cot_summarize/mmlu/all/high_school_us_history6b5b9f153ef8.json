The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

                    "text": "To determine the political position that Calhoun's language in his \"Exposition and Protest\" most closely resembles, let's analyze the context and the language used by Calhoun.\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: Calhoun's \"Exposition and Protest\" discusses the division of powers between the General and State Governments, particularly in the context of the sovereignty of the states. He argues that the division of powers is necessary for the proper functioning of the government and that the states have the right to correct any infractions of their powers.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **A. The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824**: This option refers to Andrew Jackson's response to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824, which was a political maneuver by the Federalists to gain control of the presidency. This is not related to the division of powers or the sovereignty of the states.\n   - **B. The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812**: This option refers to the response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812, which was a conflict between the United States and Great Britain. This is also not related to the division of powers or the sovereignty of the states.\n   - **C. The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates\":** This option refers to the response of the Jefferson administration to the Barbary pirates, which were a series of pirate attacks on American ships in the Mediterranean. This is not related to the division of powers or the sovereignty of the states.\n   - **D. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s**: This option refers to Daniel Shays' response to the fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s, which were related to the state's debt and taxes. This is not related to the division of powers or the sovereignty of the states.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The language used by Calhoun in his \"Exposition and Protest\" is most closely aligned with the response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\" This is because both scenarios involve the division of powers and the sovereignty of the states, with the Jefferson administration dealing with the Barbary pirates and the states dealing with their powers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\"**"
