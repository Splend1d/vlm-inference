This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves using another person's property without their consent and without their knowledge, which can be seen as a form of theft or exploitation. In Scenario 2, the main character kept the fireplace lit while the chimney cleaner was in it. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a necessary action to ensure the chimney cleaner's safety and prevent any potential hazards."
