The table gives us the cumulative probability up to that z-score. The probability of a z-score being less than 1.5 is approximately 0.9358. Therefore, the probability of a z-score being greater than 1.5 is 1 - 0.9358 = 0.0642.\n\nTo find the percentage of candy bars that contain more than 225 calories, we multiply this probability by 100% (or 1):\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = 0.0642 \\times 100\\% = 6.42\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the percentage is approximately 6.42%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 6.42%"
