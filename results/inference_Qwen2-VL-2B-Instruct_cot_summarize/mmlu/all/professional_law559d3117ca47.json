The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n"

The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The proposal involves a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock.\n- The proposal requires a two-thirds vote of each class of stock (voting common and nonvoting preferred).\n- The voting common stockholders approved the proposal with 700 votes in favor out of 1,000 votes.\n- The nonvoting preferred stockholders approved the proposal with 400 votes in favor out of 1,000 votes.\n\nSince the proposal requires a two-thirds vote of each class of stock, and only the voting common stockholders approved the proposal, the proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve."
