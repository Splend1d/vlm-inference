The elevator went all the way to the ground floor, but then just stopped there. The doors did not open. The lawyer tried pushing each of the buttons in the elevator and tried to use the intercom in the elevator to call for help, but nothing on the elevator's control panel seemed to be functioning. The lawyer was afraid that she would be stuck in the elevator all night. She began pounding on the doors and yelling. She started to feel panicked, hyperventilated, lost consciousness, and fell to the floor of the elevator. As she fell, she struck her head on the elevator wall, causing a large bump and bruise on her head. She was unconscious in the elevator for about 30 minutes before a security guard tried to use the elevator and realized it wasn't working. The guard managed to force the doors open and found the lawyer. At that moment, the lawyer regained consciousness. An investigation revealed that the elevator stopped working because it had not been properly maintained. The owner of the building had canceled all service and maintenance work on the elevator in order to save money. If the lawyer sues the building owner for false imprisonment, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because she was confined in the elevator for an unreasonably long period of time.\nB. prevail, because she was injured during her confinement in the elevator.\nC. not prevail, because the building owner did not intentionally cause the lawyer to be confined.\nD. not prevail, because the lawyer was unconscious and unaware of what was happening for most of the confinement period.\n"

The elevator stopped working because it had not been properly maintained, which is a common issue in many buildings. The lawyer's confinement was due to the failure of the elevator system, not the owner's negligence or intentional harm. Therefore, the lawyer cannot sue the building owner for false imprisonment."
