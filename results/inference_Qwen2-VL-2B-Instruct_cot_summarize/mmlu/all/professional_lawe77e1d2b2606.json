The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?\n\nA.

The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nThe statute of limitations is a legal principle that prevents a lawsuit from being brought against a person who has already committed a crime or committed a tort. In this case, the statute of limitations would prevent the creditor from suing the debtor for the $750 debt because the debt was barred by the statute of limitations on July 1. Therefore, the debtor's oral promise to pay the debt on September 1 would be unenforceable because the debt was already barred by the statute of limitations."
