The next door neighbor, Tony, shared a concrete driveway that ran between the two houses but was entirely on Mort's side of the property line. Tony had been using the driveway for the past 25 years, during which time three different owners bought and sold Mort's house. When Mort applied to refinance his loan, his appraiser found an old survey showing the accurate property boundaries. Upset, Mort filed a suit against Tony for trespass. What is the likely result?\n\nA. Mort will prevail in an action for trespass, because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\"\nB. Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious,\" since it was not widely known that he was on Mort's property.\nC. Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\nD. Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity.\n"

Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious,\" since it was not widely known that he was on Mort's property.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Property Line and Use**: The property line between Mort's and Tony's properties is clearly marked, and the concrete driveway runs entirely on Tony's side of the property line. This indicates that Tony has a legal right to use the driveway.\n\n2. **Use and Notoriety**: The key issue here is whether Tony's use of the driveway was \"open and notorious.\" In legal terms, an easement is typically created by continuous and open use, and it must be known to the public. If Tony's use was not open and notorious, it would not be considered an easement.\n\n3. **Statutory Period**: The statutory period for an easement is typically 20 years, but this does not necessarily mean that Tony's use must be open and notorious for the entire period. If Tony's use was known to Mort and others for a significant period, it could still be considered an easement.\n\n4. **Easement Due to Necessity**: If Tony's use was necessary for the property, it could still be considered an easement. However, the key point here is whether the use was open and notorious.\n\nGiven that Tony's use was not open and notorious, it is unlikely that Mort would prevail in an action for trespass. The court would likely find that Tony's use was not an easement and that Mort's property boundary was not invaded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
