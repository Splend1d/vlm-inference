The key factors to consider are the perpetrator's intent and the nature of the conduct.\n\n1. **Intent**: The perpetrator's intent is crucial. In this case, the perpetrator is described as a psychopathic personality who enjoys brutalizing innocent elderly people. His actions are described as heinous and shocking, indicating a clear intent to cause emotional distress.\n\n2. **Nature of Conduct**: The conduct in question is torture, which is a serious crime. The perpetrator's actions are described as outrageous and shocking, which is a key element of IIED.\n\n3. **Victim's Presence**: The victim was not present at the time of the torture, which is a relevant factor in determining whether the perpetrator's actions were intentional. However, this does not necessarily negate the perpetrator's intent or the nature of the conduct.\n\n4. **Immediate Family**: The victim's father is hospitalized and in intensive care, which suggests that the perpetrator's actions had a significant impact on the victim's family. This could be considered a factor in the perpetrator's intent and the nature of the conduct.\n\nGiven these points, the perpetrator's intent and the nature of the conduct are clear. The victim's presence and the impact on the family are also relevant. Therefore, the perpetrator's actions can be considered intentional, and the nature of the conduct is outrageous and shocking.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because in torture cases there is strict liability imposed on the perpetrator.**"
