Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\nB. Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.\nC. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\nD. Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.\n"

The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\n\nUranus and Neptune have a much slower rotation rate than Jupiter and Saturn, which means that the methane in their atmospheres has more time to migrate to higher altitudes and condense into clouds. This is because the slower rotation means that the methane molecules have more time to travel through the atmosphere before they cool and condense. This is why Uranus and Neptune have blue methane clouds, while Jupiter and Saturn do not."
