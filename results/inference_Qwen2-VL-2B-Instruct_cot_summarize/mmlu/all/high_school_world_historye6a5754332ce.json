And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\n\nA. They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.\nB. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\nC. As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.\nD. The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the likely cause of women not wearing the veil, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage discusses the behavior of women in a Muslim community, specifically regarding their clothing and behavior in the presence of men. It mentions that women do not veil themselves in the presence of men, and if they do, they are prevented by their families.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A: They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.**\n     - This option suggests that women were rebelling against oppressive conditions. However, the passage does not provide any indication that women were rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam. Instead, it describes their behavior in a specific cultural context.\n   - **Option B: It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.**\n     - This option implies that the practice of not veiling women was a continuation of a pre-existing cultural pattern. The passage does not provide any historical context or evidence to support this claim.\n   - **Option C: As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.**\n     - This option suggests that women were prevented from veiling themselves because they were seen as sexual objects. The passage does not provide any information about the women being seen as sexual objects.\n   - **Option D: The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.**\n     - This option suggests that the climate of Mali made veiling women impractical. The passage does not provide any information about the climate of Mali or its impact on women's clothing practices.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\nThe passage does not provide any evidence or context to support any of the given options. Therefore, the most plausible cause of women not wearing the veil is not explicitly stated in the passage. \n\n**Final Answer: The likely cause of women not wearing the veil is not explicitly stated in the passage.**"
