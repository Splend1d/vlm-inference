For example, if \\(a = 1\\) and \\(c = 2\\), then \\(a < c\\) is true, but \\(a < b\\) is false, and \\(a = c\\) is false, so the entire expression evaluates to false.\n\n2. **Option B: \\(a < b\\)**\n\n   This condition alone does not guarantee that \\(a < c \\lor a < b \\land \\neg(a = c)\\) evaluates to true. For example, if \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 2\\), then \\(a < b\\) is true, but \\(a < c\\) is false, and \\(a = c\\) is false, so the entire expression evaluates to false.\n\n3. **Option C: \\(a > b\\)**\n\n   This condition alone does not guarantee that \\(a < c \\lor a < b \\land \\neg(a = c)\\) evaluates to true. For example, if \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 2\\), then \\(a > b\\) is true, but \\(a < c\\) is false, and \\(a = c\\) is false, so the entire expression evaluates to false.\n\n4. **Option D: \\(a = b\\)**\n\n   This condition alone does not guarantee that \\(a < c \\lor a < b \\land \\neg(a = c)\\) evaluates to true. For example, if \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 2\\), then \\(a = b\\) is true, but \\(a < c\\) is false, and \\(a < b\\) is false, so the entire expression evaluates to false.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that none of the options alone guarantees that the expression evaluates to true.
