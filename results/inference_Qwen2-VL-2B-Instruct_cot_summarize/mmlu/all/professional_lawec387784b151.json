He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:\"Section 8. Any member of the state law enforcement staff. . . who is convicted of. . . briberyshall not be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the stateSuch conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contractSection 12. The provisions of this Act shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975. Section 14. This Act shall take effect immediately. \"Following the enactment of the statute, the state trooper received a letter from the state which stated that pursuant to the statute, the state is immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to you on account of your 2008 bribery conviction. \"The trooper contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. Assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. The trooper might still be able to eventually have his pension reinstated if\n\nA. he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U. S. Supreme Court.\nB. he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.\nC. he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of thestatute.\nD. he can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.\n"

                    "text": "The trooper's situation is a classic example of a case where the state's law enforcement officer has been convicted of a crime, and the state has taken action to discontinue his pension benefits. The trooper can potentially have his pension reinstated if he can show that the state's law violates his constitutional rights or if the state's law is unconstitutional.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. He exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n- This option is not relevant because the trooper has already served his sentence and is now facing the consequences of his conviction. The Constitution does not provide a mechanism for discretionary review of his pension benefits.\n\nB. He receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.\n- This option is not applicable because the trooper was convicted in federal court, not in a state court. The Constitution does not provide a mechanism for presidential pardons in federal cases.\n\nC. He can show that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute.\n- This option is relevant because the statute was enacted in 2009, and the trooper retired in 2006. If the trooper could show that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute, he might be able to have his pension reinstated.\n\nD. He can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.\n- This option is not relevant because the trooper's conviction occurred in federal court, and the dormant commerce clause does not apply to federal cases.\n\nGiven the analysis, the trooper can potentially have his pension reinstated if he can show that the state's law violates his constitutional rights or if the state's law is unconstitutional. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. He can show that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute."
