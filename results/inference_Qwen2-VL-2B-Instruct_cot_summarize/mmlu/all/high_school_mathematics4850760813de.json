The slope of a line given by this equation is $-\\frac{A}{B}$.\n\nThe slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the other line. So, if the slope of the first line is $m_1 = -\\frac{A}{B}$, the slope of the second line (which is perpendicular to it) is $m_2 = -\\frac{B}{A}$.\n\nGiven the first equation $x + 2y + 3 = 0$, we can rewrite it in the form $Ax + By + C = 0$ as $x + 2y = -3$. So, $A = 1$ and $B = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the slope of the second line, we get $m_2 = -\\frac{2}{1} = -2$.\n\nSetting $m_2 = -2$ equal to $m_1 = -\\frac{B}{A}$, we get $-\\frac{2}{1} = -\\frac{B}{A}$, which simplifies to $-2 = -\\frac{B}{1}$.\n\nSolving for $B$, we get $B = 2$.\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is 2. The answer is: $B$"
