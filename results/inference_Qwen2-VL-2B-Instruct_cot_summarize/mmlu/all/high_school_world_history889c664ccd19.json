Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nThe passage is most closely related with which of the following broad developments?\n\nA. Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens\nB. Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China\nC. Europe's economic domination of China\nD. Europe's colonization of Chinese territory\n"

It also mentions the export of beneficial products to foreign countries, which suggests a broader economic context.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens: This option is not directly related to the passage, which focuses on the prohibition of opium and the potential harm it could cause.\n\nB. Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China: This option is also not relevant, as the passage does not discuss missionary activities or their impact on China.\n\nC. Europe's economic domination of China: This option is somewhat relevant, as the passage mentions the export of beneficial products to foreign countries, which could be seen as a form of economic domination.\n\nD. Europe's colonization of Chinese territory: This option is not directly related to the passage, which focuses on the prohibition of opium and the potential harm it could cause.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the passage is most closely related with option C, which suggests Europe's economic domination of China.\n\nFinal answer: C. Europe's economic domination of China"
