The first quartile is the value below which 25% of the data falls. Therefore, the z-score for Q1 is -1.0.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n\u03c3 = -1.0 * (48,815 - 55,800)\n\u03c3 = -1.0 * (-6965)\n\u03c3 = 6965\n\nSo, the standard deviation is approximately $6,965. The correct answer is:\n\nA. $6,984"
