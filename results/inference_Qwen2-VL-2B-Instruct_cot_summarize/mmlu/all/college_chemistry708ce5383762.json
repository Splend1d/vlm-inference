                    "text": "The ionic strength (I) of a solution is calculated as the sum of the molar concentrations of all the ions in the solution. The ionic strength is a measure of the concentration of all ions in a solution, regardless of their charge.\n\nThe ionic strength of a solution is inversely proportional to the number of ions in the solution. This means that a solution with more ions will have a lower ionic strength, and a solution with fewer ions will have a higher ionic strength.\n\nIn this case, we are asked to determine which of the given solutions will have the highest ionic strength. To do this, we need to compare the molar concentrations of the ions in each solution.\n\nA. 0.050 M AlCl3 has a molar concentration of 0.050 M for both the aluminum (Al) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Therefore, the ionic strength of this solution is 0.050 M + 0.050 M = 0.100 M.\n\nB. 0.100 M NaCl has a molar concentration of 0.100 M for both the sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Therefore, the ionic strength of this solution is 0.100 M + 0.100 M = 0.200 M.\n\nC. 0.050 M CaCl2 has a molar concentration of 0.050 M for both the calcium (Ca2+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Therefore, the ionic strength of this solution is 0.050 M + 0.050 M = 0.100 M.\n\nD. 0.100 M HCl has a molar concentration of 0.100 M for the hydrogen (H+) ion. Therefore, the ionic strength of this solution is 0.100 M + 0.100 M = 0.200 M.\n\nComparing the ionic strengths of the solutions, we can see that the solution with the highest ionic strength is the one with the highest molar concentration of ions, which is solution D. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
