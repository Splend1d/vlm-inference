The velocity of the stone 3 seconds later can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv = v0 + a*t\n\nwhere v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time elapsed.\n\nSince the stone is thrown upward, the acceleration due to gravity is downward. Therefore, the acceleration is -9.8 m/s^2.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nv = 5 m/s + (-9.8 m/s^2) * 3 s\nv = 5 m/s - 29.4 m/s\nv = -24.4 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the stone 3 seconds later is -24.4 m/s, downward. The correct answer is:\n\nD. 35 m/s, downward"
