At this point, the firm is earning zero economic profit, as the marginal revenue is equal to the price and the marginal cost is equal to the average total cost (ATC). This is because the marginal revenue is equal to the ATC, and the marginal revenue is the revenue generated by selling one more unit of output. Therefore, the monopolist is earning zero economic profit.\n\nHowever, this situation does not necessarily mean that the monopolist will not enter the market in the long run. The monopolist may choose to enter the market if it can earn a profit in the long run. This is because the monopolist may be able to earn a profit in the long run by selling more output than it can produce at the current price. In this case, the monopolist will be able to earn a profit by selling more output than it can produce at the current price. Therefore, the monopolist may choose to enter the market in the long run to earn a profit."
