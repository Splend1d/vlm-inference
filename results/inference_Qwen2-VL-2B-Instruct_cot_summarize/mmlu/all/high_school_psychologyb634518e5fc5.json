Confirmation bias occurs when people tend to seek out and accept information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses, rather than critically evaluating new evidence. In this case, Shafi's focus on the math test scores of boys and girls, rather than considering the broader context of the class, is an example of confirmation bias."
