Appeal to Gallery (Provicialism)\n\nThe statement \"Surely, if we were as good a class as Professor Jones said we were, none of us deserved to fail\" is an example of an appeal to gallery (provicialism), which is a fallacy that occurs when someone assumes that because they are part of a group or a community, they are entitled to certain privileges or benefits. In this case, the speaker assumes that because they are in Professor Jones' class, they are entitled to a high grade."
