Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\n\nDworkin's support for liberal egalitarianism is based on the idea that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices and pursue their own interests, rather than being constrained by the state or other external forces. He argues that individual choice is the foundation of a just and equitable society, and that the state should not interfere with this process."
