He decided to break into the employee's house one night, when he knew that the employee and her family would be away, to try to find and retrieve the equipment. The man had brought a picklock to open the employee's back door, but when he tried the door, he found that it was unlocked, so he entered. As the man was looking around the house, he heard sounds outside and became afraid. He left the house but was arrested by police on neighborhood patrol. What is the man's strongest defense to a burglary charge?\n\nA. The back door to the house was unlocked.\nB. The burglary was abandoned.\nC. The house was not occupied at the time of his entry.\nD. The man did not intend to commit a crime inside the house.\n"

The house was not occupied at the time of his entry.\n\nThis defense suggests that the man did not have the necessary intent to commit a crime inside the house, as he was unaware that the house was occupied by the employee and her family. This lack of intent is a critical element in the defense of burglary, as it implies that the man did not have the necessary motive or opportunity to commit the crime."
