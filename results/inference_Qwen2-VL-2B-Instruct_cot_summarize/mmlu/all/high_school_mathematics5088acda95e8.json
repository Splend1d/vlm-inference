In 24 hours, there are 144 5-minute intervals (since 24 hours = 144 5-minute intervals).\n\nThe second computer backs up data every 2 minutes. In 24 hours, there are 144 2-minute intervals (since 24 hours = 144 2-minute intervals).\n\nThe overlap occurs when the first computer backs up at a time when the second computer is about to back up. This happens every 2 minutes (since 24 hours / 144 intervals = 1/60 of an hour, which is 2 minutes).\n\nTherefore, the number of times the two computers back up data at the same time in a 24-hour period is the number of 2-minute intervals in 24 hours, which is 144.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 144."
