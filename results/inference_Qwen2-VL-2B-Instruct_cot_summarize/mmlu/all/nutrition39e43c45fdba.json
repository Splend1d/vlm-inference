Are avoidable if the allergic agents are not allowed to exceed specified limits\n\nFood allergies are a type of food intolerance, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and reacts to certain food proteins. They usually occur after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure to the allergen. Food allergies can be avoidable if the allergic agents are not allowed to exceed specified limits, such as the amount of allergen in a food product or the frequency of exposure."
