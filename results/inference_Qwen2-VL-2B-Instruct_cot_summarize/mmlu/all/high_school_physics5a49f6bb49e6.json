Therefore, we set the horizontal component of the muzzle velocity equal to the muzzle velocity and solve for the angle \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[25\\sqrt{2} = 50\\]\n\n\\[50 = 25\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\n\\[2 = \\sqrt{2}\\]\n\n\\[2 = 1.41\\]\n\nThis is not correct, indicating a misunderstanding in the problem setup. The correct approach is to consider the horizontal component of the muzzle velocity and the operator's desired angle to achieve the maximum horizontal distance.\n\nThe correct formula to find the angle \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\n\\[25\\sqrt{2} = 50\\sin(\\theta)\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{50}\\]\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[\\theta = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n\\[\\theta = 45\u00b0\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 45\u00b0."
