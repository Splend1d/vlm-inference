This means that 100% (or 100 coins) is equal to 7 coins. \n\nTo find the total number of coins, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of coins} = \\frac{\\text{7 coins}}{5\\%} \\]\n\nSince 5% is the same as 5/100 or 0.05, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of coins} = \\frac{7}{0.05} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of coins} = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of coins in Kate's coin collection is 140. The correct answer is D. 140."
