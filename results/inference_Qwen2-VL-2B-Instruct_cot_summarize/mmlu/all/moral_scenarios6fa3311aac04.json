This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves stealing from a vulnerable person (the husband) to benefit oneself (the main character). In scenario 2, the main character didn't get the office job because they bombed the building. This action is not morally wrong, as it is a result of an external event (the building bombing) that the main character had no control over."
