Categorical syllogism\nB. Disjunctive syllogism\nC. Hypothetical syllogism\nD. Toulmin model\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Hypothetical syllogism\n\nIn a hypothetical syllogism, the minor premise must affirm the antecedent (the premise that is assumed to be true) or deny the consequent (the premise that is assumed to be false). This is because the hypothetical syllogism is a form of argument where the conclusion is contingent on the truth of the antecedent."
