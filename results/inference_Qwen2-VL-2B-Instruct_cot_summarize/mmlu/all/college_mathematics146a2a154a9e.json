The area of a triangle with base $b$ and height $h$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. In this case, the base is the circumference of the circle, which is $2\\pi$, and the height is the radius of the circle, which is 1. So the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi)(1) = \\pi$.\nTherefore, the greatest possible area of a triangular region with one vertex at the center of a circle of radius 1 and the other two vertices on the circle is $\\boxed{\\pi}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\pi}$."
