It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n"

Concern about barbarian attacks\n\nThe excerpt discusses the extermination of the Tencteri and Bructeri by the Chamavi and Angrivarii, which were likely barbarian peoples. The author expresses a desire for peace and harmony among the tribes, but also acknowledges the potential for conflict due to the \"destinies of empire\" and the \"favorable regard for us\" from the gods. This suggests a concern about barbarian attacks and the potential for conflict between different tribes."
