According to the problem, 48 vanilla milkshakes represent 40% of the total number of milkshakes sold. We can write this as:\n\n\\[0.40x = 48\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{48}{0.40}\\]\n\n\\[x = 120\\]\n\nTherefore, the ice cream shop sold a total of 120 milkshakes that day.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 120."
