Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nThe language of this passage by Susan B. Anthony demonstrates which of the following continuities in U.S. history?\n\nA. Debates over free speech.\nB. Debates over voting rights.\nC. Debates over federal power and states' rights.\nD. Debates over the procedures of amending the Constitution.\n"
