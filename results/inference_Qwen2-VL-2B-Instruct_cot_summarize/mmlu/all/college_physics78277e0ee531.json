If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength of the light will also double.\n\nThe relationship between the wavelength (\u03bb), frequency (f), and the separation of bright fringes (\u0394x) is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x = \\frac{\\lambda}{2d} \\]\n\nwhere \\( d \\) is the separation between the slits.\n\nGiven that the original wavelength is 0.5 \u03bcm and the frequency is doubled, the new wavelength will be:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{new} = 2 \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{\u03bcm} = 1 \\, \\text{\u03bcm} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the new wavelength to find the new separation of the bright fringes:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{new} = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{\u03bcm}}{2 \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{\u03bcm}} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \\, \\text{\u03bcm} \\]\n\nSince 1 millimeter is equal to 10000 micrometers, the separation of the bright fringes will be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta x_{new} = 2 \\times 10000 \\, \\text{\u03bcm} = 20000 \\, \\text{\u03bcm} = 20 \\, \\text{mm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the separation of the bright fringes will be 20 mm, which corresponds to option D."
