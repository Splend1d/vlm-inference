The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies. Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has led to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the emphasis on security studies was heavily influenced by the Cold War itself, with security studies being primarily focused on the Cold War era. This led to a narrow focus on security studies, excluding HM from mainstream study. However, as the security studies agenda broadened, HM began to gain prominence as an area for study. This was due to the growing recognition of the importance of security studies in understanding global security issues."
