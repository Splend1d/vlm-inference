For a 2 M HCl solution, we have:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{moles}{liter} \\]\n\n\\[ 2 = \\frac{moles}{liter} \\]\n\n\\[ moles = 2 \\times liter \\]\n\n\\[ moles = 2 \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ moles = 6 \\]\n\nSo, 6 moles of HCl must be added to water to form a 2 M HCl solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 6 mol"
