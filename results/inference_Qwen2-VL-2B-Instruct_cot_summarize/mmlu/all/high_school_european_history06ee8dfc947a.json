However, the passage does not indicate that Clemenceau was disgusted; instead, it describes his excitement and exhaustion.\n   - **Option B**: \"had grave doubts about France's ability to win a war against Germany.\"\n     - This option suggests that Clemenceau had concerns about France's military capabilities. The passage does not provide any information about Clemenceau's doubts about France's ability to win the war.\n   - **Option C**: \"would one day serve as prime minister of France.\"\n     - This option suggests that Clemenceau's future role in politics.

The passage describes Clemenceau's excitement and exhaustion, which implies that he was relieved to hear the news.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the passage, the most accurate inference is that Clemenceau was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war.\n\n**Final answer**: D. was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war."
