The dimension of the domain \\( V \\) being less than the dimension of the codomain \\( W \\) does not necessarily imply that \\( T \\) is injective. For example, consider the linear transformation \\( T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) defined by \\( T(x, y) = (0, 0) \\), where \\( \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 2 \\) and \\( \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 1 \\). This transformation is injective, but it is not defined on the entire space \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), which has a dimension of 2. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: Let \\( \\dim(V) = n \\) and suppose that \\( T: V \\rightarrow V \\) is linear. If \\( T \\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nThis statement is true. If \\( T \\) is injective, then it is a bijection. This is because an injective linear transformation \\( T \\) maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain, and thus, it must map distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nThe correct answer is D. False, True."
