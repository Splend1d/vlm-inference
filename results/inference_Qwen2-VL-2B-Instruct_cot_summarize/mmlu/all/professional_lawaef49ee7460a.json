However, the manufacturer is responsible for the installation and quality of the roof, which includes the installation of the roof and the installation of the truck. The manufacturer is aware of the installation and the truck's presence, so they have a duty to ensure the installation was done correctly.\n\n   - **Option B: No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.**\n     - This option suggests that the manufacturer is only liable for defects in the product that existed at the time it was sold. However, the manufacturer supplied nondefective materials to the installer, and the installer's truck was parked in front of the homeowner's house during the installation. This implies that the manufacturer had knowledge of the installation and the presence of the truck, which could be considered a breach of duty.\n\n   - **Option C: Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.**\n     - This option suggests that the manufacturer is liable for the installer's actions. However, the manufacturer is not liable for the installer's actions if the installer was acting within the scope of their franchise agreement. The manufacturer is not liable for the installer's actions if the installer was acting within the scope of their franchise agreement.\n\n   - **Option D: Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.**\n     - This option suggests that the manufacturer is liable because the installer was acting under the manufacturer's authority. However, the manufacturer is not liable for the installer's actions if the installer was acting within the scope of their franchise agreement. The manufacturer is not liable for the installer's actions if the installer was acting within the scope of their franchise agreement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The manufacturer is not liable for the installer's actions if the installer was acting within the scope of their franchise agreement. Therefore, the manufacturer is not liable for the installer's actions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee."
