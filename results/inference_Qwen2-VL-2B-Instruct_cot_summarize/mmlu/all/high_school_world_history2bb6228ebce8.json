They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA.

The Portuguese trade with Japan was characterized by the exchange of white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain for silver.\n2. The Portuguese brought silver from Japan and India to China, which they used to trade with China.\n3. The Portuguese also brought gold, musk, silk, copper, and other costly and gilded items from China to Japan.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The eastward expansion of Russia - This did not undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. Russia did not engage in trade with Japan or China during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.\n\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India - This undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. The Portuguese conquest of India disrupted the trade routes and the exchange of goods between China and India, which was a significant disruption in the trade patterns.\n\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate - This did not undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. The Tokugawa Shogunate did not have a significant impact on the trade patterns between China and Japan during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.\n\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico - This did not undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. The Spanish conquest of Mexico did not have a significant impact on the trade patterns between China and Japan during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.\n\nBased on the analysis, the development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is:\n\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India"
