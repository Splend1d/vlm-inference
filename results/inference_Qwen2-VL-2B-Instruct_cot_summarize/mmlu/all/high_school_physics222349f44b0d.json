The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields.\n\nThe electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{kQ}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the electric field, \\( k \\) is a constant, \\( Q \\) is the charge on the plane, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the plane.\n\nAs the distance \\( r \\) increases, the electric field \\( E \\) decreases because the inverse square of the distance is involved in the formula. This is because the electric field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge source.\n\nThe other options do not follow the inverse square relationship for distances far from the objects producing the fields:\n\nA. The electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the rod, but not for distances far from the charge source.\n\nB. The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the cylinder, but not for distances far from the charge source.\n\nD. The magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the wire, but not for distances far from the charge source.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
