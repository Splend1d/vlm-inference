In this situation, the little cousin's behavior of trying to use the keyboard immediately after you get up can be explained by classical conditioning, as it is likely that he has learned to associate the sound of the keyboard with the act of getting up, and as a result, he is now conditioned to react with a desire to use the keyboard."
