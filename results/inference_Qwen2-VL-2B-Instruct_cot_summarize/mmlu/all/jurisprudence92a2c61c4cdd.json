Because Aristotle believed that man is a 'social animal'\n\nCommunitarianism, which emphasizes the importance of community and social relationships, is more closely aligned with Aristotle's philosophy than Kant's. Aristotle's philosophy is often associated with the concept of the \"polis,\" or city-state, which is a community of people living together for the common good. This idea is reflected in Aristotle's views on justice, ethics, and politics, which emphasize the importance of community and the role of the state in promoting the common good. In contrast, Kant's philosophy is more focused on individual rights and duties, and does not emphasize the importance of community or the role of the state in promoting the common good."
