Routine buying.\n\nRoutine buying is the least effortful type of consumer buying behavior because it involves a process that is already familiar to the consumer, and they do not need to search for new information or make a decision. Routine buying typically involves buying items that are used regularly and are not particularly expensive or complex. Therefore, it requires the least amount of effort compared to other types of buying behaviors."
