The corona is made up mostly of charged particles which aren't luminous.\nThe Sun's corona is made up of charged particles, such as protons and electrons, which are not luminous. These charged particles are responsible for the emission of X-rays and other types of radiation, but they do not emit visible light. Therefore, we cannot see the Sun's corona except during total solar eclipses."
