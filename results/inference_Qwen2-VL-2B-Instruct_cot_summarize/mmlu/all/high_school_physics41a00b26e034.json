The only force acting horizontally is the force of gravity (mg), which is constant and does not change with the incline's angle.\n   - Therefore, ax = 0.\n\n2. **Vertical Acceleration (ay)**:\n   - The car is accelerating vertically upward due to the force of gravity (mg).\n   - The acceleration due to gravity (g) is constant and does not change with the incline's angle.\n   - Therefore, ay = g.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. ax = 0; ay = g**"
