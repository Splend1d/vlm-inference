On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires.\n\nNaturalism is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the importance of objective, universal principles in the development of law and society. It suggests that laws and regulations should be based on objective, universal principles that are applicable to all members of society. Naturalists believe that laws should be based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope, and that these rules should be applied consistently and impartially to all individuals.\n\nPositivism, on the other hand, is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the importance of structured and coherent legal systems that are created by States in light of their interests and desires. It suggests that laws and regulations should be based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires. Positivists believe that laws should be based on a set of rules that are created by States in light of their interests and desires, and that these rules should be applied consistently and impartially to all individuals.\n\nTherefore, the major difference between naturalism and positivism is that naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope, while positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires."
