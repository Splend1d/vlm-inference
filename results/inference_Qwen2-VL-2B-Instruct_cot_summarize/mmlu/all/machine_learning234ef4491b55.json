VGGNets, like AlexNet, have convolutional kernels of the same width and height as the first layer.\n\nStatement 2: Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization.\n- This statement is false. Batch Normalization was introduced after data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
