A ring, on the other hand, is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain properties, including the existence of an additive identity and the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. Therefore, every field is indeed a ring.\n\nStatement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.\n- A ring is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain properties, including the existence of an additive identity and the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. The multiplicative identity in a ring is the element that, when multiplied by any other element in the ring, leaves the element unchanged. Therefore, every ring indeed has a multiplicative identity.\n\nBoth statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
