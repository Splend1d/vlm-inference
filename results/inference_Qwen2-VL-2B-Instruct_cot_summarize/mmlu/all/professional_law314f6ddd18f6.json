This is true even though there is considerable mining of silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone within the state. As a result, the largest platinum mining company in the state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?\n\nA. The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\nB. The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\nC. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest.\nD. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n"

The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\n\nThis option focuses on the principle of least restrictive means, which is a fundamental principle in constitutional law that requires the state to use the most neutral and least intrusive means to achieve its goals. In this context, the state must demonstrate that the tax on platinum extraction is the least restrictive means to achieve its legitimate purpose of raising revenue from the extraction of platinum. If the state can show that the tax is necessary to achieve its goal without being the least restrictive means, the court may find the statute unconstitutional.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the state must prove that the classification is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest, not that it is the least restrictive means.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the mining company must prove that the classification is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest, not that it is the least restrictive means.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the mining company must prove that the classification is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest, not that it is the least restrictive means."
