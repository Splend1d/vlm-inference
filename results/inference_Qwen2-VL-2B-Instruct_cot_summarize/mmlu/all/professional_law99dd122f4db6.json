Neighbor, who owns the adjacent property to the East, built a driveway whose western boundary is along the border of homeowner's property. The excavator dug the driveway five feet deep. The land began to subside along the line of excavation and about three feet of homeowner's land fell off into the driveway, making that part of her property useless. Homeowner demanded that neighbor fill in the property to buttress the erosion created. That was not done and the erosion continued to occur. Homeowner sued and asked for an injunction compelling the neighbor to build and maintain a retaining wall. Will the court rule for the plaintiff/homeowner?\n\nA. Yes, because excavation is an abnormally dangerous activity and neighbor is absolutely liable for any damages caused by the violation.\nB. Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\nC. No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land.\nD. No, the right to lateral support is a common law right that has been abrogated by statute in virtually all states so that the right no longer exists.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court will rule in favor of the homeowner, we need to analyze the legal principles and the context provided in the scenario.\n\n1. **Nature of the Question**: The question revolves around the homeowner's right to lateral support of the soil in its natural state and the neighbor's obligation to fill in the excavation to buttress the erosion.\n\n2. **Legal Context**: The homeowner's property is in its natural condition, and there was no fill on the property. The neighbor built a driveway that extends along the border of the homeowner's property. The excavation was five feet deep, and the land began to subside, causing three feet of the homeowner's property to fall off into the excavation.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n\n   - **Option A**: \"Yes, because excavation is an abnormally dangerous activity and neighbor is absolutely liable for any damages caused by the violation.\"\n     - This option suggests that the neighbor is absolutely liable for any damages caused by the excavation. However, the scenario does not explicitly state that the excavation was abnormally dangerous or that the neighbor is solely responsible for the damages. The neighbor's actions were confined to their own property, and the excavation was done on the homeowner's property.\n\n   - **Option B**: \"Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\"\n     - This option suggests that the homeowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state. However, the scenario does not explicitly state that the homeowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state. The neighbor's actions were confined to their own property, and the excavation was done on the homeowner's property.\n\n   - **Option C**: \"No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land.\"\n     - This option suggests that the neighbor did not violate the homeowner's right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state. The neighbor's actions were confined to their own property, and the excavation was done on the homeowner's property.\n\n   - **Option D**: \"No, the right to lateral support is a common law right that has been abrogated by statute in virtually all states so that the right no longer exists.\"\n     - This option suggests that the right to lateral support is no longer a common law right. However, the scenario does not provide enough information to determine whether the right to lateral support has been abrogated by statute.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n   **Option C**: \"No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land.\"\n\nThe court will likely rule against the homeowner because the neighbor did not violate the homeowner's right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state."
