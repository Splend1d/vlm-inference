If the driver was driving negligently, the claimant (the girl's parents) would have a stronger case for recovery. Negligence means that the driver was not acting with the level of care and attention required in the circumstances, which could include not being aware of the girl's vulnerability or not taking appropriate action to avoid the accident. If the driver was driving within the posted speed limit, the claim would not be as strong, as the driver would not be considered negligent. If the accident was caused by the boy's pushing, the claim would not be as strong, as the boy would not be considered negligent.
