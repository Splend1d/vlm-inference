The Chinese government was also known for its centralized bureaucratic state.\n   - **Russian administration:** The Mongol administration in Russia was more focused on maintaining control over the Russian principalities and was less tolerant of other religions. The administration relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities and was more centralized.\n\n2. **Analyze each option:**\n   - **A. was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, while the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions:** This option is incorrect because the Chinese administration was not only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity but also of other religious traditions.\n   - **B. relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state:** This option is incorrect because the Mongol administration in Russia did not emulate a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state; it was more focused on maintaining control over the Russian principalities.\n   - **C. was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest:** This option is incorrect because the Mongol administration in Russia was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest.\n   - **D. stimulated Russian export of trade goods to China, while the Mongol administration in China intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity:** This option is incorrect because the Mongol administration in Russia did not intentionally curtail Chinese economic activity; it was more focused on maintaining control over the Russian principalities.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\nThe Mongol administration in Russia was more focused on maintaining control over the Russian principalities and was less tolerant of other religions compared to the Mongol administration in China. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state.**"
