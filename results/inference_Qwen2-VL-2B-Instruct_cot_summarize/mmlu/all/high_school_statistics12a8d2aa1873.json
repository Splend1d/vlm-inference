                    "text": "To determine which statement is true with respect to the confidence level used, we need to understand the concept of confidence intervals and how they relate to the confidence level.\n\nA confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter, such as the mean weight of oranges. The confidence level is the probability that the interval will contain the true value. In this case, the 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance that the true mean weight of oranges falls within the interval (7.58, 8.72) ounces.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.**\n   - This statement is true. The 95% confidence interval indicates that if we were to take multiple samples and construct confidence intervals for each sample, 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean weight of the oranges.\n\nB. **In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges.**\n   - This statement is false. The 95% confidence interval is based on the sample mean, not the sampled mean. The confidence interval is calculated around the sample mean, not around the individual sample means.\n\nC. **Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.**\n   - This statement is false. The 95% confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true mean weight of the oranges. It does not imply that 95% of the oranges in the sample weigh within this range.\n\nD. **Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.**\n   - This statement is false. The 95% confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true mean weight of the oranges. It does not imply that 95% of the oranges of the variety weigh within this range.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**A. In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.**"
