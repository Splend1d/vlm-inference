It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nThe excerpt from Frederick Douglass is most clearly an example of which of the following developments in the mid-nineteenth century?\n\nA.

Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\n\nThis is evident from the passage, which describes how the Southern states, particularly the slaveholding states, have organized themselves to support and defend the institution of slavery, as evidenced by the presence of the Federal Government's army and navy, the Supreme Court, and the Chief Magistracy in Washington, all of which are pledged to support and defend slavery. This shows that the Southern states were actively working to maintain and defend the institution of slavery, which was a significant development in the mid-nineteenth century."
