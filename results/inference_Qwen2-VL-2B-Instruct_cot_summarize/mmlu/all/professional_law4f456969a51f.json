State law provided that if he tried to leave against medical advice, the hospital could hold him for 72 hours while trying to convince him to stay. During the stay, he told his medical providers that he was intensely angry at his wife, who was living with another man, and he wanted to harm her. Despite that knowledge, the hospital issued him an unrestricted weekend pass. When he got out he shot and killed his wife. The man's children sued the hospital for negligence. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss mainly because there was no privity with the decedent and no duty owed to her. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the hospital is strictly liable for releasing patients who it knows or should know represent an unreasonable danger to third persons.\nB. No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an in-patient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.\nC. Yes, because there is no duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others.\nD. Yes, because the intervening acts of third parties are unforeseeable and cannot give rise to liability.\n"

The key issue here is whether the hospital owed a duty to the decedent, who was a patient, and whether the hospital's actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n1. **Duty to Control the Conduct of Another Person**: The hospital's duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others is a fundamental principle in medical negligence cases. The hospital is held strictly liable for releasing patients who it knows or should know represent an unreasonable danger to third persons.\n\n2. **Intervening Acts of Third Parties**: The court will likely consider whether the hospital's actions were reasonable in the context of the situation. If the hospital knew or should have known that the man was a danger to his wife and was likely to harm her, and the hospital released him with an unrestricted weekend pass, it would be reasonable to conclude that the hospital breached its duty to prevent foreseeable harm.\n\n3. **Special Relationship and Control**: The hospital's duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others is particularly relevant here. The hospital's control over the patient's behavior is a critical factor in determining whether it owed a duty to prevent harm.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to conclude that the hospital's actions were reasonable under the circumstances, and therefore, the motion to dismiss will likely be granted.\n\n**Final Answer: B. No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an in-patient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.**"
