When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States.\n\nThe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a region within a coastal state's territory that is subject to certain rules and regulations. The coastal state has the right to regulate and manage its EEZ, including the fishing rights within it. However, if the coastal state cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch' within its EEZ, it is required to give other states access to that surplus with priority to developing and land-locked states. This ensures that the coastal state can still manage its EEZ and ensure sustainable fishing practices."
