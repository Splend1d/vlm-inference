Fallacy of Division\n\nJohn Stuart Mill's statement is an example of the fallacy of division, which occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a general statement about the aggregate of a group to a conclusion about the individual members of that group. In this case, Mill is suggesting that the happiness of each person is a good to that person, and the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all persons. This is a form of the fallacy of division, where the conclusion is drawn from a general statement about the aggregate to a conclusion about the individual members."
