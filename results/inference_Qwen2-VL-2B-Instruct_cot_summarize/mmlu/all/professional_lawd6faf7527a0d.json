On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: \"To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: \"To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman. The husband then dies. The brother then dies.

In this case, the woman sells her undivided one-half interest in the land to the husband and wife for $100,000. This means that the husband and wife now own the entire tract of land, and the woman's undivided one-half interest is no longer a separate entity.\n\nThe husband then sells his undivided one-half interest to the husband and his brother for $125,000.

This means that the cousin now owns the entire tract of land, and the husband's undivided one-half interest is no longer a separate entity.\n\nTherefore, the cousin is the owner of an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. an undivided one-half interest in the land."
