The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140\u2013200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c?\n\nA. His daily glucose control is better than recorded\nB. His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced\nC. His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated\nD. His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c\n"

His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated\n\nThis is because the patient's hemoglobin A1c level is significantly elevated, which is not typical for a patient with type 1 diabetes who has been treated with insulin and dietary management for 6 years. The elevated hemoglobin A1c could be due to a laboratory error, such as a falsely high reading on the glucometer, which would result in an elevated A1c level. It is important to repeat the hemoglobin A1c test to confirm the results and ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment."
