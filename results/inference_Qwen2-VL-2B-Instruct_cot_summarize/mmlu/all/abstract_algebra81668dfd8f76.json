In this case, the identity element is the element that, when multiplied by any other element in the group, leaves the other element unchanged.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. 6: Multiplying 6 by any element in the group (2, 4, 6, 8) will result in a different element in the group. For example, 6 * 2 = 12, 6 * 4 = 24, 6 * 6 = 36, and 6 * 8 = 48. So, 6 is not the identity element.\n\nB. 8: Multiplying 8 by any element in the group (2, 4, 6, 8) will result in a different element in the group. For example, 8 * 2 = 16, 8 * 4 = 32, 8 * 6 = 48, and 8 * 8 = 64. So, 8 is not the identity element.\n\nC. 4: Multiplying 4 by any element in the group (2, 4, 6, 8) will result in a different element in the group. For example, 4 * 2 = 8, 4 * 4 = 16, 4 * 6 = 24, and 4 * 8 = 32. So, 4 is not the identity element.\n\nD. 2: Multiplying 2 by any element in the group (2, 4, 6, 8) will result in a different element in the group. For example, 2 * 2 = 4, 2 * 4 = 8, 2 * 6 = 12, and 2 * 8 = 16. So, 2 is the identity element.\n\nTherefore, the identity element in the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8) under multiplication modulo 10 is D. 2."
