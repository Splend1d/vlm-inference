This means that the seller had a lien on the property before the buyer executed the second note. The buyer's note was secured by a mortgage, which was not secured by a mortgage. Therefore, the bank's mortgage was not a purchase money mortgage, and the bank's mortgage was not a first lien. Therefore, the bank's mortgage was not a priority lien. Therefore, the seller has priority. Therefore, the answer is D."
