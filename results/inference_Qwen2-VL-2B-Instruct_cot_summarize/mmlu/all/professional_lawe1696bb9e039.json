On September 15, a worldwide shortage of widgets caused a steep increase in the market price for widgets, so the seller decided not to deliver the widgets to the buyer. The seller sent a letter to the buyer, stating that the widgets would not be delivered. The buyer received the seller's letter on September 20. On October 15, the buyer filed suit against the seller for breach of contract. In determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled, which of the following would be taken as the market price of widgets?\n\nA. The market price on September 1.\nB. The market price on September 15.\nC. The market price on September 20.\nD. The market price on September 30.\n"

This is because the buyer had contracted to purchase widgets at a price of $1 per widget, and the seller's decision to not deliver the widgets on September 15 would have resulted in the buyer receiving widgets at a price lower than the agreed-upon price. Therefore, the market price on September 15 would be the appropriate reference point for calculating the buyer's damages. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The market price on September 15."
