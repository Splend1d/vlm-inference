Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Illicit cash flow to tax havens from rich countries exceeds aid to the world's poor.\n- This option suggests that there is a significant amount of money flowing out of rich countries to tax havens, which could be seen as a form of illegal or unethical activity. However, it does not directly address the rights of the world's poor. It focuses on the economic activities of rich countries rather than the rights of the poor.\n\nB. The implementation of neoliberal economic policies have had at mixed and at worse adverse impacts of the economic and social rights of the world's poor.\n- This option directly addresses the impact of neoliberal economic policies on the rights of the world's poor. It mentions that these policies have mixed and adverse impacts, which aligns with Ashford's thesis that global social institutions violate the rights of the poor.\n\nC. That wealthy nations press their political and economic advantages to secure unfair trade agreements with poor countries.\n- This option discusses the political and economic advantages of wealthy nations in securing unfair trade agreements with poor countries. While it touches on the economic aspect, it does not directly address the rights of the poor.\n\nD. All of the above.\n- This option encompasses both A and B, as it mentions both the economic and social impacts of global social institutions on the rights of the poor.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best supports Ashford's thesis is:\n\nB. The implementation of neoliberal economic policies have had at mixed and at worse adverse impacts of the economic and social rights of the world's poor.\n\nFinal answer: B."
