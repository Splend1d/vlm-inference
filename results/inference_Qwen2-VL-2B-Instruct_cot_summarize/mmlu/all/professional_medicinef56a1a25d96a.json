Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Conversion disorder\nB. Histrionic personality disorder\nC.

Somatic symptom disorder\n\nSomatic symptom disorder is a condition characterized by persistent, distressing physical symptoms that are not caused by identifiable physical illness. These symptoms may be described as vague, nonspecific, or nonspecific, and they may be accompanied by a variety of physical symptoms, including abdominal pain. The patient in this case has a long history of recurrent abdominal pain, which has not been definitively diagnosed despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations, and multiple surgical explorations. The patient's dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms and her conflicting statements about her history suggest a somatic symptom disorder."
