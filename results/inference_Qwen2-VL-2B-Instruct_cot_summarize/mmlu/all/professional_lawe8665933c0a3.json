The head of the department has promulgated the following hiring rule: \"Because the rich are the source of all problems of society and cannot understand the plight of the poor, anyone who has a net worth over $10,000.00 is ineligible for employment with this department.\" Immediately, 25 employees in the department are fired due to their net worth above the designated level. They sue the state. Which of the following is the correct analysis and conclusion?\n\nA. The action is arbitrary and capricious, so it is unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny standard.\nB. The action is not deemed done by a state actor because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function.\nC. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\nD. Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny.\n"

The key issue here is whether the rule is arbitrary and capricious, which is a standard for determining whether a state action is constitutional under the strict scrutiny standard.\n\nLet's break down the analysis:\n\n1. **Hiring Rule Analysis:**\n   - The rule states that anyone with a net worth over $10,000.00 is ineligible for employment with the department.\n   - 25 employees were fired due to their net worth exceeding the threshold.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Rule:**\n   - The rule is based on the premise that the rich are the source of all problems and cannot understand the plight of the poor.\n   - The rule discriminates against employees based on their net worth, which is a financial characteristic.\n   - The rule is not based on any legitimate government function, such as providing public employment or addressing economic inequality.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The rule is arbitrary and capricious because it discriminates based on a financial characteristic (net worth) without any legitimate government function.\n   - The rule is not a state actor because it is not a governmental action.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The action is not deemed done by a state actor because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function.**"
