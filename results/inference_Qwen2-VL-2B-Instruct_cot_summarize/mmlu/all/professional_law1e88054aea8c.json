The neighbor who owns property adjacent to the farm knows of the friends' use of the property during the hunting season. One day during the hunting season, without the farmer's knowledge or permission, the neighbor took a shortcut across the farm to visit an acquaintance. The neighbor was wounded by a shot fired by one of the farmer's friends, who was shooting at quail and carelessly failed to see the neighbor. Traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability apply. In an action by the neighbor against the farmer to recover for the injuries, will the neighbor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing.\nC. Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.\nD. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

                    "text": "The neighbor's claim against the farmer will likely be upheld, but the reasoning behind this conclusion is nuanced and involves several legal principles.\n\n1. **Traditional Rules of Landowners' and Occupiers' Liability**: This principle applies when a person is injured due to the negligence or carelessness of another person on their property. The neighbor's injury was caused by a careless act of a friend who was hunting without safety training. This is a classic example of negligence.\n\n2. **Abnormally Dangerous Activities**: The use of firearms is generally considered an abnormally dangerous activity. This means that the risk of injury is significantly higher than for other activities. The neighbor was injured by a firearm, which is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\n3. **Permit to Hunt**: The neighbor was not trespassing. The neighbor had permission to visit the neighbor's property during the hunting season. The neighbor's visit was not unauthorized, and the neighbor had the right to use the property for their own purposes.\n\n4. **Careless Conduct**: The neighbor was not trespassing, and the neighbor's injury was caused by the careless act of a friend who was hunting without safety training. This is a clear case of negligence.\n\nGiven these points, the neighbor is likely to prevail in the action against the farmer. The farmer's failure to provide safety training to his friends and the neighbor's injury due to the careless act of a friend are key factors that support the neighbor's claim.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity."
