At trial, the pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. The defendants have filed a motion for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.\nB. No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\nC. Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.\nD.

The key issue here is the burden of proof and the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\nThe pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. This means that the pedestrian has failed to prove that any particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the injury. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's conduct was the cause of the injury. If the plaintiff cannot prove this, the court will grant the motion for a directed verdict.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm."
