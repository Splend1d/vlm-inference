                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball.\n\nWhen a tennis ball is dropped and falls 6 meters, it experiences air resistance, which causes the ball to accelerate more than predicted by the kinematic equations. This is because air resistance opposes the motion of the ball, causing it to accelerate in the opposite direction of its motion. As a result, the predicted velocity is 20% above the measured velocity by the photogate."
