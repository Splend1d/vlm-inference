The author argues that it is silly to pass laws against discrimination because discrimination is a natural part of human behavior and we cannot avoid it. However, the passage then contradicts itself by stating that we can't live without discriminating. This inconsistency suggests that the author is not fully consistent in their argument. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Inconsistency"
