This is possible because the collection can contain graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges, which is the maximum number of edges possible with 10 nodes. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\n**Option B: M = 10, m = 1**\n\n- If the maximum number of connected components is 10, and the minimum number of connected components is 1, then the collection must contain graphs with 10 nodes and 1 edge. This is not possible because the collection contains graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges, which is the maximum number of edges possible with 10 nodes. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\n**Option C: M = 7, m = 4**\n\n- If the maximum number of connected components is 7, and the minimum number of connected components is 4, then the collection must contain graphs with 7 nodes and 4 edges. This is possible because the collection can contain graphs with 7 nodes and 6 edges, which is the maximum number of edges possible with 7 nodes. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\n**Option D: M = 6, m = 4**\n\n- If the maximum number of connected components is 6, and the minimum number of connected components is 4, then the collection must contain graphs with 6 nodes and 4 edges. This is possible because the collection can contain graphs with 6 nodes and 6 edges, which is the maximum number of edges possible with 6 nodes. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**Option C: M = 7, m = 4**"
