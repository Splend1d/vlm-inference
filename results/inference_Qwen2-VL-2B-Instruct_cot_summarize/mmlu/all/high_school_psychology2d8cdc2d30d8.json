The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?\n\nA. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores\nB. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\nC.

The school psychologist should be concerned about whether the inclusion of the school interest inventory score will increase the multiple correlation between the aptitude and achievement test scores and first-year high school GPA.
