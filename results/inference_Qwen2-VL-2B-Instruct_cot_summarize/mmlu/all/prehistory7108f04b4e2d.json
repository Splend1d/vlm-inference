It involves collecting and analyzing evidence, such as artifacts, remains, and texts, to understand the history and culture of a particular time and place. Archaeologists are constrained by the evidence they have, which can be limited by the availability of artifacts, the quality of the evidence, and the limitations of the scientific method itself. Therefore, archaeology differs from pseudoscientific speculation and fantasies about ancient extraterrestrial life because it is grounded in the scientific method and relies on evidence to make its conclusions."
