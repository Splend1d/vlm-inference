We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean (or proportion) of a large sample will be approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. However, the sampling distribution of the mean (or proportion) of a small sample may not be normal, especially if the sample size is small relative to the population size. This is because the Central Limit Theorem applies to the sampling distribution of the mean, not the population mean. Therefore, we use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means."
