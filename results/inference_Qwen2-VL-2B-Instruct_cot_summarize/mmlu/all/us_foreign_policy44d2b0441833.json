It leads to a diminished focus on security, power and interest\n\nRealists tend to object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy because they believe that it leads to a diminished focus on security, power, and interest. They argue that exceptionalism can lead to a focus on the interests of individual countries rather than the collective security and well-being of the international community. This can result in a lack of attention to the needs and concerns of other countries, which can lead to conflicts and instability in the world."
