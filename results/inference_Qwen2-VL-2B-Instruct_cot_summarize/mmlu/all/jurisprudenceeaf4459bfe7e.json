                    "text": "The problem involves understanding the principles of the will theory of rights and how they relate to the interest theory. The will theory of rights asserts that the enforcement of Y's duty requires the exercise of will by X, implying a correlativity between rights and duties. The interest theory, on the other hand, suggests that an interest should be recognized as a reason for imposing duties, without assuming a correlativity between rights and duties.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.\n- This option suggests that X's interest is directly related to Y's duty, which aligns with the will theory of rights. It does not address the interest theory's assumption of a correlativity between rights and duties.\n\nB. Accepting that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.\n- This option suggests that recognizing a right means recognizing the interest associated with it. This aligns with the interest theory's premise that an interest should be recognized as a reason for imposing duties, without assuming a correlativity between rights and duties.\n\nC. Treating an interest as the exercise of choice.\n- This option suggests treating an interest as a choice, which is not aligned with the interest theory's premise that an interest should be recognized as a reason for imposing duties. It does not address the correlativity between rights and duties.\n\nD. Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties -only when they are actually imposed.\n- This option suggests that X has a right when his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties, but it does not address the assumption of a correlativity between rights and duties.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the one that succeeds in formulating the interest theory without assuming a correlativity between rights and duties is:\n\nB. Accepting that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.\n\nFinal answer: B."
