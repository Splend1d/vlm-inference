Since the distribution is normally distributed, we can use the Z-score to find these values.\n\nThe Z-score is calculated as:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( X \\) is the value we're interested in,\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (3,250 customers),\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (320 customers).\n\nFor the middle 50 percent, we want to find the Z-scores that correspond to the 25th and 75th percentiles. These Z-scores are approximately -0.67 and 0.67, respectively.\n\nUsing the Z-score formula:\n\n\\[ -0.67 = \\frac{X - 3250}{320} \\]\n\\[ 0.67 = \\frac{X - 3250}{320} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ -0.67 \\times 320 = X - 3250 \\]\n\\[ 20.84 = X - 3250 \\]\n\\[ X = 3250 + 20.84 \\]\n\\[ X = 3270.84 \\]\n\nSo, the values that divide the distribution into two equal parts are approximately 3,250 and 3,270.84.\n\nTherefore, the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is:\n\n\\[ (3,250, 3,270.84) \\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA.
