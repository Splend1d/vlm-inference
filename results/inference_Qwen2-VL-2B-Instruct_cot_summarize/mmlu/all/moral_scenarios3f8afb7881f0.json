This action is morally wrong because it violates the principle of parental responsibility and the right of children to learn and develop independently. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) ate all the candy their mother bought for their sister. This action is not morally wrong because it is a personal choice and does not involve any harm to others or a violation of any moral standards."
