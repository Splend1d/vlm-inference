If this statement is true, it could support a claim for fraud, as fraud involves making a false statement with the intent to deceive. Misrepresentation, on the other hand, involves making a false statement without the intent to deceive, which is not supported by Robert's statement. Therefore, the correct answer is B. fraud."
