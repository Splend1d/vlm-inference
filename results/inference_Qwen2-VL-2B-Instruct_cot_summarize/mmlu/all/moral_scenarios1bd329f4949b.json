This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It involves the theft of a deer's head, which is a violation of the animal's rights and the law.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character wrote a prescription for the sick child. This action is not clearly morally wrong. Writing a prescription is a legal and ethical practice in healthcare, and it does not involve any violation of the child's rights or the law."
