This inflationary pressure pushed up the cost of living, making it more expensive for people to buy the same amount of goods and services as they had in the past. As a result, the purchasing power of their income decreased, leading to a decline in their real income. This decline in real income was a significant factor in the growth of income inequality during that time."
