The newspaper would not be liable because, under the First Amendment's freedom of the press, the newspaper was privileged to publish the story.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the press the right to publish the news of public interest, which includes reporting on matters of public concern. Therefore, the newspaper's publication of the story about the senator's alleged ties to organized crime was protected by the First Amendment, and the newspaper would not be liable for defamation."
