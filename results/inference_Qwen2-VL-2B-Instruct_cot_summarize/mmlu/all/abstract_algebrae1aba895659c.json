The field Q (the set of rational numbers) is indeed an extension field of the field Z_2 (the set of integers modulo 2), which is a subfield of Q.\n\nStatement 2: Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is false. While it is true that every non-constant polynomial over a field has at least one root in the field itself, it is not necessarily true that it has a zero in every extension field. For example, the polynomial \\(x^2 - 1\\) over the field of real numbers has no real roots, but it has a root in the field of complex numbers, which is an extension field of the real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
