Some people may not experience pleasure when they get what they want, and even those who do may not always experience it in the same way. Additionally, the experience of pleasure can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as the context in which the pleasure is experienced, the person's mood at the time, and the person's overall level of happiness. Therefore, while the claim that we always feel pleasure when we get what we want is a widely held belief, it is not necessarily true, and it does not necessarily support psychological egoism."
