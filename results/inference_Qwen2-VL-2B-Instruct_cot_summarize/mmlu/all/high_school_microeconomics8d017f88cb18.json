                    "text": "To determine the reasonable prediction for the new price and quantity of apples, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Apple Market Equilibrium**: The apple market is in equilibrium, meaning the supply equals the demand.\n\n2. **Increase in Pesticide Usage**: Apple growers are using more pesticides to increase apple production. This increase in pesticide use is likely to lead to higher production costs for apple growers, which could potentially affect the price of apples.\n\n3. **Rising Price of Pears**: The price of pears is rising. Since pears are a substitute for apples, an increase in the price of pears would likely lead to a decrease in the demand for apples.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider each option:\n\nA. **Price rises, but quantity is ambiguous**:\n   - If the price of apples rises, it could lead to a decrease in demand for apples, potentially causing the quantity to fall. However, the equilibrium condition is that the supply equals the demand, so the quantity could still be ambiguous if the demand is not fully met by the supply.\n\nB. **Price falls, but quantity is ambiguous**:\n   - If the price of apples falls, it could lead to an increase in demand for apples, potentially causing the quantity to rise. However, the equilibrium condition is that the supply equals the demand, so the quantity could still be ambiguous if the demand is not fully met by the supply.\n\nC. **Price is ambiguous, but quantity rises**:\n   - If the price of apples is ambiguous, it could lead to an increase in demand for apples, potentially causing the quantity to rise. However, the equilibrium condition is that the supply equals the demand, so the quantity could still be ambiguous if the demand is not fully met by the supply.\n\nD. **Price is ambiguous, but quantity falls**:\n   - If the price of apples is ambiguous, it could lead to a decrease in demand for apples, potentially causing the quantity to fall. However, the equilibrium condition is that the supply equals the demand, so the quantity could still be ambiguous if the demand is not fully met by the supply.\n\nGiven the information, the most reasonable prediction is that the price of apples is ambiguous, but the quantity rises. This is because the increase in demand for apples due to the rise in the price of pears is likely to outweigh the decrease in demand due to the increase in pesticide use.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Price is ambiguous, but quantity rises."
