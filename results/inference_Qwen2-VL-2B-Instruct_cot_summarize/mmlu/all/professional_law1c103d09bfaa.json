Based on the evidence presented at these hearings, a senator wishes to introduce a bill providing free medical and hospital care for all citizens 70 years of age and older. The senator, however, intends to include a provision in the bill denying such medical and hospital care benefits to aliens (in the same age category) unless they have been legally admitted for permanent U. S. residency. The senator has asked for your advice regarding his proposed bill. You are understandably concerned about the legality of the aliens proviso. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the provision disqualifying aliens from receiving such medical and hospital benefits?\n\nA. Due to the fact that the medical and hospital benefits will be paid for by the government, they are a privilege not a right and, therefore, are not within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\nB. The disqualifying provision does not unduly burden either interstate commerce or the right of aliens to travel freely from state to state.\nC. The principles of equal protection apply against the states and not against the federal government.\nD. The disqualifying provision is reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives under its immigration, citizenship, and spending powers.\n"

The disqualifying provision is reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives under its immigration, citizenship, and spending powers.\n\nThis option highlights that the provision is justified by the senator's intent to address the issue of elderly citizens who cannot afford proper medical and hospital treatment, which is a legitimate concern related to immigration, citizenship, and spending powers. It does not unduly burden interstate commerce or the right of aliens to travel freely from state to state, and it is not an infringement on the right to travel freely. The provision is also reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives, as it aims to provide medical and hospital care to elderly citizens who may not otherwise be able to afford it."
