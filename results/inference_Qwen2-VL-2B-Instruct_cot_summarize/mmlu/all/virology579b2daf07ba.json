Children exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL\n- This group would not be a control group because it includes children who are already at risk for leukemia due to exposure to the chemical waste.\n\nB. Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL\n- This group would be a control group because it includes children who are not exposed to the chemical waste and do not have leukemia, thus controlling for the potential confounding factor of exposure to the chemical waste.\n\nC. Children from the hospital's outpatient clinic who do not suffer from ALL\n- This group would not be a control group because it includes children who are not exposed to the chemical waste but are still at risk for leukemia due to other factors.\n\nD. Children not exposed to the chemical waste who suffer from ALL\n- This group would not be a control group because it includes children who are already at risk for leukemia due to exposure to the chemical waste.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate control group is:\n\nB.
