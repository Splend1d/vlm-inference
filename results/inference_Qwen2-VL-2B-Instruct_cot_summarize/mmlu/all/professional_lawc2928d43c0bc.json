The man has \u00d2Beware of Dogs\u00d3 signs clearly posted around a fenced-in yard where he keeps the dogs. The man\u00d5s next-door neighbor frequently walks past the man\u00d5s house and knows about the dogs\u00d5 ferocity. One summer day, the neighbor entered the man\u00d5s fenced-in yard to retrieve a snow shovel that the man had borrowed during the past winter. The neighbor was attacked by one of the dogs and was severely injured. In a suit against the man, is the neighbor likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor knew that the man had dan-gerous dogs in the yard.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man\u00d5s property.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the pur-pose of retrieving the shovel.\nD. Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

An invitee is someone who has been invited to the premises by the owner or occupant, while an unauthorized visitor is someone who has not been invited and enters without permission.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving a snow shovel. The neighbor knew about the man's dogs and was aware of the danger they posed. Therefore, the neighbor's entry into the man's fenced-in yard was not an unauthorized visit but rather an invitee visit.\n\nGiven that the neighbor was an invitee, the man is not liable for the neighbor's injury. The neighbor's injury was a result of the dog's attack, not the man's negligence or the man's actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving the shovel."
