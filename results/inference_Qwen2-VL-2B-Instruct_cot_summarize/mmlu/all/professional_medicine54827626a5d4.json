The average pulse for the last 2 minutes of the session is 175/min. During the last minute of exercise, various measurements are taken. Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased?\n\nA. Pulse pressure\nB. Stroke volume\nC. Systolic blood pressure\nD.

                    "text": "To determine which of the following is most likely to be decreased during the last minute of exercise, we need to consider the physiological changes that occur during exercise and the factors that affect pulse pressure, stroke volume, systolic blood pressure, and total peripheral resistance.\n\n1. **Pulse Pressure**: Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. It is generally not significantly affected by the last minute of exercise, as the heart rate and blood pressure are relatively stable during exercise.\n\n2. **Stroke Volume**: Stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one heartbeat. During exercise, stroke volume increases due to an increase in heart rate and blood flow to the muscles. Therefore, stroke volume is likely to increase during the last minute of exercise.\n\n3. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure reading in the heart's contraction phase. During exercise, systolic blood pressure generally increases due to the increased heart rate and blood flow to the muscles. Therefore, systolic blood pressure is likely to increase during the last minute of exercise.\n\n4. **Total Peripheral Resistance**: Total peripheral resistance is the resistance to blood flow in the peripheral vessels. It is generally not significantly affected by the last minute of exercise, as the heart rate and blood pressure are relatively stable during exercise.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely answer is:\n\n**C. Systolic blood pressure**"
