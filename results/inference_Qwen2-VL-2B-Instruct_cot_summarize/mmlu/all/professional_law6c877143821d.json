However, it can be admissible if it is offered to show the truth of a matter of fact.\n\n2. **Prejudicial Nature**: Prejudicial testimony is testimony that is likely to cause the trier of fact to form an opinion about the truth of the matter asserted, which can influence the verdict.\n\nGiven the context, the jail employee's testimony is not hearsay because it is not based on the declarant's personal knowledge or direct observation. Instead, it is based on the declarant's recollection of events that occurred in the past.\n\nThe jail employee's testimony is also not prejudicial because it does not suggest an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence. Instead, it provides a direct observation of the defendant's behavior in the past.\n\nTherefore, the jail employee's testimony is admissible.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. Yes, to corroborate the truthfulness of the victim."
