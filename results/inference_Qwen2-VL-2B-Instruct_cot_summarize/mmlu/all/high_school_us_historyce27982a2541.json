The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nWhich of the following groups would have most likely supported the scenario described in this passage?\n\nA.

National Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nThe passage describes the transformation of women's roles and behaviors in the context of economic necessity, specifically the shift from domestic to public eating habits and the creation of the restaurant business. This scenario is most aligned with the goals and interests of the National Woman Suffrage Association, which was formed to advocate for women's right to vote and was concerned with the social and economic changes that would enable women to participate more fully in society."
