Subsequently, the jury returns a verdict for Plaintiff. The day after the jury returns its verdict, the court enters judgment for Plaintiff. One week later, Defendant moves to set aside the verdict and have judgment entered in accordance with its motion for directed verdict. In the motion, Defendant raises arguments that were not raised at trial. Plaintiff's counsel objects to the court even hearing the motion to set aside the verdict. Should the court consider the motion?\n\nA. Yes, because Defendant has raised new grounds.\nB. Yes, because Defendant had ten days after the jury returned its verdict within which to move to set aside the verdict.\nC. No, because the court denied the motion for directed verdict rather than reserving ruling.\nD. No, because the court entered final judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed.\n"

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Motion for Directed Verdict**: The court denied the motion for directed verdict after much argument, indicating that the court had already ruled on the motion.\n2. **Motion to Set Aside Verdict**: The defendant raised arguments that were not raised at trial, which suggests that the defendant had new grounds for challenging the verdict.\n3. **Court's Decision**: The court entered judgment for Plaintiff after the jury returned its verdict, indicating that the court had already made its final ruling.\n4. **Timing of Motion**: The defendant moved to set aside the verdict one week after the jury returned its verdict, which is within the ten-day period allowed by law for a motion to set aside a verdict.\n\nGiven these points, the court should consider the defendant's motion to set aside the verdict because the defendant has raised new grounds that were not considered during the trial. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, because Defendant has raised new grounds.**"
