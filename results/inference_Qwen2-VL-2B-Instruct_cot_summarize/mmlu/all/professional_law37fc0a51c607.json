An artist who specialized in making delicate glass sculptures had a studio two blocks away from the laboratory's plant. Late one evening, there was an explosion at the laboratory's plant. The force of the explosion caused the artist's studio to be shaken, which resulted in the destruction of valuable artwork in the studio. The artist now asserts a tort action against the laboratory to recover damages. Which of the following, if established, would furnish the laboratory with its best possible defense?\n\nA. The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.\nB. The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.\nC. The explosion was caused when lightning (an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm.\nD. The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.\n"

The laboratory manufactures nitroglycerin, which is a heavy, oily, explosive, and poisonous liquid used in making dynamite. The explosion caused by the laboratory's plant led to the destruction of valuable artwork in the artist's studio.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.**\n   - This option suggests that the laboratory took all necessary precautions and did not cause the explosion. However, it does not address the damage caused to the artist's studio and the artwork. The explosion caused significant damage, and the laboratory's negligence could be inferred from the explosion itself.\n\nB. **The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.**\n   - This option indicates that the nitroglycerin is used in a specific, regulated manner, which might imply that the laboratory is following strict safety protocols. However, it does not address the damage caused to the artist's studio and the artwork.\n\nC. **The explosion was caused when lightning (an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm.**\n   - This option suggests that the explosion was caused by an external event (lightning) rather than the laboratory's negligence. Lightning is an act of God, and the laboratory cannot be held responsible for such an event. This option does not provide a defense for the laboratory.\n\nD. **The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.**\n   - This option suggests that the damage to the artist's studio and artwork was caused by the abnormal fragility of the artist's work. If the laboratory's negligence was the cause of the explosion, then the abnormal fragility of the artwork would not have been a factor. This option provides a defense by suggesting that the damage was caused by the laboratory's negligence rather than the abnormal fragility of the artwork.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis, the best possible defense for the laboratory would be:\n\n**D. The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the cause of the damage and suggests that the laboratory's negligence was the primary cause of the explosion, thereby providing a defense against the artist's tort action."
