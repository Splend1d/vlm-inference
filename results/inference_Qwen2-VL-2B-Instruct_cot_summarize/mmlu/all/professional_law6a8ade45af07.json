However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter \u0080\u0094buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. As part of their agreement, the farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. After the foreclosure sale was finalized, the buyer brought suit claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract, formerly owned by the farmer. In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will\n\nA. lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.\nB. lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\nC. win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.\nD. win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to the buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. This deed was executed after the father's death and before the mortgage was secured.\n\n2. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. This means that the mortgage was secured against the entire 100-acre tract, not just the five acres that the farmer owned.\n\n3. The farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. This means that the farmer had title to those five acres before the daughter executed the warranty deed.\n\n4. The daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. This means that the farmer had title to the five-acre tract before the daughter executed the warranty deed.\n\n5. The farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. This means that the farmer had title to the five-acre tract before the daughter executed the warranty deed.\n\n6. The buyer executed and delivered a mortgage instrument securing the purchase price of $100,000. This means that the buyer had title to the five-acre tract before the mortgage was secured.\n\n7. The buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. This means that the buyer had title to the tract before the foreclosure sale.\n\n8. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. This means that the buyer had title to the tract before the foreclosure sale.\n\nTherefore, the farmer had title to the five-acre tract before the daughter executed the warranty deed, and the buyer had title to the tract before the mortgage was secured. The daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer. Therefore, the buyer will lose the title to the five-acre tract."
