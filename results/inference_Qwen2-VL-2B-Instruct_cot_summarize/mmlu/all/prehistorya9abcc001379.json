Caral was a large city with a population of over 100,000 people, and it was located in the Amazon basin. The city was built on a large island and was surrounded by canals that allowed for the irrigation of the surrounding land. This allowed the city to grow and thrive, and it became a major center of trade and commerce in the region."
