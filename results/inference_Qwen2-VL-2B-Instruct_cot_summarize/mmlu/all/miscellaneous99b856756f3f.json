This means that for every dollar Carmen spends on good X, she gets 5 units of utility, while for every dollar spent on good Y, she gets 10 units of utility.\n\nSince the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good Y is higher than that of good X, Carmen should allocate her income more towards good Y. This is because the higher marginal utility of good Y will allow her to achieve a higher level of utility with a smaller increase in her income.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. buy fewer units of X and more units of Y"
