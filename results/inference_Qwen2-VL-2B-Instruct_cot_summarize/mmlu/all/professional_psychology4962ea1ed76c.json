Ratio Data is scaled and at equal distances but no absolute zero.\n\nRatio data is a type of data that is measured on a scale that includes both a zero point and a meaningful difference between values. It is used to measure quantities that can be compared, such as lengths, weights, or times. Ratio data is often used in scientific research and statistical analysis, as it allows for the calculation of ratios and proportions."
