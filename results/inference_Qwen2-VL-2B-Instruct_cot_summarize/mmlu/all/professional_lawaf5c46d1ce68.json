When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent.

The woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read: \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\"\n2. The advertisement stated that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building.\n3. The remaining rented units were one to an African American man and one to a Pacific Islander woman.\n\nGiven these facts, we need to evaluate each option:\n\nA. The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The Fair Housing Act does not specifically address the issue of refusing to rent based on race or gender. It focuses on preventing discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability.\n\nB. The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The Fair Housing Act does not absolve landlords from liability for discrimination. The act aims to prevent discrimination, not to absolve landlords from liability.\n\nC. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The advertisement clearly states that she prefers to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, which could be seen as a preference based on race or gender. This preference could be seen as a violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nD. Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The Fair Housing Act does not specifically prohibit landlords from stating preferences based on race or gender. The act focuses on preventing discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate statement is:\n\nC. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\n\nFinal answer: C."
