However, since the region is bounded by the y-axis, we can also use the method of cylindrical shells.\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a solid of revolution generated by rotating a function \\(f(x)\\) around the y-axis from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = b\\) is given by the integral:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 dx\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(f(x) = e^x\\) and the region is bounded by \\(y = 2\\), so we have:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{0}^{2} (e^x)^2 dx\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{0}^{2} e^{2x} dx\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} e^{2x} \\right]_{0}^{2}\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{2} e^{4} - \\frac{1}{2} e^{0} \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{2} e^{4} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = \\frac{\\pi}{2} (e^{4} - 1)\\]\n\n\\[V \\approx 0.296\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.296."
