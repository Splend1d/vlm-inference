                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of fat metabolism after consuming a meal. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Consumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA concentrations.\n- This is correct. After consuming a meal, lipase activity within adipose tissue is suppressed, leading to a decrease in NEFA (neutral fatty acids) concentrations in the plasma.\n\nB. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption.\n- This is incorrect. Lipoprotein lipase is not activated by insulin; it is activated by triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, which are released from adipose tissue during the postprandial period.\n\nC. During the postprandial period the VLDL synthesis pathway is suppressed in favour of hydrolysis of chylomicrons.\n- This is incorrect. During the postprandial period, VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) synthesis is increased, not suppressed. Chylomicrons are hydrolyzed during the postprandial period, not synthesized.\n\nD. All options given are correct.\n- This is incorrect. Option A is correct, but options B and C are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Consumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA concentrations."
