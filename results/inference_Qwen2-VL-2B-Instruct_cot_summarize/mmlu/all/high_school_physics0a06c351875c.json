The cylinder reaches the base of the incline first.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Sphere**: The sphere has the smallest radius among the three objects. Since the incline is short, the sphere will slide down the incline more quickly than the other two objects. The sphere will reach the base of the incline first due to its smaller radius.\n\n2. **Cube**: The cube has the largest radius among the three objects. The cube will slide down the incline more slowly than the sphere. The cube will reach the base of the incline later than the sphere.\n\n3. **Cylinder**: The cylinder has an intermediate radius. The cylinder will slide down the incline between the sphere and the cube. It will reach the base of the incline between the sphere and the cube, but not as quickly as the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the cylinder reaches the base of the incline first."
