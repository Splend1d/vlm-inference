This can be rephrased as:\n- Pablo will go to the store if his brother drives him and pays for the gas.\n- Pablo will go to the store only if his brother drives him and pays for the gas.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (P \u2261 D) \u2261 G\n- This option suggests that Pablo will go to the store if and only if his brother drives him and pays for the gas. This is not the correct representation of the sentence.\n\nB. (D \u2022 G) \u2283 P\n- This option suggests that if his brother drives him and pays for the gas, then Pablo will go to the store. This is not the correct representation of the sentence.\n\nC. P \u2283 (D \u2022 G)\n- This option suggests that Pablo will go to the store if his brother drives him and pays for the gas. This is not the correct representation of the sentence.\n\nD. P \u2261 (D \u2022 G)\n- This option suggests that Pablo will go to the store if his brother drives him and pays for the gas.
