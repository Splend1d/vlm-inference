The holding current of a SCR is the current that must flow through the SCR to maintain its conducting state after the latching current has been removed.\n\nThe holding current of a SCR is typically much higher than the latching current. For example, a 20 mA SCR may have a holding current of 60 mA or more.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 60 mA."
