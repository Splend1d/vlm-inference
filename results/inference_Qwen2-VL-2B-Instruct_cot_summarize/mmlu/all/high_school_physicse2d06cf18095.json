                    "text": "To find the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun, we can use the information that Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year. This means that Mercury completes one orbit in about 243 Earth years.\n\nGiven that 1 AU (astronomical unit) is the distance from the Earth to the sun, we can calculate the distance between Mercury and the sun as follows:\n\n1. First, we find the distance Mercury travels in one Earth year:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance in one Earth year} = 1 \\text{ AU} = 1 \\times 14960000 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance in one Earth year} = 14960000 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we find the distance Mercury travels in one orbit:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance in one orbit} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 14960000 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance in one orbit} = 29920000 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, we find the distance between Mercury and the sun:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\text{Distance in one orbit} - \\text{Distance in one Earth year}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = 29920000 \\text{ km} - 14960000 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = 15060000 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n4. Convert the distance to astronomical units:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000 \\text{ km}}{1 \\text{ AU}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ AU}}{14960000 \\text{ km}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times 1 \\text{ AU}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance between Mercury and the sun} = \\frac{15060000}{14960000} \\times "
