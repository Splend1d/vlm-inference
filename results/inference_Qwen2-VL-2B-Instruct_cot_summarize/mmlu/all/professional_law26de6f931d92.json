The neighbor took it and returned with a bank check for the full amount, demanding that the deed be tendered. The property owner then decided that the terms were not reasonable and he returned the money and refused to tender a deed. Neighbor sued for specific performance. The property owner defended on the basis that the neighbor did not accept the agreement's terms and did not sign the document. Neighbor sued for specific performance of the transaction. Is the court likely to rule in favor of the neighbor?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor did not expressly state that he accepted the agreement.\nB. No, because the neighbor had to put his signature on the document to make it a binding contract.\nC. Yes, because neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\nD. Yes, because the property owner created a binding contract when he prepared an agreement containing the agreed terms.\n"

The neighbor's conduct of tendering the full amount of the sale price, which is equivalent to accepting the terms of the agreement, constitutes a manifestation of assent. This is a common legal principle known as the \"manifestation of assent\" doctrine, which holds that a party's conduct can be considered as an acceptance of the terms of a contract even if the party did not explicitly state acceptance. \n\nIn this scenario, the neighbor's act of tendering the full amount of the sale price is a clear indication that the property owner's agreement was accepted by the neighbor. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the neighbor has manifested his assent and that the contract has been formed, thereby justifying specific performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed."
