Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?\n\nA. The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.\nB. The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\nC. The resident will win because all public rights cannot be limited to those who can afford them.\nD. The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\n\nThis reasoning is based on the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees equal protection under the law, does not apply to private rights or privileges that are not considered fundamental or basic. In this case, the hotel's privileges, such as the sale of alcoholic beverages, are not considered fundamental rights or privileges that are protected by the equal protection clause. Therefore, the resident cannot claim that the hotel's fees discriminate against the poor and violate the equal protection clause."
