                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the normal distribution and the z-score formula. The z-score formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value of the variable we are interested in, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the distribution, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (\\( \\mu \\)) = 200 ohms\n- Standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)) = 5 ohms\n- Value of the variable (\\( X \\)) = 194 ohms\n\nWe want to find the probability that the resistance is greater than 188 ohms. We can use the z-score formula to find the corresponding z-score for 188 ohms:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{188 - 200}{5} = \\frac{-12}{5} = -2.4 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than -2.4. This is the area to the right of z = -2.4 under the standard normal distribution curve. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this probability.\n\nLooking up -2.4 in the standard normal distribution table, we find the probability to be approximately 0.0128.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the resistance is greater than 188 ohms is approximately 0.128, which corresponds to option B."
