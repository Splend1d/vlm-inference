Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.\n\nThe best evidence for the older age of rocks on the Moon's surface compared to those on Earth's surface is the radioactive dating of lunar samples. This method involves measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes in the rocks, which can provide a direct measure of the age of the rock. The Moon's surface has more impact craters than the Earth's surface, which is consistent with the idea that the Moon has been subjected to more impacts over its history. However, the fact that the Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface does not necessarily indicate that the Moon is older than the Earth."
