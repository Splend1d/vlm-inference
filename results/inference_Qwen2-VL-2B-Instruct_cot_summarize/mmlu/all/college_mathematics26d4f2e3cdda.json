The order of a group is the number of elements in the group, and for a group of order n, the possible orders of subgroups are 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1.\n\nFor a group of order n to have only one subgroup of a specific order, the group must be cyclic. This means that the group can be generated by a single element. For a group of order n to be cyclic, it must be of the form n = 2^k * m, where m is a prime number.\n\nThe only integers n that satisfy this condition are 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. These are the only integers less than or equal to 11 that can be expressed as 2^k * m, where m is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. For 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 only."
