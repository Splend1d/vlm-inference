The surgeon moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion and set discovery cutoff and trial dates. The surgeon has appealed the denial of the motion. Should the appellate court hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\nB. No, because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final.\nC. Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\nD. Yes, because the surgeon's personal- jurisdiction challenge raises a constitutional question.\n"

No, because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final.\n\nThe appellate court does not have jurisdiction to hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final. The district court's decision is final because it is a judgment of the district court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. The appellate court cannot review the district court's decision on jurisdiction unless it is an appeal from a final judgment of the district court. Therefore, the surgeon's appeal is not a final judgment of the district court, and the appellate court does not have jurisdiction to hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal."
