Many American lives were lost, and American ships were reported torpedoed on the high seas.\n4. The President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, addressed the nation, stating that the attack was a surprise and that the United States was at peace with Japan.\n5. The President directed that all measures be taken for defense.\n\nGiven these points, the economic consequences of the declaration of war can be understood as follows:\n\n- The attack on Pearl Harbor led to significant damage to American naval and military forces, which could have had a negative impact on trade and economic stability.\n- The loss of many lives and the damage to American ships could have led to economic difficulties, particularly in the short term.\n- The President's directive to take all necessary measures for defense suggests that the United States was prepared to face the consequences of the attack, which could have had a deterrent effect on potential economic repercussions.\n\nConsidering these points, the best statement that characterizes the economic consequences of the declaration of war is:\n\nC. Cold War tensions isolated the economies of both the Soviet Union and the United States, leading to economic struggle for both nations.\n\nThis statement captures the economic struggle and isolation that followed the declaration of war, which was a significant factor in the Cold War tensions."
