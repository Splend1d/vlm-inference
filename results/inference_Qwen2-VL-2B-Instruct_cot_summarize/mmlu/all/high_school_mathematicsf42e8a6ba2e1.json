                    "text": " The graph of $f(x)$ is shifted $2$ units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of $2$. This means that for any $x$ value, the $x$ value is $2x$ and the $y$ value is $2y$. So, if we have a point $(x, y)$ on the graph, the corresponding point on the new graph is $(2x, 2y)$.\n\nWe are given that $f(0) = 0.1$. This means that when $x = 0$, the corresponding point on the new graph is $(0, 0.2)$. This is because when $x = 0$, the $x$ value is $0$ and the $y$ value is $2y$, so $2y = 0.2$, and $y = 0.1$.\n\nNow, we want to find $f(10)$. We can use the fact that the graph of $f(x)$ is shifted $2$ units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of $2$. This means that when $x = 10$, the corresponding point on the new graph is $(2(10) - 2, 2(10)) = (18, 20)$.\n\nSo, $f(10) = 20$. The answer is: $D$."
