The dealer lived approximately two miles from the theater. After picking up the marijuana, the classmate then drove to the concert. As he was driving to the concert, the classmate smoked two marijuana cigarettes so that he could be \"high\" for the show. While the car was parked outside the theater, through no fault of the classmate, it was struck by another car and damaged. Repairs will cost $750. The driver of the vehicle that struck the student's car fled the scene and cannot be identified.

The cost of repairing the car because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Dominion and Control**: The car was lent to the classmate, and the classmate had the right to use it for the purpose of attending the concert. The classmate's use of the car was within the scope of his dominion and control.\n\n2. **Purpose of Use**: The classmate used the car for the purpose of attending the concert, which was the intended use of the car. The car was not used for any other purpose.\n\n3. **Dominion and Control**: The classmate had the right to use the car for the purpose of attending the concert, and he used it for that purpose. The car was not used for any other purpose, so the classmate was not negligent in causing the car's damage.\n\n4. **Recovery**: The classmate is not liable for the damage to the car because the car was used for the purpose for which it was lent, and the use was within the scope of the classmate's dominion and control.\n\nTherefore, the classmate will not recover anything from the student for the damage to the car."
