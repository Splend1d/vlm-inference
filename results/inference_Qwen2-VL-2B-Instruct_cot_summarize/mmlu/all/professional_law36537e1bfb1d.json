Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.\nB. No, because the offer was not accepted \u0080\u0094 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\nC. Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\nD. No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.\n"

Therefore, the oral agreement and the check are sufficient to establish a contract.\n   - **Option B: No, because the offer was not accepted \u0080\u0094 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.**\n     - The seller called the deal off before the offer was accepted. This means the offer was not accepted, and therefore, the oral agreement and the check are not enforceable.\n   - **Option C: Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.**\n     - The oral agreement and the written offer are sufficient to establish a contract. The check for the down payment is evidence of consideration.\n   - **Option D: No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.**\n     - Specific performance is not applicable in a residential real estate transaction. However, the oral agreement, written offer, and check are sufficient to establish a contract.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.**\n\nTherefore, the purchaser is likely to prevail in the lawsuit."
