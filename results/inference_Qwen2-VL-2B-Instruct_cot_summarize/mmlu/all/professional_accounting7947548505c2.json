By adopting the fixed asset module, the committee can leverage the existing system's strengths while addressing any gaps or inefficiencies in the current process. This approach ensures that the new system is not only functional but also integrates seamlessly with the existing system, potentially reducing the need for a stand-alone fixed asset program."
