Fearful that the information about his herpes condition will become available, he seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid the government from requiring him to take a physical examination.

The law does not involve commerce or the raising and support of an army and navy, nor does it raise any specific constitutional issue related to the dormant commerce clause."
