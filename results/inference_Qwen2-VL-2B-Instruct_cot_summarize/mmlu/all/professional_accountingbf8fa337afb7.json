Finally, we'll divide the profit by the sales price per unit to find the number of units sold.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the phones sold:**\n\nSpark buys each cordless phone for $125 and sells them for $200. The cost per unit is $200 - $125 = $75.\n\n2. **Calculate the total sales revenue:**\n\nThe sales price per unit is $200, and Spark sells 100 units (since the profit is 10% of sales, and the desired profit is $25 per unit sold, so the total profit is 10% of $200, which is $20, and the profit per unit is $20 / 100 = $200 / 100 = $2). Therefore, the total sales revenue is $200 * 100 = $20,000.\n\n3. **Calculate the profit:**\n\nThe profit per unit is $25, and Spark sells 100 units, so the total profit is $25 * 100 = $2500.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of units sold:**\n\nThe total cost of the phones sold is $75 * 100 = $7500. To find the number of units sold, we divide the total cost by the cost per unit: $7500 / $75 = 100 units.\n\nTherefore, Spark must sell 100 units to achieve a 10% profit.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 100**."
