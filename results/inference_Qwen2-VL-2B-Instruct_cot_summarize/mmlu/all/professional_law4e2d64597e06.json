                    "text": "On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. If the mother asserts a wrongful death action against the doctor, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.\nB. prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.\nC. not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.\nD. not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.\n"

Not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is that the hospital's rule states that all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. However, the doctor, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. This lack of adherence to the hospital's rule is a significant factor in the death of the father. The hospital's rule is designed to ensure that the correct blood is administered to the patient, and the doctor's failure to follow this rule is a breach of the hospital's policy and could be considered negligence or malpractice. Therefore, the mother may have a strong case for wrongful death if she can prove that the hospital's rule was violated and that the doctor's actions were a contributing factor to the father's death."
