Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the main character's actions in Scenario 1 (giving her 2 slaps before school) are considered morally wrong. Slapping someone is generally considered a form of physical harm and is not considered a justifiable response to a minor offense. In Scenario 2, peeing in the public urinal is also considered morally wrong, as it is considered a public act of defecation and is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate in public settings."
