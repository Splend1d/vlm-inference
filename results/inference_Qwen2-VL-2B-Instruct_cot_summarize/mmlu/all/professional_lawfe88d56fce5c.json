She was able to buy the house for a very good price because it was located directly across the street from a fraternity house known for its frequent late-night parties. The buyer knew of the fraternity's reputation before she bought the house. The reputation was well deserved, and the buyer found the noise from the parties extremely unpleasant and disruptive. The buyer has asked an attorney for legal advice regarding a possible nuisance claim against the fraternity. Which of the following responses would best express the applicable law?\n\nA. \"You have no nuisance claim, because the fraternity members have the right to use their property as they please.\"\nB. \"You have no nuisance claim, because you came to the nuisance.\"\nC. \"You might have a nuisance claim, but the fact that you bought the house fully aware of the fraternity's habitual late-night activities will count against your claim and could help defeat it.\"\nD. \"You will be able to recover damages in a nuisance action, because the late-night activities of the fraternity members violate your right to the quiet enjoyment of your property.\"\n"

It also suggests that the buyer's awareness of the fraternity's activities could potentially weaken the case for a nuisance claim."
