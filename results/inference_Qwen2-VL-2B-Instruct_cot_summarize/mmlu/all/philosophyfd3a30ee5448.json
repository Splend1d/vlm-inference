Aristotle's statement suggests that the essence or form of a thing is not independent of the individuals that exist in the world. If all members of a species were destroyed, the essence or form of that species would also be destroyed.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"would likewise be destroyed.\"\n- This option suggests that if all members of a species were destroyed, the essence or form of that species would also be destroyed. This aligns with Aristotle's statement.\n\nB. \"would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\"\n- This option implies that the essence or form would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember it. However, Aristotle's statement does not specify that the essence or form would be destroyed if there were no one around to remember it. It only states that the essence or form is dependent on individuals.\n\nC. \"would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\"\n- This option suggests that the essence or form would continue existing in some other realm of being. However, Aristotle's statement does not provide information about the nature of this other realm.\n\nD. \"would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.\"\n- This option suggests that the essence or form would not be destroyed because there were no universal essences or natures of things. However, Aristotle's statement does not provide information about the nature of these universal essences or natures.\n\nGiven Aristotle's statement, the correct answer is:\n\nA. would likewise be destroyed."
