The agent asked the addict to obtain heroin for him, but the addict refused. For several weeks the agent continued to plead with and beg the addict to get him drugs; finally, the addict gave in to the pressure and got the drugs. The police promptly arrested him. At trial, the defendant raised the defense of government entrapment. Will the trial court likely dismiss the case based on that argument?\n\nA. Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\nB. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.\nC. No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.\nD. Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.\n"

In this scenario, the defendant's refusal to obtain drugs from the government agent is a key element of the defense.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.**\n   - This option suggests that the government's actions led the defendant to commit the crime. However, the key issue here is whether the defendant's refusal to obtain drugs was a result of the government's entrapment or if it was a result of the addict's own predisposition to want to obtain drugs.\n\nB. **No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.**\n   - This option suggests that the addict's predisposition to want to obtain drugs was the reason for his actions, not the government's entrapment. This is not the case here, as the addict's refusal to obtain drugs was a result of the government's entrapment.\n\nC. **No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.**\n   - This option suggests that the addict's refusal was a result of his own decision, not the government's entrapment. This is also not the case here, as the addict's refusal was a result of the government's entrapment.\n\nD. **Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.**\n   - This option suggests that the government's entrapment occurred when the agent asked a second time, which is a common rule in entrapment cases. However, the key issue here is whether the addict's refusal was a result of the government's entrapment or if it was a result of his own predisposition.\n\nGiven the context and the key elements of the defense, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
