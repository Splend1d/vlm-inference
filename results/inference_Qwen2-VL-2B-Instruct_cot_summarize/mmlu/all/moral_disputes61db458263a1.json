However, it does not directly address the claim about increased availability leading to increased use.\n\nB. **The percentage of physicians who use psychoactive drugs is much higher than the general population.**\n   - This statement indicates that the availability of a drug (psychoactive drugs) is higher among physicians compared to the general population. However, it does not directly address the claim about increased availability leading to increased use.\n\nC. **Alcohol abuse declines when the law restricts the times it can be legally sold.**\n   - This statement suggests that availability (legal selling times) affects alcohol use. However, it does not directly address the claim about increased availability leading to increased use.\n\nD. **All of the above.**\n   - This option encompasses both A and B, suggesting that both increased availability and higher availability among physicians contribute to increased use of psychoactive drugs.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best supports the claim that increased availability of a drug leads to increased use of that drug is:\n\n**D. All of the above.**"
