Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting.\n\nVitamin D deficiency is often found in people who are well-nourished, which can occur due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Dietary Sources**: Most vitamin D in the body comes from the diet, particularly from foods like fatty fish, fortified foods, and supplements. However, the amount of vitamin D in these foods can vary depending on factors like the soil in which they were grown, which can affect their vitamin D content.\n\n2. **Absorption**: The body's ability to absorb vitamin D from the diet is influenced by factors like the amount of vitamin D in the food, the presence of certain nutrients that can interfere with absorption, and the individual's overall nutritional status.\n\n3. **Absorption and Utilization**: The body's ability to absorb and utilize vitamin D is also influenced by factors like the presence of certain nutrients that can interfere with absorption, such as iron, calcium, and magnesium.\n\n4. **Other Nutrients**: Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D, as the body may need more vitamin D to support growth and development. This can lead to a higher demand for vitamin D, even if the individual's overall diet is well-balanced.\n\nTherefore, the main reason vitamin D deficiency can often be found in an otherwise well-nourished person is because diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D, making it limiting."
