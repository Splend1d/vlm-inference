Canalization.\n\nCanalization refers to the idea that certain physical traits or behaviors develop in a specific sequence or order, often influenced by genetic factors, but can also be influenced by environmental factors. This concept is particularly relevant in developmental psychology, where it helps explain why certain physical changes, such as the development of certain motor skills or cognitive abilities, occur in a specific order and at a specific age."
