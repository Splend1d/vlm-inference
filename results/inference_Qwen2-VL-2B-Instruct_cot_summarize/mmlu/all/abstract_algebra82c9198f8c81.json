If a polynomial has a root in the field R, then R is a splitting field of that polynomial over Q.\n\nStatement 2: There is a field with 60 elements.\n- This statement is false. The smallest field with 60 elements is the 60-element field of 2, denoted as \\( \\mathbb{F}_2 \\). However, there are no other fields with 60 elements. The smallest field with 60 elements is \\( \\mathbb{F}_2 \\), which is a finite field with two elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
