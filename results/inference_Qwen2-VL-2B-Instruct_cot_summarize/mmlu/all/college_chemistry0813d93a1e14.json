Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism if the ligands are not identical, as long as they are achiral.\n\nB. **Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism, as long as the ligands are achiral.\n\nC. **Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.**\n   - This statement is incorrect.
