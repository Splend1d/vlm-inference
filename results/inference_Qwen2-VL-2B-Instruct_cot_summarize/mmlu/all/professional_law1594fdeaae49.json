Immediately after the accident, the man ran over to the woman and said, \"I know I was driving fast, but you weren't paying attention where you were walking. Anyhow, I'm willing to pay all your medical expenses. \"At trial, the woman calls an eyewitness to the accident. The eyewitness proposes to testify that he heard the man tell the woman, \"I know I was driving fast. \" The man's attorney objects. If the eyewitness's testimony is admitted, it will most likely be because the proffered evidence is\n\nA. admissible as an opinion.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. admissible as a present sense impression.\nD. admissible as a declaration against interest.\n"

It is not an admission or a declaration against interest, and it is not admissible as an opinion. Therefore, the woman's eyewitness testimony that the man told her he was driving fast would be admissible as a present sense impression."
