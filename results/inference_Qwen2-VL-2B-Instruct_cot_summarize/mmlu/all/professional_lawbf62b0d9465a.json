The airline that owned and operated the airplane is incorporated and has its maintenance facilities and principal place of business in State C. One day before the statute of limitations on their claims would have run, the estates of the pilot and each of the passengers filed a wrongful death action against the airline in federal court in State A. The airline was served one week later and wants to prevent the State A federal court from hearing the action. Which of the following motions is most likely to accomplish the airline's goal?\n\nA. A motion to dismiss the action for improper venue.\nB. A motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.\nC. A motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\nD. A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C.\n"

This would likely result in the dismissal of the action in favor of the airline."
