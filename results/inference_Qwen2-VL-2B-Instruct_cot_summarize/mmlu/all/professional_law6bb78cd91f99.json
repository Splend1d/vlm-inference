Yes, as an admission by a party opponent.\nB. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.\nC. No, because it was made while in custody and therefore is unreliable.\nD. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.\n"
