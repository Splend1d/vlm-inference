Throwing a rock at a drowning man's head is considered morally wrong because it is a violent act that can cause harm and is not justified by any moral principle. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) does not do anything clearly morally wrong. Buying computer parts and returning them after finding out they were broken is a legal and ethical action, as it is within the boundaries of the law and the company's policy."
