Rising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States.\n\nWhen a country's per capita GDP increases, it generally leads to an increase in the demand for imported goods, which can lead to a depreciation of the currency. Conversely, a decrease in the demand for imported goods can lead to an appreciation of the currency. In this case, an increase in imports from the United States would suggest a rise in demand for Chinese goods, which could lead to an appreciation of the Chinese yuan relative to the U.S. dollar. Therefore, option D is the correct choice."
