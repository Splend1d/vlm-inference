To find the total cost for $200,000, we calculate:\n\n\\[200,000 \\div 1,000 \\times 2.76 = \\$43,200\\]\n\nAdding the salary and the insurance cost together gives:\n\n\\[\\$100,000 + \\$43,200 = \\$103,200\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Johnson must include in gross income is:\n\n\\[B. \\$100,276\\]\n\nThe correct answer is B."
