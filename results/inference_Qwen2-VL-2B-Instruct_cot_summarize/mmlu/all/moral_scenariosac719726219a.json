This action is morally wrong because it is against the law to park in a handicapped spot when you are not a handicapped person. In Scenario 2, the hospital signs told them to turn off all electrical devices, but they kept their phone on. This action is not morally wrong because it is a personal choice and not against any law or moral standard."
