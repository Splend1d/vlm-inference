For example, if p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, then p + q = 1.\n\nB. p - q < 0\n- This is also possible because the difference between two probabilities can be less than 0. For example, if p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, then p - q = 0.\n\nC. p / q > 1\n- This is impossible because the ratio of two probabilities cannot be greater than 1. For example, if p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, then p / q = 1, which is not greater than 1.\n\nD. E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive\n- This is possible because if E and F are independent and mutually exclusive, then the probability of both events occurring is zero. For example, if E and F are independent, then p(E \u2229 F) = p(E) * p(F) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the option that is impossible is:\n\nC. p / q > 1"
