The central carbon atom has two sp2 hybrid orbitals, which are used to form two single bonds with the oxygen atoms.\n\n2. **CO32-**: The Lewis structure of CO32- shows one carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. The central carbon atom has three sp2 hybrid orbitals, which are used to form three single bonds with the oxygen atoms.\n\n3. **NO2-**: The Lewis structure of NO2- shows one nitrogen atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. The central nitrogen atom has three sp2 hybrid orbitals, which are used to form three single bonds with the oxygen atoms.\n\n4. **NO3-**: The Lewis structure of NO3- shows one nitrogen atom bonded to four oxygen atoms. The central nitrogen atom has three sp2 hybrid orbitals, which are used to form three single bonds with the oxygen atoms.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that:\n\n- CO2 and CO32- exhibit sp2 hybridization around the central atom.\n- NO2- and NO3- also exhibit sp2 hybridization around the central atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. CO2 and CO32-"
