It involves a violation of trust and a lack of compassion towards the children's health needs.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the debater that the character likes wanted to win, so the character assigned her judges that were randomly chosen. This action does not involve any moral wrongdoing. It is a decision made based on the character's personal preference and does not violate any moral principles."
