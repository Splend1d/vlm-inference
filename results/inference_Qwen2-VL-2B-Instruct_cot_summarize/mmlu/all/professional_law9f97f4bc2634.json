The contract contained a provision wherein the supermarket promised to purchase \"as many oranges as required, but at a minimum 100 bushels per month at a price of $20 per bushel for the next year. \" The agreement also provided that any modifications must be in writing. On February 1, the produce company shipped the supermarket 70 bushels of oranges, which were accepted and paid for. On March 1, the produce company tendered 80 bushels of oranges, which the supermarket accepted and paid for. On April 1, the produce company delivered 100 bushels of oranges to the supermarket. This shipment was accepted and also was promptly paid for. On April 2, the manager of the supermarket became concerned because a Florida drought had resulted in a sharp increase in the price of oranges. Consequently, the manager consulted the supermarket's attorney, who advised him to demand adequate assurances that the produce company would perform its obligations under the terms of the contract. Heeding the attorney's advice, the manager sent a letter on April 3 to the produce company, expressing his concern and requesting an adequate assurance of due performance for the balance of the contract.

Therefore, the supermarket cannot cancel the contract on May 1 without violating the contract terms.\n\n- **Option B**: \"Wait until the May 1 shipment; if it doesn't comply, demand adequate assurances, and not obtaining them, then sue for damages.\"\n  - This option is feasible because the supermarket has already received shipments of 70, 80, and 100 bushels, which means it has already met the minimum requirement of 100 bushels per month. The supermarket can demand adequate assurances for the balance of the contract, which is April 1 to April 2, and if the produce company does not provide them, it can sue for damages.\n\n- **Option C**: \"Wait until the end of the contract and then sue for damages.\"\n  - This option is not feasible because the contract specifies that the supermarket will purchase \"as many oranges as required, but at a minimum 100 bushels per month at a price of $20 per bushel for the next year.\" The supermarket has already received shipments of 70, 80, and 100 bushels, which means it has already met the minimum requirement of 100 bushels per month. Therefore, the supermarket cannot wait until the end of the contract and then sue for damages.\n\n- **Option D**: \"Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\"\n  - This option is not feasible because the contract specifies that the supermarket will purchase \"as many oranges as required, but at a minimum 100 bushels per month at a price of $20 per bushel for the next year.\" The supermarket has already received shipments of 70, 80, and 100 bushels, which means it has already met the minimum requirement of 100 bushels per month.

Wait until the May 1 shipment; if it doesn't comply, demand adequate assurances, and not obtaining them, then sue for damages.**"
