(E \u2283 F) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n- This option suggests that if England's importing beef is sufficient for France's subsidizing agriculture, then France's subsidizing agriculture is sufficient for England's importing beef. This does not directly capture the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\n- This option suggests that if France's subsidizing agriculture is sufficient for England's importing beef, then England's importing beef is sufficient for France's subsidizing agriculture. Similarly, if China's promoting human rights is necessary for South Africa's supplying diamonds, then South Africa's supplying diamonds is necessary for China's promoting human rights. This does not capture the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\n- This option suggests that if England's importing beef is sufficient for France's subsidizing agriculture, then France's subsidizing agriculture is sufficient for England's importing beef. Similarly, if China's promoting human rights is necessary for South Africa's supplying diamonds, then South Africa's supplying diamonds is necessary for China's promoting human rights. This does not capture the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n- This option suggests that if France's subsidizing agriculture is sufficient for England's importing beef, then England's importing beef is sufficient for France's subsidizing agriculture. Similarly, if China's promoting human rights is necessary for South Africa's supplying diamonds, then South Africa's supplying diamonds is necessary for China's promoting human rights. This captures the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)"
