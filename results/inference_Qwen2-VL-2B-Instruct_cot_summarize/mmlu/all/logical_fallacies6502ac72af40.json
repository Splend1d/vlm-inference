Denying the Antecedent\n\nThe argument presented is a form of logical fallacy known as \"Denying the Antecedent.\" This occurs when someone argues that something cannot be true because it is not the case that something else is true. In this case, the argument is that because not everyone is intelligent, it follows that no one should attend college. However, the premise that \"not everyone is intelligent\" is not a valid assumption, as it is not necessarily true that not everyone is intelligent. Therefore, the argument is flawed and cannot be validly supported."
