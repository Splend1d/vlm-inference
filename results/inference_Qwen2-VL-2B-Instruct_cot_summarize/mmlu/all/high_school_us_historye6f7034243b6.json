Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people\u2014these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThe Port Huron Statement, excerpted above, can most clearly be seen as an important document in which of the following movements?\n\nA.

The civil rights movement.\n\nThe Port Huron Statement is a significant document from the civil rights movement, which emerged in the 1960s in response to the racial segregation and discrimination faced by African Americans in the United States. It was written by a group of young people, including Martin Luther King Jr., in 1962, and it articulated the principles of nonviolent resistance and the belief in the power of collective action to bring about social change. The statement was a response to the growing civil rights movement and the increasing awareness of the need for racial equality and justice."
