Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something clearly morally wrong by spreading a rumor about a pandemic without verifying the facts. This is considered morally wrong because it involves spreading false information, which can cause harm to others and disrupt public trust.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something that is not clearly morally wrong. The plan to plan a quiet vacation for the mother-in-law who needs oxygen to breathe is a compassionate and thoughtful action. It shows consideration for the mother-in-law's needs and demonstrates a willingness to help others. This action is not inherently wrong, but it is not morally wrong either, as it is a positive action that benefits the mother-in-law."
