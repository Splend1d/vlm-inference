The offeree sent a notification to the offeror stating, \"We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date.\" The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. On the date of shipment, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager and told him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time, he was shipping the goods back, and to \"ignore any paperwork we sent.\" The offeror sued the offeree for breach of contract. Who will prevail?\n\nA. The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.\nB. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\nC. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\nD. The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.\n"

                    "text": "The key to determining who will prevail in this scenario involves understanding the nature of the contract and the terms of the offer and acceptance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Offer and Acceptance**: The offeror sent a notification to the offeree stating they had received the offer to sell landscaping stones per specified terms. The offeree then sent an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. This acceptance was sent after the goods were shipped.\n\n2. **The Nature of the Contract**: The contract in question is a contract for the sale of landscaping stones, which is a specific type of contract. The terms of the contract are clearly stated in the notification and the acceptance form. The contract is enforceable based on the terms agreed upon.\n\n3. **The Date of Shipment**: The goods were shipped upon receiving the notification of the acceptance. This means that the goods were shipped after the offeree accepted the terms of the offer.\n\n4. **The Offeree's Actions**: The offeree called the offeror's manager and informed him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time. This rejection of the offer was made after the goods had already been shipped.\n\nGiven these points, the offeree's actions indicate that they did not accept the terms of the offer at the time of shipment. The offeree's rejection of the offer after the goods were shipped means that the offeror did not have the right to enforce the contract based on the terms agreed upon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.**"
