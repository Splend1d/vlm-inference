Upon delivery, the buyer was surprised to find an assortment of pacific wild salmon, domestic salmon raised in captivity, and mixed east coast salmon. In prior discussions, the parties agreed on all pacific wild salmon for fulfillment of the order, and none of the other inferior types were discussed. Does the parol evidence rule apply to preclude the buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties' intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract?\n\nA. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used.\nB. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the testimony would add to or contradict the final signed writing.\nC. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply because the contract was reduced to writing.\nD. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the terms of the contract were not recorded and preserved at the time of signing the contract.\n"

In this case, the buyer's testimony regarding the types of salmon intended by the term \"quality salmon\" is relevant because it explains the intended meaning of the term in the contract.\n\nThe key point here is that the buyer's testimony is not adding to or contradicting the final signed writing but rather explaining the meaning of the term in the contract. Therefore, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude the buyer's testimony.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used."
