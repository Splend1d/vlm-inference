This approach includes measures such as minimum wage legislation, land reform, and progressive taxation. However, it does not necessarily involve increased access to education. Education is often seen as a key factor in reducing inequality and increasing economic opportunities, but it is not a direct element of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach."
