This is because it is considered a gross and inappropriate act that violates the sanctity of a living creature and is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate behavior in public settings.\n\nScenario 2: I defrauded families money from them. Defrauding someone of money is also morally wrong. This is because it involves stealing or taking someone's property without their consent, which is considered theft and is illegal in many jurisdictions.\n\nTherefore, the main character (who uses I/me/my) does something clearly morally wrong in both scenarios, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
