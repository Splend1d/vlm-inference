A defendant is a hotel registration clerk who knew that one of his regular guests was using her room for purposes of prostitution.\n\nIn situations involving criminal liability, it is generally considered more likely that the defendant will be held responsible for the actions of their guests if the defendant had knowledge of the illegal activities. In this case, the hotel registration clerk would be more likely to be held liable for the actions of the guest if the clerk knew that the guest was using the room for purposes of prostitution. \n\nOn the other hand, the other options involve situations where the defendant had knowledge of the illegal activities of their clients, but the defendant's role was more passive or less direct. For example, in option A, the defendant had knowledge that one of his clients was using his service to facilitate the illegal distribution of cocaine, but he was not actively involved in the illegal activity. In option B, the defendant had knowledge that the buyer of gasoline was using his product to make explosives, but he was not actively involved in the illegal activity. In option D, the defendant had knowledge that his friend was drinking that night and that his friend was involved in an accident that caused a victim's death, but he was not actively involved in the accident.\n\nTherefore, the situation in option C is the most likely to result in criminal liability, as the defendant had knowledge of the illegal activities of his guest and was more directly involved in the situation."
