                    "text": "An auto retailer started a marketing promotion on a new hybrid model sedan. It advertised that anyone who purchased the car in 2013 and did not get at least 50 miles per gallon average gas mileage during the first 60 days, would receive a payment of $10,000 cash from the company. Record-keeping and inspection procedures were required to assure accurate reporting by the vehicle owner. The promotion was widely publicized. A female customer purchased a hybrid model during the promotion period, followed all the rules, and recorded only 42 mpg in the first 60 days. She demanded the rebate but the company stalled for months and then stopped responding to her inquiries. Does she have a contractual right to collect the $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.\nB. No, this was merely puffing, was not an offer to contract with any particular person and was without consideration.\nC. Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\nD. No, because she did not formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before she started performing.\n"

Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Contract**: The advertisement by the auto retailer was a promotional offer, not a contract. Promotions are typically not binding contracts and do not require formal acceptance by the offeree.\n\n2. **Offer and Acceptance**: The advertisement was a promotional offer, not an offer to contract with any particular person. The female customer did not formally accept the offer by performing the terms of the offer, which is a key requirement for a contract.\n\n3. **Consideration**: The advertisement did not provide any consideration (money or other valuable consideration) for the offer to be binding. The advertisement was merely a promise without any monetary or other value attached to it.\n\n4. **Bilateral Contract**: A bilateral contract is one where both parties are involved in the contract. In this case, the advertisement was made by the retailer, and the customer was not involved in the contract.\n\nTherefore, the advertisement was not a contract, and the customer did not have a contractual right to collect the $10,000."
