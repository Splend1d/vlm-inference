The ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom to form a positive ion.\n\n1. **Carbon (C)**: The ionization energy of carbon is approximately 15.1 eV.\n2. **Nitrogen (N)**: The ionization energy of nitrogen is approximately 13.0 eV.\n3. **Neon (Ne)**: The ionization energy of neon is approximately 8.0 eV.\n4. **Sulfur (S)**: The ionization energy of sulfur is approximately 15.2 eV.\n\nThe element with the lowest ionization energy is neon (Ne), which has an ionization energy of 8.0 eV. The ionization energy of neon is three times higher than that of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but not as high as sulfur (S).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Neon"
