As a result, the buyer filed suit against the seller on January 25 for a refund of his down payment of $5,000. In his suit, the buyer will be unsuccessful and will be obliged to complete the contract if the court determines that on January 20\n\nA. the buyer held the legal title to the farm.\nB. the seller held the legal title to the farm.\nC. the buyer held the equitable title to the farm.\nD. the seller held the equitable title to the farm.\n"
