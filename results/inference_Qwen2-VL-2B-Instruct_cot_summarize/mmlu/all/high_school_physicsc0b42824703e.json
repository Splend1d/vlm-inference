Therefore, at t = 0, the position x is 0.\n\n2. **Constant Speed Between t = 0 and t = 1**: The body has a constant speed of 24 meters per second between t = 0 and t = 1. This means the body moves 24 meters in the positive x direction between t = 0 and t = 1.\n\n3. **Acceleration at t = 1**: The body is given a constant acceleration of -6 meters per second squared in the negative x direction at t = 1. This means the body moves 6 meters in the negative x direction between t = 1 and t = 11.\n\n4. **Position at t = 11**: To find the position at t = 11, we need to add the initial position (0 meters) and the distance moved in the negative x direction (6 meters) between t = 1 and t = 11.\n\n\\[ \\text{Position at t = 11} = 0 + 6 = 6 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the position of the body at t = 11 seconds is 6 meters.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 36m**."
