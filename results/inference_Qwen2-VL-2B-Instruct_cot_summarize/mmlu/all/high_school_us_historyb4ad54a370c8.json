I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nThe \"First Great Awakening\" can be seen as a direct response to which of the following?\n\nA.

Puritanism\n\nThe passage by Roger Williams, \"The Hireling Ministry,\" is a critique of the Puritanical approach to religious and political governance, particularly the idea that the civil powers of the state should be subordinate to the spiritual authority of the church. Williams argues that the Puritans' belief in the supremacy of the state over the church was a mistake, and that the civil powers should be subject to the spiritual authority of the church. This critique aligns with the broader themes of the First Great Awakening, which aimed to reform the religious and political structures of the American colonies and to promote a more egalitarian and democratic approach to governance."
