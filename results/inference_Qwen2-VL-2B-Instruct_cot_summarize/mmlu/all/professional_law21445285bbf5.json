A man's record showed four prior convictions for nonviolent crimes involving theft or bad checks, each one pertaining to property or cash in excess of $100 but not in excess of $500. On the fifth conviction, after conviction of passing a $100 bad check, the court sentenced him to life without parole under a repeat offender statute. He challenged the sentence and the statute based on the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely invalidate the sentence on these facts?\n\nA. Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\nB. Yes, because life imprisonment can never be an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life.\nC. No, because theft and passing bad checks has become a national emergency warranting tough remedial action to protect the economy, institutions and persons being victimized.\nD. No, because it is improper for the courts to attempt to interject their value judgments into a state's ostensibly reasonable legislative sentencing schemes.\n"

                    "text": "The Supreme Court's decision in this case is likely to be closely scrutinized, as it involves a state's recidivist statute and the application of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The key points to consider are the gravity of the sentence, the nature of the crime, and the possibility of parole.\n\n1. **Gravity of the Sentence**: The statute imposes a life sentence without parole for a fifth conviction of criminal theft involving goods or money of $100 or more. This is a serious offense, but it is not necessarily disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime. The crime of passing a $100 bad check is a lesser offense, and the court's sentence is based on the severity of the crime rather than the gravity of the individual conviction.\n\n2. **Nature of the Crime**: The crime of passing a $100 bad check is a lesser offense compared to the crime of theft involving goods or money. The former is a lesser offense, and the court's sentence is based on the severity of the crime rather than the gravity of the individual conviction.\n\n3. **Parole**: The statute does not explicitly prohibit parole. However, the Supreme Court has historically upheld the constitutionality of life imprisonment without parole for certain crimes, such as murder. The court's decision in this case is likely to be closely scrutinized, and the Court may consider whether the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime and whether it is an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life.\n\nGiven these points, the Court is likely to invalidate the sentence based on the gravity of the sentence, the nature of the crime, and the possibility of parole. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole."
