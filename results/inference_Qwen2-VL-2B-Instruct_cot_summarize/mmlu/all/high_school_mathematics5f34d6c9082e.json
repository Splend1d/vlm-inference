The total number of ways to deliver the packages to the houses is \\(4!\\) (since there are 4 houses and 4 packages), and the number of ways to deliver exactly two packages to the correct houses is \\(C(4,2)\\), where \\(C(n,k)\\) is the number of combinations of \\(n\\) items taken \\(k\\) at a time.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 packages out of 4 to be delivered to the correct houses is given by the combination formula:\n\\[C(4,2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\\]\n\nThe total number of ways to deliver any 4 packages to the 4 houses is:\n\\[4! = 24\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two packages are delivered to the correct houses is:\n\\[P = \\frac{C(4,2)}{4!} = \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{3}{8}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nD. \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)"
