Specifically, we can use the z-score formula to find the number of standard deviations an employee's income is from the mean.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\nwhere \\( X \\) is the income, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean income, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the income range of $13,000 to $28,000, we need to find the z-scores for both ends of this range and then use the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding probabilities.\n\nFor $13,000:\n\\[ z = \\frac{(13,000 - 20,500)}{3,750} = -0.5 \\]\n\nFor $28,000:\n\\[ z = \\frac{(28,000 - 20,500)}{3,750} = 1.5 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, we find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores:\n- For \\( z = -0.5 \\), the probability is approximately 0.3085.\n- For \\( z = 1.5 \\), the probability is approximately 0.9348.\n\nThe probability of an employee having an income between $13,000 and $28,000 is the difference between these two probabilities:\n\\[ P(-0.5 < z < 1.5) = 0.9348 - 0.3085 = 0.6263 \\]\n\nTo find the number of employees, we multiply this probability by the total number of employees:\n\\[ 0.6263 \\times 400 = 250.52 \\]\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an employee, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 251.\n\nTherefore, the number of employees with an income between $13,000 and $28,000 is 251, which corresponds to option A."
