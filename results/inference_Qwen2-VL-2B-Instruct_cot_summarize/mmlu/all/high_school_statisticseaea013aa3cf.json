The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 90 percent confidence interval.\n\nThis is because a 90 percent confidence interval means that the true mean petal length is within 10 percent of the specified mean (3.5 cm) of the population. Since the sample mean is less than 3.5 cm, the lower limit of the confidence interval will be less than 3.5 cm, indicating that the true mean is below 3.5 cm."
