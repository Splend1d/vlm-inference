The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes. A state agency determines the eligibility of applicant institutions. Eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the payments of subsidies under the statute to all church-affiliated institutions in the state. The federal district court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action for lack of standing.\nB. uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause.\nC. invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause.\nD. uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education.\n"

The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes. The plaintiffs, eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the payments of subsidies under the statute to all church-affiliated institutions in the state.\n\nThe statute is challenged on the grounds that it is a violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the establishment of religion. The plaintiffs argue that the statute is unconstitutional because it allows the state to fund religious institutions, which is a form of religious endorsement. The court will likely invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause, as it allows the state to fund religious institutions and thereby endorse religion."
