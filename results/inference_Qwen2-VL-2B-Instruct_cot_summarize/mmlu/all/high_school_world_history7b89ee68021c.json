This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid.

The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the known world into two parts: one part was to be ruled by the King of Portugal, and the other part by the King of Castile.\n2. The demarcation line was drawn from the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa to the Antarctic pole.\n3. The demarcation line was to be drawn straight, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands.\n4. The lands discovered or to be discovered east of the demarcation line were to belong to the King of Portugal and his successors.\n5. The lands discovered or to be discovered west of the demarcation line were to belong to the King of Castile and his successors.\n\nGiven this context, the Treaty of Tordesillas was primarily aimed at dividing the known world between the two kingdoms. The demarcation line was drawn to ensure that the lands discovered or to be discovered east of the line would belong to Portugal, while the lands discovered or to be discovered west of the line would belong to Castile.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Portuguese explorers were convinced that the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east.\n- This option suggests that the Portuguese were motivated by the potential of the eastern route to the New World. However, the Treaty of Tordesillas was primarily focused on dividing the known world, not on the exploration of new routes.\n\nB. The Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land.\n- This option is not directly related to the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Treaty of Tordesillas was about dividing the known world, not about crusades.\n\nC. The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico.\n- This option is also not directly related to the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Treaty of Tordesillas was about dividing the known world, not about the control of specific territories.\n\nD. The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa.\n- This option is relevant to the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Treaty was about dividing the known world, and the demarcation line was drawn to ensure that the lands discovered or to be discovered east of the line would belong to Portugal, which had a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for the King of Portugal's insistence on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line is:\n\nD. The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa."
