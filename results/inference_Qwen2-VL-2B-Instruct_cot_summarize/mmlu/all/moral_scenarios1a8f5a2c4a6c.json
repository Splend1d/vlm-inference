This action does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is considered harmless and not harmful to the kitten. In Scenario 2, the character is feeling guilty about their possessions, which is a more complex moral issue. While it is not inherently wrong to feel guilty, the character's actions may be seen as morally problematic if they are not justified by a clear conscience or if they are not in line with their values or beliefs."
