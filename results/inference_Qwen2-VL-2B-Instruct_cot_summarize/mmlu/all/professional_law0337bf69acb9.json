He wrote mainly about consumer issues, while acting like a watchdog exposing wrongdoers. He wrote one article about a female preacher with a local church that had no affiliations and only a local blog on the internet. He wrote that she was \"conspiring with the devil\" to figure out \"how to lead people's minds astray\" and to live a nice \"sheltered role of pure moral superiority at the expense of inferiors\" like himself and his readers. He called the woman's fashion Medieval and her hair style was like a bag of \"hot wires ready to electrocute anyone who dares come too close.\" The preacher was not amused, and she filed a defamation action claiming libel per se and demanding damages along with an injunction against the web site. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.\nB. Yes, because statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions.\nC. No, because the preacher's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that will destroy her career if she doesn't get protection.\nD. No, because a defamation action cannot be subject to a motion to dismiss \u0080\u0093 the plaintiff is always entitled to present evidence to prove the tort.\n"

Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.\n- This reasoning is based on the fact that the defendant's statements were not factual assertions but rather opinions about the preacher's actions and beliefs. In the United States, opinions about matters of public concern are generally protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and expression.\n\nB. Yes, because statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions.\n- This reasoning is based on the Supreme Court's decision in the case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, where the Court ruled that statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions. This principle applies to defamation actions involving opinions about religious matters.\n\nC. No, because the preacher's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that will destroy her career if she doesn't get protection.\n- This reasoning is based on the idea that the court should not dismiss the defamation action because the plaintiff's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that could seriously harm her reputation and career. This would be a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n\nD. No, because a defamation action cannot be subject to a motion to dismiss \u0080\u0093 the plaintiff is always entitled to present evidence to prove the tort.\n- This reasoning is based on the principle that a defamation action cannot be dismissed without evidence of the tort being committed. The court would need to find that the defendant's statements were defamatory and that the plaintiff has proven the tort.\n\nGiven the context and the reasoning provided, the court is most likely to grant the motion to dismiss because the defendant's statements were opinions about the preacher's actions and beliefs, which are protected by the First Amendment. The plaintiff's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that could seriously harm her career, which would be a violation of her constitutional rights."
