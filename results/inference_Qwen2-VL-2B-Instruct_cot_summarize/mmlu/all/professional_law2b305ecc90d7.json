In order to raise funds, the state decided to consider the creation of a state postal service that only its residents may use for intrastate mail. The price for stamps printed by the state postal service would be half the cost of stamps printed by the U. S. Postal Service and would always be guaranteed to arrive within 24 hours. In addition, any employees of the state would be able to send their mail for free through the state postal service. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the proposed legislation?\n\nA. It constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws, because employees of the state receive personal benefits that are not enjoyed by employees of other states.\nB. The negative implications that flow from the delegation to Congress of the power to establish a post office prohibit such a state postal service.\nC. It denies citizens of the state who are not state government employees their rights under the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. It interferes with the sovereign autonomy of the U. S. Postal Service to operate as an independent federal agency.\n"

This could be seen as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees equal protection under the law.\n\n**Option B:**\n- This argument claims that the delegation of the power to establish a post office to Congress prohibits such a state postal service. This is based on the idea that the U.S. Postal Service is an independent federal agency, and the state postal service would be interfering with this autonomy. This argument is strong because it directly addresses the constitutional principle of separation of powers and the need for a federal agency to operate independently.\n\n**Option C:**\n- This argument claims that the state postal service would deny citizens of the state who are not state government employees their rights under the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is a strong argument because it directly addresses the state's ability to provide certain benefits to its residents, which could be seen as a violation of the privileges or immunities clause.\n\n**Option D:**\n- This argument suggests that the state postal service would interfere with the sovereign autonomy of the U.S. Postal Service to operate as an independent federal agency. This is a strong argument because it directly challenges the U.S. Postal Service's independence and the need for a federal agency to operate as an independent entity.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that **Option B** is the strongest constitutional argument against the proposed legislation. It directly addresses the constitutional principle of separation of powers and the need for a federal agency to operate independently.\n\n**Final Answer: B. The negative implications that flow from the delegation to Congress of the power to establish a post office prohibit such a state postal service.**"
