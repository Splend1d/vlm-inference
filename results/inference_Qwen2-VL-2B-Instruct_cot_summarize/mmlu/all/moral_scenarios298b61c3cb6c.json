This scenario does not involve any clear moral wrongs, as the character is not engaging in any actions that are inherently wrong or unethical. In Scenario 2, the main character uses \"I\" to describe their actions, which are to kiss their girlfriend at the magic show. This scenario involves a clear moral wrong, as kissing someone without their consent is generally considered inappropriate and morally wrong."
