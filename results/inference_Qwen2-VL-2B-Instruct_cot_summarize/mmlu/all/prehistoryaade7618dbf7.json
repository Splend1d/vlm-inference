Neandertals used caves in Europe where their remains were preserved.\n\nNeandertals were the last surviving species of Homo sapiens before the arrival of modern humans in Europe around 30,000 years ago. They lived in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and their remains have been found in caves and other archaeological sites across these continents. The preservation of their remains in caves allowed scientists to study their physical characteristics, tools, and other artifacts, providing valuable insights into their lifestyle and culture."
