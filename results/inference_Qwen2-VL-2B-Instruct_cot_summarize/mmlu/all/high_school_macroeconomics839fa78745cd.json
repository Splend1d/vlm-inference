Net exports in the United States fall.\n\nWhen the United States places an import quota on imported sugar, it means that the country is limiting the amount of sugar that can be imported. This can lead to a decrease in the supply of sugar in the domestic market, as producers are incentivized to produce more sugar domestically to meet the quota. As a result, the domestic supply of sugar increases, which can lead to a decrease in the price of sugar and an increase in consumer demand. This can also lead to a decrease in the demand for other products that use sugar, such as baked goods and beverages. Therefore, the net effect on net exports in the United States is a decrease."
