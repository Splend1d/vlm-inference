He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nWhich best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage?\n\nA. Uneasy allies\nB. Comrades-in-arms\nC. Mortal enemies\nD. Distant strangers\n"

Colonel Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. This indicates a clear division between the two sides.\n2. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. This suggests a clear division of territory.\n3. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. This further emphasizes the division between the two sides.\n4. Bonesteel decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities. This clearly delineates the boundaries between the two sides.\n\nGiven these points, the relationship between the United States and the Soviets can be described as:\n\n**A. Uneasy allies**\n\nThis option best captures the tension and mutual distrust between the two nations, as Bonesteel's decision was made to prevent the Soviets from seizing all of Korea, which would have been a significant threat to the United States."
