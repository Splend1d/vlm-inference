Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.\n\nWhen an officer arrests a suspect in an automobile, the officer has the authority to search the trunk of the vehicle as part of the arrest process. This is because the trunk is a part of the vehicle's interior and is typically accessible to the officer during the arrest. The officer has probable cause to search the trunk because the suspect was arrested in the vehicle, and the officer has the right to search the vehicle to ensure that the suspect is not hiding evidence or to protect the officer's safety."
