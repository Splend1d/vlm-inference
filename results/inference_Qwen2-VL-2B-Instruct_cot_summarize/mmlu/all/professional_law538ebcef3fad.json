The prosecutor has called the friend's mother to testify to a conversation she had with her son the day before he left the country. She implored him not to go, but he said, \"Mom, I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\" The prosecutor has other evidence indicating that the defendant and the friend were together on the morning of the robbery. Is the statement by the friend to his mother admissible?\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.\nB. No, because the friend's statement to his mother was not corroborated.\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\nD. Yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n"

The confrontation clause is designed to prevent the admission of statements made during a trial that are intended to incriminate the defendant. In this case, the statement by the friend to his mother was not intended to incriminate the defendant but rather to express his own state of mind about his involvement in the robbery. Therefore, it does not satisfy the confrontation clause.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause."
