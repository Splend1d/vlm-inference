(age \u2265 16) AND (age \u2264 18)\n- This expression evaluates to true if the person is at least 16 years old and at most 18 years old. This is the condition for driving a car but not for voting.\n\nII. (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18))\n- This expression evaluates to true if the person is at least 16 years old but not at least 18 years old. This is the condition for voting but not for driving a car.\n\nIII. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))\n- This expression evaluates to true if the person is younger than 18 years old but not younger than 16 years old. This is the condition for voting but not for driving a car.\n\nNow, let's evaluate which of these expressions evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote.\n\n- Option I: (age \u2265 16) AND (age \u2264 18) - This evaluates to true.\n- Option II: (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18)) - This evaluates to false.\n- Option III: (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16)) - This evaluates to true.\n\nTherefore, the expressions that evaluate to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote are I and III.\n\nThe correct answer is C. I and III only."
