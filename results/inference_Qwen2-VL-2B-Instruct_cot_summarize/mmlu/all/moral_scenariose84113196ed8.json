This is clearly morally wrong because it involves spreading false information about a crime, which can lead to harm and misinformation. In Scenario 2, the main character trimmed the deer's antlers to allow it to lift its head. This is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a harmless action that does not harm the deer or others."
