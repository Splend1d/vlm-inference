The IQ scores are typically distributed in a bell-shaped curve, with the mean (average) score being around 100 and the standard deviation being around 15. The 97th percentile corresponds to a score that is higher than 97% of the population.\n\nLet's calculate the IQ score that corresponds to the 97th percentile:\n\n1. Find the IQ score that is 97% of the population:\n\\[ \\text{IQ score at 97th percentile} = 100 + 0.97 \\times 15 = 100 + 14.55 = 114.55 \\]\n\n2. Since Jonathan's IQ score is in the 97th percentile, his score is likely to be higher than 114.55 but less than 150.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 85\nB. 100\nC. 130\nD. 150\n\nThe most likely score for Jonathan's IQ score is:\n\nB. 100"
