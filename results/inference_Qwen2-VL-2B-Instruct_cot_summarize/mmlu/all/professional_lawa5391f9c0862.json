However, a study by the federal Food and Drug Administration revealed that the pies contain potentially harmful levels of nuts for some consumers with nut allergies. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines. A state has a statute that regulates the shipment and sale of the pies within its territory. In light of the federal legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines, the state statute is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because Congress may not regulate an economic activity where both buyer and seller reside in the same state.\nC. unconstitutional, because it affects interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because the federal law preempts any conflicting state legislation regarding the sale and shipment of the pies.\n"

This means that if a federal law is more stringent or comprehensive than a state law, the federal law takes precedence.\n\n2. **Contextual Analysis**: The federal law prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines is more stringent than the state statute regulating the sale and shipment within the state. This is because the federal law prohibits the shipment and sale of the pies entirely, whereas the state statute only prohibits the shipment and sale within the state.\n\n3. **Preemption Doctrine**: The preemption doctrine is invoked when a federal law is more comprehensive than a conflicting state law. In this case, the federal law is more comprehensive because it prohibits the shipment and sale of the pies entirely, whereas the state law only prohibits the shipment and sale within the state.\n\nTherefore, the state statute is unconstitutional because it conflicts with the federal law, which is preempted by the federal law.\n\nFinal Answer: D. unconstitutional."
