Asking about someone else's feelings without their consent is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) crossed out her sister's name in a public restroom stall, which is a violation of privacy and could be considered disrespectful or even harmful to her feelings. However, in both scenarios, the main character's actions are not explicitly stated to be morally wrong, as they are not explicitly stated to be wrong."
