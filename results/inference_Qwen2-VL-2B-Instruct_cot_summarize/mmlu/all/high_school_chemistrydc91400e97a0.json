The samples were titrated with standard potassium hydroxide, KOH, solution. Cresol red was the acid-base indicator used in the titration. The samples required 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL to reach the endpoint. Which of the following might explain why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint?\n\nA. The indicator was added too late.\nB. The wrong indicator was used.\nC. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.\nD. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n"

There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\nWhen a base is added to a solution, it reacts with any acid present to form a salt and water. In this case, the base would react with the phenol to form a salt, which would then react with the indicator to change its color. If there was an acid contaminating the beaker, it would react with the phenol and the base, preventing the formation of the salt and the change in color of the indicator. This would result in a longer time required to reach the endpoint.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation for why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint is that there was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker."
