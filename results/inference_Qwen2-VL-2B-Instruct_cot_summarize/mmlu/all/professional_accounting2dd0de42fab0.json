In this case, the copyright has a useful life of 60 years (50 years for the author plus 10 years for the copyright itself).\n\nThe amortization expense is calculated as follows:\n\nCost of the copyright: $20000\nEstimated useful life of the copyright: 60 years\n\nAmortization expense = Cost of the copyright / Estimated useful life of the copyright\nAmortization expense = $20000 / 60 years\nAmortization expense = $333.33 (approximately)\n\nSince the amortization expense is a non-cash expense, it is not reported on the income statement. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $0"
