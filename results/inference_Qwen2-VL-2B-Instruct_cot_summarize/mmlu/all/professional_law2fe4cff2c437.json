                    "text": "On Tuesday, a homeowner purchased a new riding lawnmower from a department store. The next day, he was cutting the grass in his back yard with the mower when it started to rain. He stopped the mower and turned off the motor switch. He went inside and decided to wait until the rain stopped before mowing the rest of the lawn. A few minutes later while the homeowner was inside his house, the lawnmower suddenly lurched forward, rolled down a hill, and entered the property of his neighbor. The mower cut the neighbor's prize rosebushes, destroying them. It was later determined that the lawnmower's motor switch was defective. Even though the homeowner had turned the starter switch to the off position, the engine did not shut off. Because the mower was built with a new silent rotary engine, the homeowner had no reason to know that it was still running when he went into the house. The homeowner would not have been able to discover the defect by any feasible means of inspection. If the neighbor asserts a claim against the homeowner for trespass, will the neighbor prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the lawnmower entered onto the neighbor's property.\nB. Yes, because the homeowner is strictly liable for the damage caused by the defective mower.\nC. No, because the homeowner was using the mower for its intended purpose.\nD. No, because the defective motor switch was not discoverable by reasonable inspection.\n"

                    "text": "The homeowner's claim for trespass will likely be upheld, but the reasoning behind this conclusion is nuanced. Here's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the lawnmower entered onto the neighbor's property.\n- This option suggests that the neighbor's property was invaded by the mower, which is a valid point. However, the homeowner's claim is based on the motor switch defect, not the physical entry of the mower into the neighbor's property. The neighbor's property was not invaded; it was merely damaged by the mower.\n\nB. Yes, because the homeowner is strictly liable for the damage caused by the defective mower.\n- This option is incorrect because the homeowner is not strictly liable for the damage caused by the defective mower. The homeowner's liability is based on the defect in the motor switch, not the physical entry of the mower into the neighbor's property.\n\nC. No, because the homeowner was using the mower for its intended purpose.\n- This option is incorrect because the homeowner was using the mower for its intended purpose, which was to cut grass in his back yard. The mower was not used for any other purpose, such as mowing the neighbor's lawn.\n\nD. No, because the defective motor switch was not discoverable by reasonable inspection.\n- This option is incorrect because the homeowner had no reason to know that the mower was still running when he went into the house. The neighbor's property was not invaded, and the mower was not physically entered onto the neighbor's property. The homeowner's claim is based on the defect in the motor switch, not the physical entry of the mower into the neighbor's property.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. No, because the defective motor switch was not discoverable by reasonable inspection."
