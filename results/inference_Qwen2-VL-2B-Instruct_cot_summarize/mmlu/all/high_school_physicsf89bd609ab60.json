When the lens is used to examine a small coin, the coin is the object and the lens is the lens of the convex lens.\n\nThe focal length of the convex lens is given as \\( f = 0.2 \\) m. The distance from the lens to the object is \\( d_1 = 0.3 \\) m, and the distance from the lens to the image is \\( d_2 = 0.1 \\) m.\n\nThe magnification \\( m \\) of the image can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{0.1}{0.3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nThis means that the image is formed at a distance of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) times the distance from the lens to the object, which is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the focal length.\n\nSince the focal length of the convex lens is \\( 0.2 \\) m, the image formed by the lens is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Image distance} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.2 = 0.0667 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nThis means the image is formed at a distance of \\( 0.0667 \\) m from the lens, which is smaller than the distance from the lens to the object.\n\nAs the lens is moved closer to the coin, the distance from the lens to the object decreases, and the distance from the lens to the image increases. Therefore, the image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size."
