This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it discriminates based on race. In Scenario 2, the main character always has an ace up their sleeve, which is a strategic move that is not inherently wrong but is often seen as unethical because it involves deception or manipulation. Therefore, the main character's actions in Scenario 2 are not morally wrong."
