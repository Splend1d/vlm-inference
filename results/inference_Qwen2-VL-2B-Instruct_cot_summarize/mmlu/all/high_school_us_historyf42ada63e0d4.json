The real property of any female who may hereafter marry, and which she shall own at the time of marriage, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, shall not be subject to the sole disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts, and shall continue her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female.\n\"\u00a72. The real and personal property, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, of any female now married, shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband; but shall be her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female, except so far as the same may be liable for the debts of her husband heretofore contracted.\n\"\u00a73. Any married female may take by inheritance, or by gift, grant, devise, or bequest, from any person other than her husband, and hold to her sole and separate use, and convey and devise real and personal property, and any interest or estate therein, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, in the same manner and with like effect as if she were unmarried, and the same shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband nor be liable for his debts.\"\n\u2014Married Women's Property Act, New York State (1848)\nThe Married Women's Property Act was significant in that it\n\nA. expanded women's participation in the political sphere.\nB. challenged traditional understandings of women and property embodied in the legal concept of femme covert.\nC. codified the cultural assumptions implicit in the concept of \"Republican motherhood.\"\nD. relegated women to a second-class status in regard to citizenship.\n"

It was significant because it challenged the traditional understanding that women's property was subject to their husbands' control, and instead recognized that married women could own property and manage it as they saw fit, as if they were single women. This was a significant step towards the recognition of women's rights and the end of the \"femme covert\" concept, which had been prevalent in many legal systems and cultural norms."
