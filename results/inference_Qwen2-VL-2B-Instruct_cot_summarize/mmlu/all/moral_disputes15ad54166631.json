Kamm argues that the scientist's motivation is not bad, as it is driven by a desire for mastery, which she argues is not inherently bad.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.\n- This option aligns with Kamm's argument. She suggests that the scientist's desire for mastery is not inherently bad, and therefore, the action of seeking a cure for congenital blindness can be permissible.\n\nB. All actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible.\n- This option is incorrect. Kamm does not claim that all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible. She argues that the scientist's desire for mastery is not inherently bad, and therefore, the action of seeking a cure for congenital blindness can be permissible.\n\nC. The desire for mastery is not, as Sandel argues, a bad desire.\n- This option is incorrect. Kamm does not argue that the desire for mastery is not a bad desire. She argues that it is not inherently bad, but rather, it is not inherently good either.\n\nD. Sometimes the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires.\n- This option is incorrect. Kamm does not argue that the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires. She argues that the scientist's desire for mastery is not inherently bad, and therefore, the action of seeking a cure for congenital blindness can be permissible.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire."
