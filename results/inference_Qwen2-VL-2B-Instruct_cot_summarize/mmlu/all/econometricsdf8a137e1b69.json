Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts.\n\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a common measure used to evaluate the accuracy of financial forecasts, particularly in the context of asset returns. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the forecasted values and the actual values, divided by the actual values. MAPE penalizes large forecast errors more heavily than small ones, making it a useful tool for assessing the accuracy of asset return forecasts."
