As the tenant inspected the room one last time, he noticed a bookcase that he had screwed into the wall when he first moved in. While he pondered whether to remove the bookcase, the tenant concluded that it constituted a fixture and, therefore, was a permanent part of the realty. Nonetheless, the tenant decided that the bookcase would fit nicely in his new apartment, so he removed it from the bedroom wall. When the landlord learned that the tenant had removed the bookcase, he contacted the tenant and demanded that he return it to the apartment. The tenant refused. If the tenant is subsequently prosecuted for larceny, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because the chattel was the personal property of the landlord.\nB. guilty, because severance of the bookcase from the wall was sufficient asportation to constitute larceny.\nC. not guilty, because the tenant cannot be found guilty of theft for removing his own property.\nD. not guilty, because the bookcase was a fixture.\n"

In this case, the bookcase was permanently attached to the wall when the tenant moved in, and therefore, it would be considered a fixture. As a result, the tenant would be found guilty of larceny, as the removal of the fixture constitutes asportation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. guilty, because severance of the bookcase from the wall was sufficient asportation to constitute larceny."
