The argument revolves around the justification of rights based on their impact on overall welfare.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"There are no moral rights; there is only utility.\"\n- This option suggests that rights are not morally justified but rather based on utility. This is not the core argument of the utilitarian.\n\nB. \"A moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will not diminish overall welfare.\"\n- This option aligns well with the core argument of the utilitarian. It states that a moral right is justified by the fact that its recognition will not diminish overall welfare, which is a key principle of utilitarianism.\n\nC. \"A moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will contribute to the maximization of overall welfare.\"\n- This option is also consistent with the core argument of the utilitarian. It emphasizes that a moral right is justified by the fact that its recognition will contribute to the overall welfare, which is a central tenet of utilitarianism.\n\nD. \"All of the above\"\n- This option encompasses both A and C, making it the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
