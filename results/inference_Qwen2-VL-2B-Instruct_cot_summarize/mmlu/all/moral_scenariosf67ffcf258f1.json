This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves intentionally causing harm to others for personal gain. \n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character, who is a kidnapper, is stomping on the foot of a tall person. This action is not morally wrong in the same way as the first scenario. Stomping on someone's foot is generally considered a minor physical act and is not typically considered a morally wrong action. However, it is important to note that this action could be considered illegal and potentially harmful to the person being stomped on."
