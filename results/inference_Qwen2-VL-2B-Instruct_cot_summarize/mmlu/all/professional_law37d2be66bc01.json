The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following \"modified\" comparative negligence statute:\"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. \"Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of\n\nA. $100,000. 00\nB. $55,000. 00\nC. $45,000. 00\nD. nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.\n"

The modified comparative negligence statute states that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages if the plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the given information:\n\n1. The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding.\n2. The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light.\n3. The friend suffered $100,000 in damages.\n\nTo determine the amount of damages the friend should receive, we need to calculate the percentage of negligence that the fan's speeding contributed to the total negligence. The fan's negligence is 55%, and the driver's negligence is 45%.\n\nThe total negligence is the sum of the fan's and the driver's negligence:\n\\[ 55\\% + 45\\% = 100\\% \\]\n\nThe friend's negligence is the difference between the total negligence and the fan's negligence:\n\\[ 100\\% - 55\\% = 45\\% \\]\n\nThe friend's negligence is 45%, which is less than the driver's negligence (45%). Therefore, the friend is entitled to recover damages.\n\nThe amount of damages the friend should receive is:\n\\[ \\text{Friend's negligence} \\times \\text{Total negligence} = 45\\% \\times 100\\% = 45\\% \\times \\$100,000 = \\$45,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. $45,000. 00"
