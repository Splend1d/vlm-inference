Deep cleaning a bath is a necessary household task, and covering it with crude oil is not only harmful to the environment but also illegal and unethical. In Scenario 2, the main character's action of telling his terrified little brother that there's a monster in his closet is not morally wrong. This is because telling a child that there's a monster in their closet is a common and harmless practice, and it is not harmful to the child or the environment."
