His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\nB. The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.\nC. The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.\nD. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n"

                    "text": "To determine who should receive the fee simple absolute title to the estate, we need to analyze the circumstances surrounding the estate and the actions taken by the parties involved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Estate and Cotenancy**: The estate is devised to the son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common.\" This means that the estate is divided equally between the son and daughter, with the son having a 50% interest and the daughter having a 50% interest.\n\n2. **Disputes and Actions**: In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject.\n\n3. **Adverse Possession**: The Midwestern states have an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute. This means that if the son has occupied the estate for 20 years without the consent of the daughter, he can acquire the fee simple absolute title to the estate.\n\n4. **Actions Taken by the Parties**: The son has put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has not pressed her brother about the property. The daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the son has occupied the estate for 20 years without the consent of the daughter, he can acquire the fee simple absolute title to the estate. The daughter cannot acquire title by adverse possession against the son because the son has occupied the estate for 20 years without the consent of the daughter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.**"
