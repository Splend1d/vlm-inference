That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

It mentions the exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside Western Europe, particularly Africa, to achieve this leap.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa - This option suggests the colonization of Africa, which was a significant event in the history of Western Europe. However, it does not directly address the technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions that are central to the passage's assertion.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire - This option refers to the conquest of the Aztec Empire, which was a significant event in the history of the Americas. While it is important, it does not directly address the technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions that are central to the passage's assertion.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity - This option refers to the reformation of Catholic Christianity, which was a significant event in the history of Western Europe. While it is important, it does not directly address the technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions that are central to the passage's assertion.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan - This option refers to the isolationism of Tokugawa Japan, which was a significant event in the history of Japan. While it is important, it does not directly address the technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions that are central to the passage's assertion.\n\nGiven the passage's emphasis on technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions, the option that best supports the author's assertion is:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa\n\nThis option directly addresses the technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions that are central to the passage's assertion, as it involves the exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside Western Europe."
