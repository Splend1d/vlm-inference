Less than the block's gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.\n\nWhen the object is released from rest at the top of the incline, it gains gravitational potential energy. However, as it slides down the incline, some of this potential energy is converted to thermal energy due to friction with the incline. The remaining potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the object moves down the incline. Therefore, the object's kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline is less than the block's gravitational potential energy when it was released."
