However, if the skateboarder is not aware of the pedestrian traffic or if they are not paying attention to their surroundings, they could potentially cause harm to others. This scenario does not necessarily involve a clear moral wrong, as it is a common and legal activity.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character fed their kitten wet cat food 3 times a day. This is a common practice for cats and is generally considered ethical and beneficial for their health. However, if the cat food is not of high quality or if it is not balanced with the necessary nutrients for the cat's specific needs, it could lead to health issues for the cat. This scenario does not necessarily involve a clear moral wrong, as it is a common and legal practice."
