(P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U\n- This option suggests that if the president approved (P) and the board didn't prevent (B), then the university raised tuition (U). This option implies a conditional relationship between the president's approval and the board's prevention, but it doesn't capture the full context of the sentence.\n\nB. (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B\n- This option suggests that if the university raised tuition (U), then the president approved of it (P). This option captures the full context of the sentence, but it doesn't explicitly state that the board didn't prevent it.\n\nC. U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\n- This option suggests that if the university raised tuition (U), then the president approved of it (P) and the board didn't prevent it (~B). This option captures the full context of the sentence, including the board's prevention.\n\nD. U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B)\n- This option suggests that if the university raised tuition (U), then the president approved of it (P) or the board didn't prevent it (~B). This option captures the full context of the sentence, but it doesn't explicitly state that the president approved of it.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nC. U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B)\n\nThis option captures the full context of the sentence, including the president's approval and the board's prevention."
