                    "text": "The commuter will probably prevail if the operator of the subway was not negligent in making the stop. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Negligence**: The commuter asserts a claim against the subway company to recover for his personal injuries. This claim hinges on the subway operator's duty to ensure the safety of passengers. If the subway operator was not negligent in making the stop, the claim would likely be successful.\n\n2. **Special Duty of Care**: The commuter argues that the subway operator owed a special duty of care to the commuter, which includes ensuring the safety of passengers. If the subway operator was not negligent in making the stop, the claim would likely be successful based on this special duty.\n\n3. **Negligence**: The commuter also argues that the subway operator was negligent in making the stop. If the subway operator was negligent, the claim would likely be unsuccessful.\n\nTherefore, the commuter will probably prevail if the subway operator was not negligent in making the stop. The other options are not directly supported by the information provided:\n\n- **A. prevail, because a special duty of care was owed him.** This is not necessarily true because the special duty of care is not directly relevant to the claim.\n- **B. prevail, because the sudden stop caused the resident to fall onto him.** This is not necessarily true because the sudden stop is not necessarily the cause of the injury.\n- **D. not prevail, if the resident was negligent in not holding onto the hand rail.** This is not necessarily true because the claim is based on the operator's negligence, not the resident's.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. not prevail, if the operator of the subway was not negligent in making the stop.**"
