We are given that $C_F = 1$ dollar per unit of volume, so $C_F = 100$ cents per unit of volume.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Glow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright. This means that $C_G = C_B - 0.25C_B = 0.75C_B$. Substituting $C_B = 100$ cents per unit of volume, we get $C_G = 0.75 \\times 100 = 75$ cents per unit of volume.\n\nNext, we know that Glow has $33\\frac{1}{3} \\%$ more volume than Fresh. This means that $V_G = V_F + 0.333333333333333V_F = 1.333333333333333V_F$. Substituting $V_F = 1$ unit of volume, we get $V_G = 1.333333333333333 \\times 1 = 1.333333333333333$ units of volume.\n\nFinally, we know that Bright is $60\\%$ more expensive than Fresh. This means that $C_B = C_F + 0.60C_F = 1.60C_F$. Substituting $C_F = 100$ cents per unit of volume, we get $C_B = 1.60 \\times 100 = 160$ cents per unit of volume.\n\nNow, we can find the cost of Glow by subtracting the cost of Fresh from the cost of Bright: $C_G = C_B - C_F = 160 - 100 = 60$ cents per unit of volume.\n\nTherefore, the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow is $\\boxed{60}$ cents per unit of volume.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{60}$."
