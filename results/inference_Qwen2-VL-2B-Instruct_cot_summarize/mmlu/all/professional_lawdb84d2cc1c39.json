The law was passed in order to curtail the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. Two students at a state university are engaged to be married and wish to share a dormitory room together. Citing the law, university housing officials refuse to allow them to live together in a campus dormitory facility. The students bring an appropriate action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Which of the following correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion?\n\nA. Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nB. Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nC. Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.\nD. Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n"

Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the law does not involve a fundamental right or gender discrimination, which are key considerations in determining the burden of persuasion in a constitutional challenge. The state must prove that the law furthers a compelling state interest, not that it does not."
