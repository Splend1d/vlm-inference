Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(x_i\\) represents each individual score, and \\(n\\) is the total number of scores.\n\nIf the largest score is increased by 40 points, the new sum of the scores will be:\n\n\\[\n\\sum x_i' = \\sum x_i + 40\n\\]\n\nThe new mean (\\(\\bar{x}'\\)) will be:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x}' = \\frac{\\sum x_i'}{n}\n\\]\n\nSince the sum of the scores (\\(\\sum x_i\\)) increases by 40, the new mean (\\(\\bar{x}'\\)) will also increase by 40 points.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. It will increase by 40 points."
