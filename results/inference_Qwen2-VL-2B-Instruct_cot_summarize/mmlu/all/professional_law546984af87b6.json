The district court judge assured the litigant that the late filing would be permitted.\n- This is a legal reason, but it does not provide sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to file a late notice of appeal.\n\nB. The litigant's original attorney neglected to file notice on time, and now the litigant has retained a new attorney to file the appeal and has also sued the former attorney for malpractice.\n- This is a legal reason, but it does not provide sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to file a late notice of appeal.\n\nC. The litigant ran a red light causing a car crash just before the judgment was rendered, and was in the hospital for two months recovering.\n- This is a valid reason for filing a late notice of appeal, as the litigant's health and recovery are significant factors that may justify a delay in filing the appeal.\n\nD. Opposing counsel agreed not to object to the late notice of appeal.\n- This is a legal reason, but it does not provide sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to file a late notice of appeal.\n\nTherefore, the reason that constitutes sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to enable a litigant to file a late notice of appeal past the 30-day deadline is C.
