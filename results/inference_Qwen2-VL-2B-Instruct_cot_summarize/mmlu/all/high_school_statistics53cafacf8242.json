The first study was an experiment without a control group, while the second was an observational study.\n\nIn the first study, half of the class was instructed to watch exactly 1 hour of television per day, while the other half was instructed to watch 5 hours per day. This setup is an experimental design where the independent variable (TV usage) is manipulated, and the dependent variable (class grades) is measured. There is no control group in this study, as the treatment (TV usage) is applied to both groups.\n\nIn the second study, students in a class responded to a questionnaire asking about their television usage and their class grades. This is an observational study, where the dependent variable (class grades) is measured without manipulating the independent variable (TV usage). There is no control group in this study, as the treatment (TV usage) is not applied to any group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
