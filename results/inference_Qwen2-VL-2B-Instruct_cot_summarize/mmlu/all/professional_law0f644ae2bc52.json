The newborn calves need constant attention and care. One day one of the employees inadvertently leaves the fence door open and a newly-born calf breaks free and goes to his neighbor's land. The breeder went to the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf for its safety and to make sure it was unharmed. However, he was arrested on a trespass charge after entering the land. The breeder appealed. Will the court dismiss the charge?\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\nB. Yes, because the tender pet doctrine allows temporary entry to retrieve baby animals.\nC. No, because the neighbor had a right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land.\nD. No, because his status as a breeder made him unqualified for a limited license.\n"

This is a common scenario where a breeder has a limited right to enter private property to protect their livestock. The breeder's primary purpose was to prevent harm to the calf, which is a significant concern for the breeder.\n\nThe neighbor's right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto their land is a general principle, but it does not override the breeder's limited privilege to enter the land to protect their property. The breeder's limited privilege is based on the need to prevent harm to the calf, which is a significant concern for the breeder.\n\nTherefore, the court will likely dismiss the charge of trespass because the breeder had a limited privilege to enter the neighbor's land to prevent harm to his chattel.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel."
