Because he conceives of laws in a pragmatic rather than a conceptual manner.\n\nAustin's 'naive empiricist' perspective is characterized by his belief that laws are simply rules that people follow without necessarily understanding the underlying principles or concepts that govern them. He argues that laws are not necessarily moral or ethical, but rather are simply conventions that people follow to achieve certain ends. This perspective is often associated with his work on the concept of 'law as a social convention' and his critique of legal positivism."
