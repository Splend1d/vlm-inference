The formula sqrt(GM/R) represents the square root of the product of the gravitational constant (G) and the mass (M) of the celestial body, divided by the radius (R) of the body. This formula is derived from the principle of conservation of energy in the context of celestial mechanics. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. v = sqrt(GM/R)"
