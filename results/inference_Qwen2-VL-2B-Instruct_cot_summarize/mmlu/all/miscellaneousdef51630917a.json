                    "text": "To determine which sequence of events is consistent with the presence of a layer of sandstone in bedrock just above a layer of shale, we need to consider the processes that can lead to the formation of sandstone from shale.\n\n1. **A volcano erupted, sending lava out over a layer of shale. The lava cooled and hardened into sandstone.**\n   - This scenario involves volcanic activity, which can indeed produce lava. However, the formation of sandstone from lava is not a direct process. Lava typically cools and solidifies into lava flows, which can then be deposited and lithified to form sedimentary rocks like sandstone. The lava itself does not directly form sandstone but rather the sedimentary rock it forms.\n\n2. **The water level of a large lake lowered. A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.**\n   - This scenario describes the formation of a beach due to a lowering of the water level of a lake. Beaches are typically formed by the deposition of sand and other sediments by waves and currents. The formation of sandstone from shale is not a direct process of beach formation.\n\n3. **One-celled organisms developed a colony on the seafloor. Shells made by these organisms accumulated and lithified, forming the sandstone.**\n   - This scenario involves the formation of sandstone from the accumulation of shells by one-celled organisms. This is a common process in the formation of fossiliferous sediments, where organisms accumulate in sedimentary layers and eventually lithify over time.\n\n4. **Mud was deposited and lithified. Subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone.**\n   - This scenario describes the formation of sandstone from mud deposited over shale. Contact metamorphism is a process where the shale is subjected to high temperatures and pressures, leading to recrystallization and the formation of sandstone.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most consistent sequence of events that leads to the formation of sandstone from shale is:\n\n**D. Mud was deposited and lithified. Subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone.**\n\nThis process involves the deposition of mud, which can then be lithified and subjected to contact metamorphism, leading to the formation of sandstone."
