It will fall with decreasing speed and increasing acceleration.\n\nIn free fall, an object experiences a constant acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 on Earth. The drag force on the object is proportional to its speed, so as the object falls, its speed decreases due to the drag force. This results in an increasing acceleration as the object falls, which is why the correct answer is C."
