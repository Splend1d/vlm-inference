The pH is calculated using the following equation:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\nIn this case, the pH of the solution is 4.26, and the concentration of hydrogen ions is 10^-4.26. Therefore, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the concentration of hydrogen ions:\n\n[H+] = 10^-4.26\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the weak acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\n\nwhere Ka is the equilibrium constant for the acid-base reaction. The equilibrium constant for a weak acid is given by:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (in this case, the weak acid), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for [HA]:\n\n[HA] = [H+][A-]/Ka\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of [H+] and Ka into the equation:\n\n[HA] = (10^-4.26)(10^-4.26)/Ka\n\nSince [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Ka:\n\nKa = [HA]^2/[H+][A-]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of [H+] and Ka into the equation:\n\nKa = (10^-4.26)^2/[10^-4.26]/(10^-4.26)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nKa = 10^-8.52\n\nTherefore, the pKa of the weak acid is 8.52. The correct answer is B. 8.52."
