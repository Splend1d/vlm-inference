The loaves were to be delivered on the first day of each week, with payment to be made within four days of delivery. For the first four weeks, the bakery delivered loaves to the supermarket and the supermarket made the appropriate payments. When the fifth delivery arrived, the supermarket discovered that the shipment contained 80 whole wheat loaves and 20 sourdough loaves. The manager of the supermarket immediately called the bakery to complain about the shipment. The operator of the bakery apologized and offered to send 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours. What is the probable legal effect of the operator's conversation with the manager with regard to the fifth shipment?\n\nA. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment and cancel their contract.\nB. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment, but would be held liable for the remaining deliveries.\nC. The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure. \"\nD. The supermarket would have a right to \"cover\" by purchasing substitute loaves of bread.\n"

The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure.\"\n\nWhen a supermarket receives a shipment that is not in accordance with the contract terms, it has the right to reject the shipment and cancel the contract. However, in this case, the supermarket did not reject the shipment outright but instead offered to \"cure\" by purchasing substitute loaves of bread. The operator's offer to send 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours is a valid attempt to rectify the situation and fulfill the contract. Therefore, the supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure\" and would be held liable for the remaining deliveries.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment, but would be held liable for the remaining deliveries."
