The pain began after the patient lifted a heavy box onto his truck. He rates his current pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. He has been unable to find a comfortable position and has been sleeping in a recliner. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, and he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday and Saturday nights. BMI is 27 kg/m2 . He appears uncomfortable and stands during the physical examination. Vital signs are normal. Straight-leg raise test is positive on the right, with loss of right ankle reflex. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms?\n\nA. Displacement of the nucleus pulposus\nB. Hypertrophy of the facet joints\nC. Osteophyte formation\nD. Spondylolisthesis\n"

Osteophyte formation\n\nThis is because the patient has a history of smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, which can lead to degenerative changes in the spine, including osteophyte formation. The patient's symptoms of mid-low back pain, radiating down his right leg, and inability to find a comfortable position suggest a degenerative spine condition. The positive straight-leg raise test on the right side with loss of right ankle reflex further supports the diagnosis of osteophyte formation."
