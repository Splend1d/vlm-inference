Bush allowed Saddam Hussein to remain in power after the Gulf War of 1991 because the UN Security Council had limited authority to impose sanctions on Iraq, and the United States was concerned about the potential for a protracted conflict that could lead to civilian casualties. Additionally, the United States was hesitant to use military force against Iraq, as it was a country with significant oil reserves and was a major ally of the United States."
