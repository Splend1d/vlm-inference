It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. A PED of greater than 1 indicates that the quantity demanded is more responsive to changes in price than the price itself, while a PED of less than 1 indicates that the quantity demanded is less responsive to changes in price than the price itself.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. the proportion of the good of the consumer's budget is high.\n\nWhen the proportion of the good in the consumer's budget is high, the consumer is more sensitive to changes in the price of the good. This is because the consumer has a larger amount of money to spend on the good, and a higher proportion of their budget is dedicated to it. As a result, a small change in the price of the good will have a larger impact on the quantity demanded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
