There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes, a gentleman, a landed proprietor\u201a\u00c4\u00ecnothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity. Mrs. Fairfax differs from the speaker in that Mrs. Fairfax\n\nA. has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities\nB. judges people by their social station in life\nC. is more willing to take people at face value\nD. has a more positive opinion of Mr. Rochester\n"
