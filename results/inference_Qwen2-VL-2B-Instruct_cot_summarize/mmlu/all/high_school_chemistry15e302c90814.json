                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of half-life. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for the amount of the substance to reduce to half its original amount. \n\nGiven:\n- Initial amount of the substance = 10.0 kg\n- Final amount of the substance = 1.0 microgram (10000 micrograms)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the final amount to kilograms. Since 1 microgram is equal to 10^-6 kilograms, the final amount is 1.0 x 10^-6 kilograms.\n\nNow, we can calculate the half-life using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Half-life} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\text{rate constant}} \\]\n\nHowever, we don't have the rate constant directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the half-life is inversely proportional to the square root of the initial amount. This is because the half-life is inversely proportional to the square root of the initial amount, and the square root of the initial amount is directly proportional to the half-life.\n\n\\[ \\text{Half-life} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\text{initial amount}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the half-life using the initial amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Half-life} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10.0}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Half-life} = \\frac{1.0}{0.7071} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Half-life} \\approx 1.37 \\]\n\nSince the half-life is approximately 1.37, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 13"
