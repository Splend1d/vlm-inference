The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\nC. inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\nD. inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.\n"

This testimony is relevant to the issue of liability and can be used to establish a causal connection between the helmet's design and the player's injury. The testimony is not inadmissible because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer, nor is it inadmissible because it is an admission."
