They use a different method of transforming the model so that the probabilities lie between zero and one.\n\nBoth logit and probit models are used in econometrics to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The logit model is used when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., success/failure, yes/no), while the probit model is used when the dependent variable is continuous (e.g., income, consumption). In both models, the log-odds of the dependent variable are estimated, and the probabilities are then transformed back to the original scale using the inverse logit or inverse probit function. The logit model can result in too many observations falling at exactly zero or exactly one, as the log-odds of the dependent variable can be negative or positive, and the logit function is not defined for negative values. The marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable, whereas this is not the case for the probit model. The probit model is based on a cumulative logistic function."
