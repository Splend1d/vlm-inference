After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n"

In this case, the dishwasher was manufactured by an appliance company, and the buyer purchased it from the store. The buyer asserts that the dishwasher was defective because it made a loud rattling noise when in use, which she claims caused her to break her most expensive china set.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the buyer did not assert that the dishwasher was defective. She only claimed that it made a loud rattling noise, which led to the breakage of her china set.\n\nB. **Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the buyer did not assert that she was the purchaser of the dishwasher. She purchased it from the store.\n\nC. **No, because the buyer was not personally injured.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the buyer did sustain physical damage to her china set, which is a direct consequence of the dishwasher's defect.\n\nD. **No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the buyer did not claim that she would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise. She only claimed that the noise caused her to break her china set.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.**"
