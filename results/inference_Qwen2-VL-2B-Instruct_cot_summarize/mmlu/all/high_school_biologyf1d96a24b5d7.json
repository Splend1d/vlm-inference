When a virus carries bacterial DNA into a bacterial cell, it can integrate the DNA into the bacterial chromosome, leading to the creation of new genetic combinations. This genetic variation can provide the bacteria with new traits, such as resistance to antibiotics or other environmental stresses, which can lead to the evolution of new bacterial species."
