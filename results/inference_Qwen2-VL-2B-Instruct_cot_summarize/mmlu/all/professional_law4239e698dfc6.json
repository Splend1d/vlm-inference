Therefore, Betty will inherit Greenacre.\n\n2. **Blackacre**: Sally conveyed Blackacre to \"Associate and her heirs, but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then to Betty.\" This means that if Associate consumes alcohol on Blackacre, she will inherit Blackacre. Therefore, Associate will inherit Blackacre.\n\n3. **Wine-tasting events**: Friend and Associate both hosted wine-tasting events on their properties, at which they each consumed substantial alcohol. This indicates that they consumed alcohol on the property, which is a violation of the conveyances.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude:\n\n- **Greenacre**: Betty will inherit Greenacre because she consumed alcohol on Greenacre.\n- **Blackacre**: Associate will inherit Blackacre because Associate consumed alcohol on Blackacre.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Betty // Betty**"
