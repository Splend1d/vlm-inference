The Secretary has the discretion to implement \"deferred action,\" which temporarily postpones the exportation of certain groups of undocumented immigrants. With 11.3 million people now here illegally, the Secretary implemented a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program deferred removal for two years of individuals who came to the United States as children, met certain eligibility criteria, and cleared a background check. A Sheriff in a county near the Mexican border, sued the Secretary, claiming that the policy would increase crime and drain resources in his county. The U.S. District Court dismissed the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing. On appeal, will the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely affirm the dismissal?\n\nA. Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\nB. Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\nC. No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\nD. No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n"

The Secretary has the discretion to implement \"deferred action,\" which temporarily postpones the exportation of certain groups of undocumented immigrants. The DACA program deferred removal for two years of individuals who came to the United States as children, met certain eligibility criteria, and cleared a background check.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Case**: The sheriff in the county near the Mexican border sued the Secretary, claiming that the policy would increase crime and drain resources in his county. The U.S. District Court dismissed the sheriff's claim for lack of standing. On appeal, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will likely affirm the dismissal.\n\n3. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\" This option suggests that the sheriff is speculating about future problems, which is not relevant to the current case.\n   - **Option B**: \"Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\" This option suggests that the sheriff is not a proper party to bring a claim against the executive branch, which is not the issue here.\n   - **Option C**: \"No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\" This option suggests that anyone has the right to object to the executive branch, which is not the issue here.\n   - **Option D**: \"No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\" This option suggests that the sheriff's county will indeed suffer from more immigrants, which is relevant to the claim of lack of standing.\n\nGiven the context and the issue at hand, the most relevant and logical option is:\n\n**Option D**: \"No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **D**."
