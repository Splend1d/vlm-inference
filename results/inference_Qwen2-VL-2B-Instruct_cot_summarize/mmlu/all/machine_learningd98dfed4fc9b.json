Logistic regression models are non-convex and can have multiple local optima, which means there can be multiple solutions that are equally good in terms of maximizing the likelihood.\n\nStatement 2: No classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known. This statement is false. Naive Bayes classifiers are a special case of Bayes' theorem that assumes that the features are independent given the class. However, this assumption is not always valid, especially when the features are not independent or when the class distribution is not uniform. Therefore, there can be classifiers that perform better than a naive Bayes classifier in certain cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
