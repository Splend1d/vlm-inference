This means that the lenses are too thick, causing the light rays to converge more than they should, leading to a virtual image in front of the eye.\n\nThe negative diopter (-5) indicates that the lenses are thicker than normal, which means they are creating a virtual image. The focal length of the lens is inversely proportional to the diopter value. A thicker lens will have a longer focal length, making the virtual image appear closer to the eye.\n\nGiven that the image is virtual and the diopter value is negative, the image will be inverted and real. The focal length of the lens is the distance from the lens to the point where the virtual image is formed. Since the image is virtual, it is not in front of the eye but rather behind the eye, and the focal length is the distance from the lens to the point where the virtual image is formed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes"
