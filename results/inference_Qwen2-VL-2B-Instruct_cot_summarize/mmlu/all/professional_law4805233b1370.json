One week before the start of the fall term, at a party to celebrate the law student's acceptance to the school, his father announced to the law student, in the presence of the partygoers, \"Son, it's your obligation to uphold the family tradition for excellence at the school. In this regard, if you promise to study a minimum of five hours a day, I shall pay you $1,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your first year; $2,500 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your second year; and $5,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your third year. \"The most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be that\n\nA. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.\nB. the promise would not be legally binding, since it was non-detrimental.\nC. the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.\nD. the promise constituted a voidable proposal.\n"

Specifically, the promise is contingent on the law student studying a minimum of five hours a day for the first year, achieving at least five \"A's\" during the first year, and so on for subsequent years. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be:\n\nA. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift."
