This implies that the market is in a situation where the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded, leading to a surplus.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. **Equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.**\n   - If the demand increases and the supply increases simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity will rise. However, the price change is ambiguous because the increase in supply could lead to a decrease in price if the demand increases more than the supply increases, or it could lead to an increase in price if the supply increases more than the demand increases.\n\nB. **Equilibrium quantity falls, but the price change is ambiguous.**\n   - If the demand increases and the supply increases simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity will fall. However, the price change is ambiguous because the increase in supply could lead to a decrease in price if the demand increases more than the supply increases, or it could lead to an increase in price if the supply increases more than the demand increases.\n\nC. **Equilibrium quantity rises, and the price rises.**\n   - If the demand increases and the supply increases simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity will rise. However, the price will rise because the increase in supply will lead to a decrease in the price of grapes.\n\nD. **Equilibrium quantity falls, and the price falls.**\n   - If the demand increases and the supply increases simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity will fall. However, the price will fall because the increase in supply will lead to an increase in the price of grapes.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. equilibrium quantity falls, but the price change is ambiguous.**"
