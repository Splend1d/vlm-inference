Let's check each option:\n\nA. \\(x = 6\\) gives us:\n\\[ \\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{56}{6} = 9.333... \\]\n\nThis is not a whole number, so option A is not possible.\n\nB. \\(x = 7\\) gives us:\n\\[ \\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{56}{7} = 8 \\]\n\nThis is a whole number, so option B is possible.\n\nC. \\(x = 8\\) gives us:\n\\[ \\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{56}{8} = 7 \\]\n\nThis is a whole number, so option C is possible.\n\nD. \\(x = 9\\) gives us:\n\\[ \\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{56}{9} \\approx 6.111... \\]\n\nThis is not a whole number, so option D is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the statement that could be true of the groups of marbles Tayshawn sorts is:\n\nB.
