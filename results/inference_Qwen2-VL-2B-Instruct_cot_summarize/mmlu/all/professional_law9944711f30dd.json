On March 7, the woman sent the following purchase order to a manufacturer of widgets:\"Promptly ship 1,000 widgets, catalogue #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price to our warehouse. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \"This order was received by the manufacturer on March 9. The next day, the manufacturer replied by fax:\"Your order has been received. Shipment date will be March 12. Price $50 for each widget delivered. Be advised that these are the last widgets, under catalogue #B4-IEU, that we can deliver, since this variety is no longer being manufactured. \"Upon receipt of the fax, the woman immediately sent the following fax:\"Cancel our previous order for 1,000 widgets under catalogue #B4-IEU. Price too high. \"Assume $50 per widget was the current wholesale market price. Was an enforceable contract in effect between the woman and the manufacturer?\n\nA. No, because the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer, since it didn't contain a price term.\nB. No, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance.\nC. Yes, because the woman's order created a valid option contract.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether an enforceable contract was in effect between the woman and the manufacturer, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the nature of the orders placed by both parties.\n\n1. **March 7 Order**: The woman placed an order for 1,000 widgets, catalog #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price. This is an offer to buy widgets at a specific price.\n\n2. **March 9 Order**: The manufacturer received the March 7 order and replied by fax. The reply indicated that the manufacturer would ship 1,000 widgets, catalog #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price of $50 per widget. This is an acceptance of the offer.\n\n3. **March 10 Reply**: The manufacturer faxed back to the woman, informing her that the last widgets under catalog #B4-IEU that could be delivered were no longer being manufactured. This is a new offer to the woman to cancel the previous order.\n\n4. **March 12 Order**: The woman immediately sent a fax to cancel the previous order for 1,000 widgets under catalog #B4-IEU. This is a new offer to cancel the previous order.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The March 7 order was an offer to buy widgets at a specific price.\n- The March 9 order was an acceptance of the offer.\n- The March 10 reply was a new offer to cancel the previous order.\n- The March 12 order was a new offer to cancel the previous order.\n\nSince the March 12 order was a new offer to cancel the previous order, it was not an acceptance of the March 9 order. Therefore, the March 12 order was not a valid acceptance of the March 9 order.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe March 12 order was not an enforceable contract because it was not an acceptance of the March 9 order.\n\n**Final Answer**: B. No, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance."
