The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, \"Deal.\" The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\nB. No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\nD. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n"

                    "text": "The manufacturer's statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed because the supplier's failure to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer is a key factor in the defense. The statute of frauds generally applies when a party fails to object to a contract that contains a term that is not in writing. In this case, the note sent by the manufacturer did not contain the quantity term of the contract, which is a necessary element of the contract. The statute of frauds would likely hold that the contract is not enforceable because it was not in writing, and therefore the supplier's failure to object to the note is a sufficient basis for the manufacturer to sue for breach of contract. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract."
