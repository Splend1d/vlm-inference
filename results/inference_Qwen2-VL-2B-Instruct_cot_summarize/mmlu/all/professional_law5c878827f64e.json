On direct examination, the witness testifies to how the accident occurred and also expresses his opinion that the defendant is not a truthful person.

In letters to prospective employers, the witness has described the defendant as very honest and dependable.\nB. The defendant recently filed an action against the witness for breach of contract.\nC. The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\nD. The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns.\n"

The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns.\n\nCross-examination is designed to challenge the credibility and reliability of a witness by questioning their testimony and presenting evidence that challenges the accuracy of their statements. In this case, the witness has already testified that the defendant is not a truthful person, which is a direct challenge to the defendant's credibility. Therefore, questioning about the witness's income tax returns would be irrelevant and beyond the scope of cross-examination."
