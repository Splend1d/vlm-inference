The period of the function is the time it takes for one complete cycle, which in this case is 6 hours (from high tide at 8 A.M. to low tide at 2 P.M.).\n\nThe maximum value is 15 feet (high tide), and the minimum value is 3 feet (low tide). Therefore, the rate of change is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of change} = \\frac{15 - 3}{6} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\text{ feet per hour} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3"
