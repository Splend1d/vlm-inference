This means that the calculation does not account for the fact that there are duties that are not necessarily aligned with the consequences of actions. In other words, the calculation does not take into account the fact that there are duties that are not necessarily aligned with the outcomes of actions. This is a significant flaw because it means that the calculation may not be fair or just, as it does not take into account the importance of certain duties."
