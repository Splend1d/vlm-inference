The passenger, who was extremely exhausted after a long and hectic day, tried to sleep during the flight but was constantly being annoyed by the salesman. Once the flight departed, the salesman started ordering drinks of Scotch and water from the flight attendant, and became inebriated. When the passenger refused to talk to him, the salesman became very abusive to the passenger. Although there were many empty seats available on the plane in the first-class section, the passenger decided to remain seated next to the salesman. Finally, after the flight attendant had served the saleman his tenth drink of Scotch, he became belligerent and punched the passenger in the mouth. The passenger's two front teeth were knocked loose and she suffered a cut lip. If the passenger asserts a claim against the airline based on negligence, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because, as a first-class passenger, she was owed a special duty of care by the airline.\nB. prevail, because the flight attendant should have been aware that her conduct caused an unjustifiable risk of harm.\nC. not prevail, because the airline is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its passengers.\nD. not prevail, because the passenger assumed the risk by not moving to another seat away from the salesman.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. not prevail, because the airline is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its passengers.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Negligence**: The passenger asserts a claim against the airline based on negligence. This means the airline is held responsible for the passenger's injuries if the airline could have prevented the harm through reasonable care.\n\n2. **Special Duty of Care**: The passenger was a first-class passenger, which implies she was entitled to a higher level of care from the airline. This is a common legal principle that holds that passengers in first-class are entitled to a higher standard of care than those in economy class.\n\n3. **Flight Attendant's Conduct**: The flight attendant ordered drinks of Scotch and water, which could have been a cause of the passenger's injuries. However, the airline is not vicariously liable for the conduct of its passengers. Vicarious liability is a legal doctrine that holds the airline liable for the actions of its employees, but not for the actions of its passengers.\n\n4. **Assumption of Risk**: The passenger assumed the risk by not moving to another seat away from the salesman. This is a defense that can be raised by the airline, stating that the passenger voluntarily placed herself in a dangerous situation.\n\nGiven these points, the passenger's claim against the airline will most likely be denied because the airline is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its passengers."
