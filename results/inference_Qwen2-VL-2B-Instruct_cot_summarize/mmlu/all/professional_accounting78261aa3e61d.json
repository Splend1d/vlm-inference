Let's calculate the unit cost first:\n\n- Variable cost per unit = $12\n- Fixed cost per unit = $8\n\nTotal unit cost per unit = Variable cost + Fixed cost\nTotal unit cost per unit = $12 + $8 = $20\n\nTarget contribution margin = 20% of total unit cost\nTarget contribution margin = 0.20 * $20 = $4\n\nNow, we need to find the target selling price that would yield a target contribution margin of $4 on each unit sold.\n\nTarget selling price = Target contribution margin / Contribution margin per unit\nTarget selling price = $4 / $4 = $1\n\nTherefore, the target selling price for Duct is $1.00.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $18.00"
