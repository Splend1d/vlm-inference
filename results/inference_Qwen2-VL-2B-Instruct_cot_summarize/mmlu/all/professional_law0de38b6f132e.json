Late one evening, he fell asleep in his kiosk and failed to warn of the approach of an oncoming train. A man, who was driving his car, knew of the usual presence of the watchman. As he approached the crossing, he received no warning. Driving onto the track, the man's car was struck and crushed by the train. The man died instantly. A few minutes after the accident, a police officer arrived at the crossing and walked into the kiosk. As he entered, the defendant then awoke. The police officer asked him, \"What happened here?\" The defendant made incriminating statements. The defendant is subsequently charged with involuntary manslaughter. His motion to prevent the introduction of his incriminating statements into evidence will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police officer failed to give the defendant his Miranda warnings.\nB. granted, because the police officer's conduct in questioning the defendant immediately after he awoke was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.\nC. denied, because the exchange took place in a non-custodial setting and the question was investigatory in nature.\nD. denied, because the defendant's incriminating statements were voluntary.\n"

This is a significant difference from the Miranda warnings scenario, where the defendant was in a police custody situation and the police officer was questioning him in a non-custodial setting.\n\n2. **Investigatory Nature**: The police officer's question was directed at the defendant, who was in a state of sleep and did not have the capacity to understand the nature of the question. This question was not a direct interrogation but rather a casual inquiry about what happened. The police officer's conduct was not unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.\n\n3. **Voluntary Nature**: The defendant's statements were made voluntarily, as he was asleep and did not have the capacity to understand the nature of the question. This is a different scenario from the Miranda warnings, where the defendant was not voluntarily giving incriminating statements.\n\nTherefore, the exchange in this case was not a custodial interrogation and did not involve the defendant's capacity to understand the nature of the question. The police officer's question was not unfairly prejudicial to the defendant, and the statements were voluntary. Hence, the motion to prevent the introduction of the statements into evidence will most likely be denied."
