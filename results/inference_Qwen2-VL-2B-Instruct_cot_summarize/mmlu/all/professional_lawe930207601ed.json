As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\nA. He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\nB. He intended only to wound the friend.\nC. He was unaware of the elements of malice.\nD. The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.\n"

He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\n\nThis option directly addresses the core issue of the defendant's intent, which is crucial in determining the charge of first-degree murder. The defendant's actions were directed at the friend, and the bullet struck the friend's daughter, indicating a clear intent to harm the daughter. The other options either do not address the defendant's intent or are not relevant to the defendant's defense."
