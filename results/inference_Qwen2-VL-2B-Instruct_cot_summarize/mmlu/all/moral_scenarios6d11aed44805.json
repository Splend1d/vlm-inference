It is considered reckless and dangerous, as it can lead to accidents and injuries.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character called the cops on his ex-lover because he hit him. This action is also morally wrong, as it involves using the police to enforce a personal vendetta or to seek revenge. It is considered a violation of the ex-lover's rights and can lead to legal consequences."
