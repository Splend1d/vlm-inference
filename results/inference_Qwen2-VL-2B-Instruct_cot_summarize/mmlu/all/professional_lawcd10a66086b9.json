If you will promise to mow my lawn by Saturday, I will pay you $50. \" On Friday, the gardener arrived at the man's home just as the man was leaving for work and began to mow the man's lawn. The man said nothing to the gardener but drove off as he saw the gardener unloading his lawn mower. When the man arrived home from work that evening, he noticed that only half of his lawn had been mowed. He then found a note from the gardener slipped into his mailbox. The note said:\"Sorry, but I ran out of gas to power the lawn mower and did not have time to buy more gas to finish the job. I'm taking the weekend off, but I will be back Monday morning to finish the job. \"If the man brings suit against the gardener for breach of contract, who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The gardener, because he never accepted the offer made by the man.\nB. The gardener, because he offered to cure the defective performance by finishing the job on Monday morning.\nC. The man, because the gardener's part performance necessarily implied an acceptance and a promise that he would render complete performance.\nD. The man, because under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the gardener's part performance was evidence of his intent to honor the entire contract.\n"

                    "text": "The man's claim against the gardener for breach of contract hinges on the interpretation of the gardener's promise to mow the lawn by Saturday. The key point here is whether the gardener's promise to complete the job by Monday morning was a complete performance of the contract or merely a part performance.\n\n1. **Part Performance vs. Complete Performance**: \n   - **Part Performance**: The gardener's promise to mow the lawn by Saturday was a part performance of the contract. It was a promise to fulfill a specific obligation within a certain timeframe.\n   - **Complete Performance**: The gardener's promise to complete the job by Monday morning was a complete performance of the contract. It was a promise to fulfill the entire obligation of mowing the lawn.\n\n2. **Acceptance and Promise**: \n   - The man's note to the gardener in the mailbox indicates that he did not accept the gardener's part performance (mowing half of the lawn) as a complete performance of the contract. He did not acknowledge the gardener's offer to complete the job by Monday morning.\n\n3. **Equitable Estoppel**: \n   - The doctrine of equitable estoppel suggests that if the gardener's part performance was intended to imply an acceptance and a promise to complete the job, then the man's failure to accept the part performance would be a breach of the contract.\n\nGiven these points, the man is likely to prevail because the gardener's part performance was not a complete performance of the contract. The man's note to the gardener in the mailbox indicates that he did not accept the gardener's part performance as a complete performance of the contract. Therefore, the man's failure to accept the part performance would be a breach of the contract, and the gardener would be held liable for breach.\n\n**Final Answer: C. The man, because the gardener's part performance necessarily implied an acceptance and a promise that he would render complete performance.**"
