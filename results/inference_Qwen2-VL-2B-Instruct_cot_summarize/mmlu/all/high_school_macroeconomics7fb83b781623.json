Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nWhen both expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policies are used simultaneously, the overall effect on the economy is often neutral or even beneficial. This is because the expansionary fiscal policy (e.g., increased government spending or reduced taxes) and the expansionary monetary policy (e.g., increased money supply or lower interest rates) tend to offset each other's effects. This means that the overall impact on the economy is likely to be minimal or even positive, as the two policies are designed to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
