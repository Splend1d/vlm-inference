The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.\n\nIn a contract, a condition precedent is a condition that must be met before the performance of the contract can begin. In this case, the homeowner promised to pay $10,000, which is a condition precedent to the roofer's performance of the contract. The roofer agreed to finish the work within 30 days, which is a condition subsequent to the homeowner's promise to pay."
