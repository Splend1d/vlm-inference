The defendant is compelled to stand trial in street clothing.\n\nIn the context of a trial, due process requires that the defendant be treated fairly and that the proceedings are conducted in a manner that is consistent with the law and the defendant's rights. If the defendant is compelled to stand trial in street clothing, it could be seen as a violation of the defendant's right to a fair trial, as it could be perceived as a form of discrimination or unfair treatment. Therefore, option B would not cause a due process violation in the trial."
