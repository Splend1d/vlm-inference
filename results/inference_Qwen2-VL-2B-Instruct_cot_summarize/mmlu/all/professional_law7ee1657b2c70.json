As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.\nB. No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.\nC. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\nD. Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\n"

Let's analyze each option in detail:\n\nA. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.\n- This statement is irrelevant to the claim. The pedestrian was injured as a result of the truck's failure to slow down, not because he was not a user of the truck. The manufacturer's defect is the key issue.\n\nB. No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.\n- This statement is also irrelevant. The negligence of the farmer is irrelevant to the manufacturer's liability. The manufacturer's defect is the issue.\n\nC. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\n- This statement is relevant. The manufacturer's defect in the truck's brakes is the basis for the claim. The auto dealership is held liable for placing the defective product into the stream of commerce, which is the duty of care owed by the manufacturer.\n\nD. Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\n- This statement is also irrelevant. The manufacturer's defect is the issue, not the dealer's exercise of reasonable care.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce."
