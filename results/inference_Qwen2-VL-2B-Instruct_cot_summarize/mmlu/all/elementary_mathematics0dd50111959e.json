We know that Mike finished the race at 4:02 p.m. and Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike.\n\nFirst, let's convert the time Mike finished the race to a 24-hour format. Mike finished at 4:02 p.m., which is equivalent to 16:02 in 24-hour format.\n\nSince Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike, we subtract 4 minutes from Mike's finish time:\n\n16:02 p.m. - 4 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 4 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 24 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:02 p.m. - 48 minutes = 16:"
