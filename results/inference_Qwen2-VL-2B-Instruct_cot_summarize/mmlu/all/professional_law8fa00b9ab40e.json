She was studying in the law library and decided to take a short refreshment break. When she returned to her study desk ten minutes later, her Primer Series was gone. She ran into the student lounge and announced, \"I will pay $20 to anyone who identifies the dirty bum who took my Primer Series MBE Review books.\"\u009d Donna Doubtful saw Terry Thief pick up Sarah's Primer Series books, but did not believe Sarah would actually pay her the $20, if she made the identification. Thus, Donna went up to Sarah and said, \"I know the identity of the thief and promise to tell you, but I want the $20 in advance.\"\u009d The effect of Donna's statement is to\n\nA. Create a unilateral contract.\nB. Create a bilateral contract.\nC. Create no contract.\nD. Create a contract which is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time.\n"

This is a unilateral offer, as Donna is the one who is offering the money. However, Donna's statement also creates a defeasible contract. If Donna does not make the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time, the offer to pay $20 is no longer binding on Donna."
