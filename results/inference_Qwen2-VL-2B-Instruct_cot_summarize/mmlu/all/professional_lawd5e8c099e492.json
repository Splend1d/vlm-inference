Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is\n\nA. enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.\nB. enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.\nC. unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\nD. unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is enforceable, we need to analyze the principles involved in contract law.\n\n1. **Understanding the Contract**: The original contract was for 100 copies of the casebook at $10 per book. The publisher made an error in the calculation, and the new price should be $11 per book.\n\n2. **Promissory Estoppel**: This principle allows a party to change their mind about a contract after it has been formed. If the new price is higher than the original, the original contract is considered voidable by the party who changed their mind.\n\n3. **Statute of Frauds**: This principle applies when a contract is formed by a person who is not of sound mind or who is under duress or fraud. If the contract is formed under duress or fraud, it is not enforceable.\n\n4. **Error in Calculation**: The error in the calculation is due to a computational error, not a change in the party's mind or under duress.\n\nGiven these points, the key issue is whether the new price of $11 per book is higher than the original price of $10 per book. If it is, then the original contract is voidable by the party who changed their mind.\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the agreement is enforceable because it was not supported by any new consideration. However, the error in the calculation is due to a computational error, not a change in the party's mind or under duress. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option B**: This option suggests that the agreement is enforceable under the principle of promissory estoppel. However, the error in the calculation is due to a computational error, not a change in the party's mind or under duress. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option C**: This option suggests that the agreement is unenforceable because it is violative of the statute of frauds. However, the error in the calculation is due to a computational error, not a change in the party's mind or under duress. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the agreement is unenforceable because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error. This is correct because the error in the calculation is due to a computational error, not a change in the party's mind or under duress.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.**"
