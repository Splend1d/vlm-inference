Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[C(6, 5) = \\frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \\frac{6!}{5!1!}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{6}{1}\\]\n\n\\[= 6\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ways 5 students can be selected from a group of 6 students is 6, which corresponds to option D."
