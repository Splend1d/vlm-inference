They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, \"not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. \"Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in\n\nA. the boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nB. the co-worker and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.\nD. the co-worker as owner in fee simple.\n"

The deed was properly executed and recorded, naming the student and the boyfriend as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n2. The deed purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple, but the co-worker signed the deed without the student's knowledge.\n3. The deed was recorded, and the co-worker paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property.\n4. The deed was executed by the boyfriend, who signed his name and forged the student's name.\n5. The deed was recorded, and the co-worker immediately recorded it.\n\nSince the deed was properly executed and recorded, it is considered valid and enforceable. The deed naming the student and the boyfriend as joint tenants with right of survivorship is valid and enforceable. The deed naming the co-worker as owner in fee simple is also valid and enforceable. Therefore, the property is now in the co-worker's name, but the deed naming the student and the boyfriend as joint tenants with right of survivorship is still valid and enforceable."
