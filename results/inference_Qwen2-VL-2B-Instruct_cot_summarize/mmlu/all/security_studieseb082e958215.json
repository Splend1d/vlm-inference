Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years.\n\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) play a crucial role in the global arms trade by advocating for arms control measures and promoting responsible military spending. They work to educate the public, raise awareness about the negative impacts of arms sales, and advocate for policies that promote peace and security. NGOs also provide technical assistance and support to governments and international organizations in developing and implementing arms control measures."
