The number sentence \\(4 \\times 12 = m\\) directly states that the total number of months, \\(m\\), is equal to \\(4\\) times \\(12\\). \n\nTo express this in a different way, we can use the concept of division. We can divide the total number of months by \\(4\\) to find the number of months per year, and then multiply that by \\(12\\) to find the total number of months. \n\nSo, another way to express the same information is:\n\n\\(m \\div 4 = 12\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct number sentence is:\n\nD. \\(m \\div 4 = 12\\)"
