They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, \"Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?\" The man replied, \"Yes. \" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway. Moments later, the man staggered onto the street and was struck by a car driven by a motorist. He suffered multiple injuries. If the man asserts a claim against the police department based on negligence, he will most likely\n\nA. recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.\nB. recover, because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off.\nC. not recover, because the man chose to be driven to the city limits.\nD. not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.\n"

The man's assertion that the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did is not a valid defense. The police officers were aware that the man was intoxicated and had the option to take him to jail or drive him to the city limits. The man chose to be driven to the city limits, which is a decision that is beyond the control of the police officers. The motorist's act of striking the man is a supervening cause of his injury, which means that it occurred after the police officers had already driven the man to the city limits. Therefore, the man cannot recover against the police department based on negligence."
