Decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach\n\nIncreased risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people in high income countries is primarily due to decreased mobility and little time spent outdoors in the sunshine, which can lead to decreased exposure to sunlight and thus reduced vitamin D production. This is not directly related to intrinsic factor in the stomach, which is a component of the digestive system and not a factor in vitamin or mineral absorption."
