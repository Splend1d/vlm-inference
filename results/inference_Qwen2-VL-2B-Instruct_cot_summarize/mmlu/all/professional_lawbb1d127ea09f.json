He believed that the driver was acting irritable and fidgety, but he had no articulable reason to think anything was wrong. He searched the car anyway and found two cartons of freshly canned peaches, which were owned by the driver's neighbor and reported stolen off of her porch 24 hours earlier. Authorities charged him with theft under the state criminal code. His motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search was denied. On appeal, will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court decision denying the motion to suppress?\n\nA. Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.\nB. Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making any search.\nC. No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.\nD. No, because driver being fidgety is enough for a probable cause full search of the vehicle.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand involves the legality of a police officer's search of a vehicle based on the officer's belief that the driver was acting irritable and fidgety. The key point here is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct the search based on the driver's behavior.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The police officer believed the driver was acting irritable and fidgety, but he had no articulable reason to think anything was wrong. This lack of reasonable suspicion is a critical factor in determining whether the search was constitutional.\n\n2. **Applying the Law**: The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The officer must have a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle contains evidence of a crime before he can conduct a search.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Appeal**: The officer's motion to suppress the evidence was denied by the lower court. This means the lower court believed the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct the search.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the lower court found the officer had reasonable suspicion, the appellate court is unlikely to reverse the decision denying the motion to suppress. The lower court's decision was based on the officer's belief that the driver was acting irritable and fidgety, which was not an unreasonable belief.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop."
