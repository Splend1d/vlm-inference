The cache has a write-through policy, meaning that any write to the cache will be written to memory.\n3. The cache has 2K bytes of capacity, which is 2048 bytes.\n\nSince the cache block size is 8 bytes, and the cache has a write-through policy, any write to the cache will be written to memory. Therefore, during the execution of the loop, all 256 elements of array A will be written to memory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2048"
