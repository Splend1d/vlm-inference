The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect \"unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. \" Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract?\n\nA. The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a \"condition\" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.\nB. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.\nC. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.\nD. The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\n"

The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\n\nThis option directly addresses the contract's condition that the buyer must obtain a loan from a bank to finalize the sale. The owner argues that the buyer's failure to make such a reasonable effort constitutes a breach of the implied promise to act in good faith and in a manner consistent with the contract.\n\nHere's why the other options are less strong:\n\nA. The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a \"condition\" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.\n- This option suggests that the condition was not explicitly stated, but it does not address the owner's argument about the buyer's failure to act in good faith.\n\nB. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.\n- This option suggests that the condition should be excused, but it does not directly address the owner's argument about the buyer's failure to act in good faith.\n\nC. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.\n- This option suggests that the condition should be stricken, but it does not directly address the owner's argument about the buyer's failure to act in good faith.\n\nTherefore, option D is the strongest argument because it directly addresses the owner's claim that the buyer breached an implied promise to act in good faith and in a manner consistent with the contract."
