This service is authorized under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to federal statute. The certificate does not, however, specify particular highways, streets, or locations for the bus service. The company's advertising stresses that it picks up and delivers passengers at the center of each city that it serves. The company's management regards this as a particularly effective advertising point in competition with the airlines and the railroads, because short-haul traffic supplies a major part of the bus company's revenues. One of the major cities on the east coast, acting to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution, has recently enacted an ordinance that prohibits (a) the operation of all trucks and buses in a five- square- mile central business area, known as center city, between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. on weekdays, and (b) all on-street parking of passenger automobiles in center city between the same weekday hours. The company's bus station in this city is located in the heart of the center city area. According to its transportation schedules, more than 75 buses either enter or leave this station between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. each weekday. If the company brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance, the court will most likely declare the ordinance\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.\nB. constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because the ordinance is discriminatory per Se.\n"

                    "text": "The problem involves understanding the relationship between the city's regulation of transportation services and the dormant commerce clause. The city's ordinance prohibits the operation of trucks and buses in the center city area between 10:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. on weekdays, and it also prohibits on-street parking of passenger automobiles in the same area between the same hours. The company's bus station is located in the heart of the center city area, and the company's transportation schedules show that more than 75 buses enter or leave this station during these hours.\n\nThe key point here is that the city's regulation is aimed at regulating intrastate commerce, which is the movement of goods and services within the same state. The dormant commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, states that \"The Congress shall have power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and with the Indian Tribes.\" This clause is designed to protect interstate commerce, which is the movement of goods and services across state lines.\n\nGiven that the city's regulation is aimed at intrastate commerce, it is likely that the court will find the ordinance constitutional. The ordinance is not discriminatory per se, as it is aimed at regulating intrastate commerce. It is also within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district, as it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce."
