The race-notice statute states that if two or more persons claim ownership of the same property at the same time, the first person to record the deed or other legal instrument of title is entitled to the property. The tract index system is a system used to identify and locate properties in a tract or tractage.\n\nIn this scenario, Alice conveyed the property to Barbara, and Barbara did not record the deed. Three years later, Charlene conveyed the property to her, and Charlene recorded the deed. According to the race-notice statute, Charlene would be the first to record the deed, and therefore, the property would be in her name. Therefore, the likely outcome would be for Charlene to be the owner of Greyacre."
