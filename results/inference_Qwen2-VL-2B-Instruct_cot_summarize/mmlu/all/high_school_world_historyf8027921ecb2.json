That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nCrosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.?\n\nA.

It mentions the exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets by Western Europe, which led to their global hegemony.\n\n2. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **A. The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India**: This option is not directly related to the passage's focus on productivity and exploitation of ecosystems and resources.\n   - **B. The beginning of the Industrial Revolution**: The passage does not discuss the Industrial Revolution, which occurred later in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n   - **C. The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans**: This option is relevant because it involves the exploitation of ecosystems and resources, which aligns with the passage's discussion of exploitation of ecosystems and resources.\n   - **D. The increasing development of seafaring technologies**: This option is also relevant, as the passage mentions exploitation of ecosystems and resources, which could involve seafaring technologies.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The passage discusses the exploitation of ecosystems and resources by Western Europe, leading to their global hegemony. This is most closely aligned with the colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans, as it involves the exploitation of ecosystems and resources.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans**"
