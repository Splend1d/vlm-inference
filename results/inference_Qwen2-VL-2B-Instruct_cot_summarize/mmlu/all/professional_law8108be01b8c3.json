The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?\n\nA. Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\nB. Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.\nC. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\nD. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.\n"

                    "text": "The court would likely hold that the mill is entitled to judgment for breach of contract, even though the mill's performance would be discharged by impossibility. This is because the mill's failure to deliver the plywood on time was due to an unforeseeable event (the forest fire), which was beyond their control. The court would likely find that the mill's performance would be discharged by impossibility, which means that the mill's duty to perform would be excused, and the store would be entitled to judgment for breach of contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility."
