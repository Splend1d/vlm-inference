Her family physician had advised her that she was infertile and that it was impossible for her to become pregnant. After missing her period for three months and experiencing other symptoms of pregnancy, the wife consulted the physician. Without administering a pregnancy test, the physician examined the wife and concluded that she had the flu. He prescribed tetracycline, an antibiotic drug, which the wife took for two weeks. After discontinuing the tetracycline, the wife continued to experience nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms of pregnancy. She then consulted a different doctor, who administered a pregnancy test, which revealed that the wife was, in fact, four months pregnant. Thereafter, she gave birth to a child. When the child developed teeth, they were black and discolored. At the age of 12, the child learned that the black discoloration of his teeth resulted from the tetracycline that the wife took during her pregnancy. If a claim is brought on the child's behalf against the physician based on malpractice in not administering a pregnancy test to the woman and prescribing tetracycline, judgment is likely to be for whom?\n\nA. The physician, because an unborn child does not have legal rights stemming from conduct that occurred before birth.\nB. The physician, because no duty of care is owed to an unborn child not in existence at the time medical treatment is rendered.\nC. The child, because a child, if born alive, is permitted to maintain an action for the consequences of prenatal injuries.\nD. The child, because the wife was negligent in failing to seek proper prenatal care.\n"

The child, because a child, if born alive, is permitted to maintain an action for the consequences of prenatal injuries.\n\nWhen a child is born with a condition that is a result of prenatal care, the child has the right to sue for the damages caused by the prenatal care. This right is based on the principle that a child has the capacity to sue for damages that result from prenatal injuries, even if the child is born alive. This principle is known as the doctrine of prematurity, which allows a child born with a condition to sue for damages even if the injury occurred before the child was born.\n\nIn this case, the child was born with black discoloration of his teeth, which is a result of the tetracycline the wife took during her pregnancy. Therefore, the child has the right to sue for the damages caused by the prenatal care, which includes the black discoloration of his teeth."
