Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds. Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields. Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4. Fingers are clubbed. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes.

Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n\nCPAP is a therapy that helps to keep the airways open by applying a positive pressure to the airways, which can help to reduce the severity of the patient's symptoms and improve their overall respiratory function. It is particularly useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other conditions that can cause airway obstruction."
