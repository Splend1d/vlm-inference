Which of the following statements correctly describes a possible outcome of this reaction and why it would occur?\n\nA. Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.\nB. Conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge.\nC. Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\nD. Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\n"

Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.\n\nThis statement is correct because in the process of a positron interacting with a stationary electron, the total mass of the system remains constant. The positron and electron are initially in a state of rest, and their combined mass is equal to the mass of the electron. After the interaction, a new particle is created, and its mass is equal to the sum of the masses of the electron and positron. This is a consequence of the conservation of mass principle, which states that the total mass of a closed system remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
