The consumer did not read the notice and used the machine on a steep hill. As a result, it falls over and crushes him. He sues on a theory of strict liability, alleging a defect in the manufacture of the product. The manufacturer defends that the consumer misused the product. Will the Court likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which the defendant argued renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law?\n\nA. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\nB. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nC. Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.\nD. Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n"

The consumer's negligence (using the lawn mower on a steep hill) is not the focus of the lawsuit; rather, the manufacturer's negligence (not warning the consumer about the danger) is the issue.\n\n2. **Contributory Negligence**: Contributory negligence is a defense to strict liability in product liability cases. It means that the consumer must have contributed to the accident in some way. However, in this case, the consumer did not contribute to the accident; he was simply using the lawn mower on a steep hill.\n\n3. **Warning and Caution**: The consumer did not read the warning, which is a key element of the warning. The warning is a part of the product's design and is intended to warn the consumer about the danger of using the lawn mower on a steep hill. The consumer's failure to read the warning means that the warning was not effective in preventing the accident.\n\n4. **Defective Product**: The manufacturer argues that the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous. This is a defense to strict liability, but it is not the basis for the summary judgment motion. The motion is based on the consumer's failure to read the warning, not the product's defectiveness.\n\nTherefore, the Court will likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law.\n\n**Final Answer: B. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.**"
