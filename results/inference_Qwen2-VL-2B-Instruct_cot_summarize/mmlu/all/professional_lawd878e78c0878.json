The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. What will the appellate court decide?\n\nA.

There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\n\nThe appellate court will likely decide that there is a cause of action because the paramour has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others, even if the woman did not know that he had the disease. The duty to avoid infection arises from the paramour's knowledge of his disease and his responsibility to protect others from contracting it. The wife's knowledge of the paramour's disease does not excuse his duty to prevent transmission. Therefore, the paramour is strictly liable for his negligence in failing to disclose his disease to the woman, and the trial court's dismissal of the complaint is likely an error of law.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. There is a cause of action because one who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to all who contract it.\n   - This option is incorrect because the paramour's negligence is not the sole cause of the wife's infection, and the wife's knowledge of the paramour's disease does not excuse his duty to prevent transmission.\n\nB. There is no cause of action because the wife assumed the risk that the paramour had a sexually transmittable disease.\n   - This option is incorrect because the paramour's negligence is not the sole cause of the wife's infection, and the wife's knowledge of the paramour's disease does not excuse his duty to prevent transmission.\n\nD.
