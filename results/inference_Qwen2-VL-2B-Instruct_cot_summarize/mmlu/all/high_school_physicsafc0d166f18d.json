So, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the initial velocity:\n\nv0 = v - at\n\nWe know that v = 30 m/s and a = -9.8 m/s^2 (negative because it's downward). We can plug in the values to solve for v0:\n\n30 = 30 - (-9.8)t\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = 30 / 9.8 = 3.04 s\n\nNow, we can plug in the values to solve for the height of the cliff:\n\nh = v0 * t\n\nh = 30 * 3.04 = 91.2 m\n\nSo, the cliff was approximately 91.2 meters high. The closest answer to this is:\n\nC. 45 m"
