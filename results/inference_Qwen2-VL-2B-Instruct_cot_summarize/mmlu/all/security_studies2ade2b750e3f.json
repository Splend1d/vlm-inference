In the post-9/11 reversion to traditional security thinking, environmental security as a concept is likely to enjoy continued attention from security analysts and policymakers.\nB. Increasing evidence of the negative effects of environmental insecurity may increasingly govern national security interests and behaviour. The relevance will increase until national unilateralist initiatives are taken to retain the social organization of the nation which may have the adverse affect of increasing the prospect of conflict.\nC. National security practices are the most effective means to achieving environmental security reforms to consolidate the socio-economic organizational base of the country against threat. The state on a practical level remains the most capable body - having the monopolization over the instruments of violence, and centralization of resources - to enter into trans-national agreements for the management of environmental constraints.\nD. The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.\n"

The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.\n\nEnvironmental security is a concept that has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent focus on global security. As environmental problems become more severe and widespread, there is likely to be a growing recognition of the importance of environmental security in national security strategies. This is because environmental security is closely linked to the ability of a country to maintain its social and economic stability, as well as its ability to protect its citizens from the impacts of environmental degradation.\n\nMultilateral action on common security concerns is likely to play a significant role in achieving environmental security. This is because environmental problems are often interconnected and require coordinated efforts to address. By working together on common security concerns, countries can help to create a more sustainable and equitable global order, which is essential for achieving environmental security.\n\nCurrent practices of national security, such as military intervention and economic sanctions, may be seen as an impediment to achieving environmental security. This is because these practices can have negative impacts on the environment and can lead to conflicts and instability. By focusing on multilateral action on common security concerns, countries can work together to address environmental problems and create a more sustainable and equitable global order."
