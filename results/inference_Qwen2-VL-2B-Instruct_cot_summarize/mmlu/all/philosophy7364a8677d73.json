Singer's theory is designed to be a minimalistic approach to moral philosophy, aiming to simplify moral reasoning and reduce the complexity of moral dilemmas. By requiring a drastic revision to our moral scheme, this objection argues that Singer's theory is not a viable option for addressing moral issues."
