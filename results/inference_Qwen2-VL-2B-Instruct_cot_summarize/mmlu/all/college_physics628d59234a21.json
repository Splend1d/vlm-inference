In this case, the meter stick is moving past the observer, so the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer is equal to the time it takes for the stick to cover the distance between the observer and the stick.\n\nThe speed of the meter stick is 0.8c, so the distance it covers is 0.8c * distance between the observer and the meter stick. The time it takes for the stick to pass the observer is equal to the distance it covers divided by the speed of the meter stick.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer is:\n\nt = (0.8c * distance between the observer and the meter stick) / c\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nt = (0.8 * 10^8 m/s * distance between the observer and the meter stick) / 10^8 m/s\n\nt = distance between the observer and the meter stick\n\nSince the distance between the observer and the meter stick is not given, we cannot determine the exact value of t. However, we can say that the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer is equal to the distance between the observer and the meter stick.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 4.2 ns"
