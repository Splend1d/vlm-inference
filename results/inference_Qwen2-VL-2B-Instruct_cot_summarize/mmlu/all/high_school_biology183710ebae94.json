The dead zones result from the rapid growth of photosynthetic phytoplankton (algal blooms) and their subsequent decay by oxygen-depleting microbes in the water column. Which of the following factors most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones?\n\nA. A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months\n"

A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\n\nAlgal blooms and dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico are primarily caused by the influx of nutrients from human activities, particularly from the Mississippi River and other sources. These nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, are essential for the growth of phytoplankton, which are the primary producers in the water column. When these nutrients are abundant, they can lead to an overgrowth of phytoplankton, which can then decompose rapidly, releasing oxygen and nutrients back into the water column, leading to oxygen depletion and the formation of dead zones."
