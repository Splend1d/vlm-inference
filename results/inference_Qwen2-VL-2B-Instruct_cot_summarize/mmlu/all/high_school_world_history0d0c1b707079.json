If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nHow would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany?\n\nA.

It also mentions the usual help for the poor and its shortcomings in large cities.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.\"\n     - This option suggests that Keynes would advocate for government intervention to address the economic insecurity faced by workers. However, the passage does not mention Keynes' recommendation for government intervention in maintaining aggregate demand.\n   - **Option B**: \"Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances.\"\n     - This option aligns with Keynes' view that the government should not intervene in most circumstances, as it would not recognize any real obligation towards workers beyond the usual help for the poor. This is consistent with Keynes' argument that the usual help for the poor is inadequate.\n   - **Option C**: \"Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters.\"\n     - This option suggests that Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters, which is not mentioned in the passage.\n   - **Option D**: \"Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities.\"\n     - This option suggests that Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was more severe than it was in cities. However, the passage does not provide any information about the severity of poverty in rural areas compared to cities.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most accurate interpretation of how twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes would suggest society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany is:\n\n**B. Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances.**"
