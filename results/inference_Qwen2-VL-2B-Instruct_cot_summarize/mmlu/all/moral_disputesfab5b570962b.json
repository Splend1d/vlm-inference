The core of the question is to determine why Wellman's argument is insufficient, given the egalitarian objection that states should not exclude outsiders without a specific reason.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Egalitarians are committed to utilitarian principles.**\n   - This option suggests that Wellman's response is insufficient because it does not align with the utilitarian principles of egalitarians. However, this does not directly address the flaw in Wellman's argument.\n\nB. **Wellman himself is an immigrant.**\n   - This option implies that Wellman's personal background might influence his perspective, but it does not directly address the flaw in his argument.\n\nC. **Excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.**\n   - This option suggests that Wellman's response is insufficient because it does not consider the potential harm that may result from excluding people who have specific interests or reasons for wanting to be part of the state. This is a valid concern, but it does not directly address the flaw in Wellman's argument.\n\nD. **The concept of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory.**\n   - This option suggests that Wellman's argument is insufficient because it does not consider the internal consistency of the concept of \"exporting justice.\" This is a valid concern, but it does not directly address the flaw in Wellman's argument.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the flaw in Wellman's argument is that it does not sufficiently address the potential harm that may result from excluding people who have specific interests or reasons for wanting to be part of the state. This is a valid concern, but it does not directly address the flaw in Wellman's argument.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**C. Excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.**"
