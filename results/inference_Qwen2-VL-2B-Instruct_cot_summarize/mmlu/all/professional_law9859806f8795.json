After telling his employer by phone that he was going for lunch and getting approval, he pulled into the entrance of a restaurant where he intended to have his usual 30- minute lunch break. While entering the parking lot, the driver carelessly ran over and seriously injured a pedestrian. The injured person sued the driver and the driver's employer for negligence in causing her injuries. Is the employer liable?\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n"

No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n\nIn the context of negligence, liability cannot be imputed from one person to another. This principle is known as the doctrine of respondeat superior, which states that an employer is not liable for the actions of its employees unless the employee's actions were within the scope of their employment. In this case, the injured pedestrian was not within the scope of the employee's employment, as the employee was not acting in the course of his employment when he ran over the pedestrian. Therefore, the employer cannot be held liable for the employee's actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
