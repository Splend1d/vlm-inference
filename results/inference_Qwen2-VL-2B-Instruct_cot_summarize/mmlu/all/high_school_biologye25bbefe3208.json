All organisms use essentially the same genetic code.\n\nThis evidence strongly supports the common origin of all life on Earth because it suggests that the genetic code is a fundamental characteristic that all living organisms share, regardless of their specific evolutionary history. The genetic code is a universal feature of life, and its conservation across different species indicates that it was present in the earliest forms of life and has remained unchanged over time."
