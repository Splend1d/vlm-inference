He says, \"I cannot go more than a day without cigarettes because I get so anxious and irritable. I even wake up at night to smoke.\" The patient began smoking cigarettes at age 12 years; he was smoking two packs of cigarettes daily by age 17 years, and he has not curtailed his use since that time. He does not drink alcoholic beverages or use illicit drugs. Medical history is remarkable for childhood febrile seizures. He takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy because he says his friend found the treatments to be helpful. In combining these two therapies, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following?\n\nA. Hypertension\nB. Polyuria\nC. Renal insufficiency\nD. The patient is at no increased risk\n"

Renal insufficiency\n\nThe patient's history of childhood febrile seizures and his current use of bupropion therapy, which is a medication used to treat seizures, increases the risk of renal insufficiency. Bupropion can cause kidney damage, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those who are taking other medications that can increase the risk of kidney damage. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for renal insufficiency."
