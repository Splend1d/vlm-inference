The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage discusses the 1864 election, focusing on the reasons behind the opposition of Radical Republicans to Lincoln's re-election.\n\n2. **Core of the Question**: The question asks for the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **A. Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.**\n     - This option suggests that the Emancipation Proclamation was not a legitimate action taken by Lincoln, which could be seen as a violation of the Republican Party's principles. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the Emancipation Proclamation was not a legitimate action. It only mentions that it was done without congressional oversight.\n   \n   - **B. The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.**\n     - This option suggests that the Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation, but Lincoln did not agree. However, the passage does not provide any information about the Radicals' specific demands or Lincoln's refusal to cooperate.\n   \n   - **C. Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.**\n     - This option implies that Lincoln's plan did not guarantee black suffrage, which could be seen as a significant issue for the Radicals. However, the passage does not provide any information about the Ten Percent Plan or its impact on suffrage.\n   \n   - **D. Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.**\n     - This option suggests that the appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president was a conflict with the Senate's Reconstruction goals. However, the passage does not provide any information about the conflict between Lincoln and the Senate regarding Johnson's appointment.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: After analyzing each option, it is clear that none of the provided options directly addresses the specific reasons why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861. The passage does not provide any information about the Radicals' specific demands or Lincoln's refusal to cooperate.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861 is:\n\n**B. The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.**"
