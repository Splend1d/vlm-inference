It requires that any archaeological research on sites with human remains of indigenous North American ancestors be conducted by archaeologists who are Native American or who have been trained in Native American archaeology. This is to ensure that the remains are properly cared for and that any information gathered is used for the benefit of the indigenous community.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. there are no Native Americans who have been trained as archaeologists and no archaeologists who are Native American."
