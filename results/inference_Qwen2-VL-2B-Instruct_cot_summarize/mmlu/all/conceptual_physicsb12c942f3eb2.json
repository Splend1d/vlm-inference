This is because the tuning fork and the piano string produce beats at a frequency that is the difference between their frequencies. In this case, the difference between the frequencies of the tuning fork and the piano string is 1 Hz, which is the frequency of the beats. Therefore, the frequency of the piano string is the sum of the frequencies of the tuning fork and the piano string, which is 1134 Hz. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 1134 Hz."
