One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire onto a truck by himself, he experienced a sharp and excruciating pain in his lower back. He did not report the incident to his employer, but continued to work. A week later, after work, he went to the doctor for treatment. The man then sues his employer, alleging that the employer failed to provide him with adequate assistance, safety equipment, and training to load heavy tractor tires, thereby contributing to his injury. The employer alleges that the man is merely trying to obtain compensation for an old back injury, unrelated to his employment. At trial, the man's doctor testified that the man told her that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck. The doctor's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as expert testimony.\nB. admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.\nC. inadmissible as a violation of the physicianpatient privilege.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Hearsay testimony is not admissible in court unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions, such as a statement made under oath or a statement made in the course of a legal proceeding. In this case, the doctor's testimony is not a statement made under oath or in a legal proceeding, and it is not a statement made in the course of a legal proceeding. Therefore, it is inadmissible as hearsay."
