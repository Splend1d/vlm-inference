The likelihood of the data increases with the number of hidden states, but it does not increase linearly. The likelihood increases exponentially with the number of hidden states. Therefore, increasing the number of hidden states does not necessarily increase the likelihood of the data.\n\nStatement 2: Collaborative filtering is often a useful model for modeling users' movie preference.\n\nThis statement is true. Collaborative filtering is a popular technique used in recommendation systems to predict the preferences of users based on the preferences of other users. It is often used in various applications such as movie recommendation, music recommendation, and more."
