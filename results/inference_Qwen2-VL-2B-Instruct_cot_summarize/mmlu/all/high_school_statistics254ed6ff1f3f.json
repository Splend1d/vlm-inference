The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated as:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the score, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor a score of 740:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(740 - 650)}{45} = \\frac{90}{45} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of applicants with scores below 740. This is the area under the normal distribution curve to the left of z = 2. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this percentage.\n\nLooking up z = 2 in a standard normal distribution table, we find that the area to the left of z = 2 is approximately 0.9772.\n\nTo find the percentage of applicants with scores below 740, we multiply this area by 100:\n\n\\[ 0.9772 \\times 100 = 97.72 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n\\[ 97.72 \\approx 98 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of applicants with scores below 740 is approximately 98%, which corresponds to option D."
