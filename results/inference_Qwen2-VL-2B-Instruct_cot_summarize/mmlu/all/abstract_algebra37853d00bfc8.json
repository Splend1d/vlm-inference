In other words, it is the number of ways to choose an element from \\(H\\) and multiply it with all the elements of \\(G\\) to get an element in \\(H\\).\n\nFor the subgroup \\(<p>\\) of \\(S_5\\), where \\(p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3)\\), we can find the index of \\(<p>\\) in \\(S_5\\) by considering the number of distinct ways to choose an element from \\(<p>\\) and multiplying it with all the elements of \\(S_5\\) to get an element in \\(<p>\\).\n\nThe subgroup \\(<p>\\) consists of all the permutations of the elements of \\(S_5\\) that fix the element \\(p\\). Since \\(p\\) is a transposition, it fixes all the elements except for itself. Therefore, the subgroup \\(<p>\\) consists of all the permutations of \\(S_5\\) that fix the element \\(p\\).\n\nThe number of permutations of \\(S_5\\) that fix the element \\(p\\) is \\(5!\\), which is \\(120\\).\n\nTherefore, the index of \\(<p>\\) in \\(S_5\\) is \\(120\\), which corresponds to option D."
