This means that $a$ must be at least 1, and $b$ must be at least 1 as well. The smallest possible value for $a$ is 1, and the smallest possible value for $b$ is 1. Therefore, the smallest possible value for $n$ is $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$. However, this does not contain the digit 9. The next smallest possible value for $n$ is $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 250$. This does contain the digit 9, and it is the smallest positive integer $n$ that meets the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{256}$."
