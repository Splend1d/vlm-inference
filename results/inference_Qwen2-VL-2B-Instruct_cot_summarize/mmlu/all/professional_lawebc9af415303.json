At the stationhouse, the man told a police officer that he was prepared to make a confession. The police officer then turned on a video recorder and videotaped the man's confession. At trial, the prosecution called the police officer to testify to the incriminating statements that the man made in his confession. Upon objection by the man's attorney, the police officer's proposed testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nC. admissible, because the police officer had firsthand knowledge of the confession.\nD. admissible, because the man was given his Miranda rights before the confession was elicited.\n"
