Therefore, \\( 0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1 \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( x \\).\n\nStatement 2 is False, because the concept of decision tree learning is not directly related to minimizing information gain. Information gain is a measure used in machine learning to evaluate the quality of a split in a decision tree, but it is not the primary focus of decision tree learning. The primary goal of decision tree learning is to create a model that can make predictions based on the data, and minimizing information gain is a technique used to achieve this goal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
