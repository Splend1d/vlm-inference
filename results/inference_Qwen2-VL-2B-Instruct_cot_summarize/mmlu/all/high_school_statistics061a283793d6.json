The t-test is used to compare the means of two groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. \n\nGiven that the college admissions officer is comparing SAT math scores of applicants who took AP Statistics with those who did not, we need to ensure that the variances of the two groups are equal. This is because the t-test assumes that the variances are equal for the two groups to be valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The population variances from the two groups are equal."
