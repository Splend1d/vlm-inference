She is best known for her work on the concept of cultural relativism, which suggests that cultural norms and values are not universal but are instead shaped by the unique circumstances of each society. \n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined.\n- This statement is consistent with Mead's views on cultural relativism. She believed that cultural norms and values are shaped by the unique circumstances of each society, and that gender roles and adolescence are influenced by cultural contexts.\n\nB. Gender roles in three New Guinea societies were identical and so must be biologically determined.\n- This statement is not consistent with Mead's views. She argued that gender roles and other cultural norms are shaped by the unique circumstances of each society, not by biological determinants.\n\nC. Adolescence in the USA is a time of relative calm compared to the experience in Japan and Europe.\n- This statement is not consistent with Mead's views. She believed that cultural norms and values are shaped by the unique circumstances of each society, not by a comparison to other societies.\n\nD. Anthropological fieldwork can be problematic because the researcher's values affect the way they interpret their observations.\n- This statement is consistent with Mead's views. She believed that anthropological fieldwork can be problematic because the researcher's values and biases can influence the interpretation of their observations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined."
