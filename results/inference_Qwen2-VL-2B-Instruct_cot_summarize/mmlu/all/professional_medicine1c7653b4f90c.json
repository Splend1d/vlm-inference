Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?\n\nA. Eustachian tube dysfunction\nB. Mucosal edema\nC. Nasal polyps\nD. Oral contraceptive use\n"

Nasal polyps\n\nNasal polyps are benign growths of tissue that can cause nasal obstruction and inflammation. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, allergies, and infections. In this case, the patient's symptoms of nasal stuffiness, rhinorrhea, and sore throat are consistent with nasal polyps. The presence of enlarged tonsils and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors also suggests a possible underlying cause of sinusitis, such as a bacterial infection or allergy. The patient's BMI and lack of smoking history also suggest that oral contraceptive use is not the primary cause of her sinusitis."
