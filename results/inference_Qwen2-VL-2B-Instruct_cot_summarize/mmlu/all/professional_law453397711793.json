On May 1, the owner sold the tract to a buyer for the purchase price of $40,000 under a quitclaim deed. The owner delivered the deed to the buyer who did not record the deed. After the sale to the buyer, the owner found himself in desperate need of money because he lost his job. So the owner, in consideration of the sum of $75,000, conveyed the tract to an investor by warranty deed. This transaction took place on August 1. When the investor acquired title to the tract, he had no actual knowledge of the buyer's deed (which was still unrecorded). On August 10, the buyer recorded his deed to the tract. The investor did not record the deed he received from the owner until August 15. In an appropriate action to quiet title to the tract, in which all interested parties have been joined, title will be found to be in\n\nA. the buyer, because his deed preceded the investor's deed.\nB. the buyer, because his deed was recorded prior to the investor's deed.\nC. the investor, because he is protected by the recording statute.\nD. the investor, because he took title by warranty deed and the buyer took title by quitclaim deed.\n"

In this case, the buyer's deed was recorded before the investor's deed, which means that the investor's deed is not valid against subsequent purchasers. Therefore, the investor's deed will be found to be in default and will be voided. The buyer's deed, on the other hand, was recorded after the investor's deed, so it will be valid and will be considered to be in title to the tract."
