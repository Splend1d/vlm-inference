Reports of the drug being tied to cases of premature dementia surfaced, and a number of lawsuits were filed by injured consumers, alleging strict liability for a defective product. At trial, the manufacturer proved that thorough testing was done but that new scientific discoveries, not then available, now show a vulnerability in certain people to the drug. Is the company strictly liable to the victims even though the medical knowledge was not available when the product was developed and put on the market?\n\nA. Yes, strict liability applies to pharmaceutical companies and questions of knowledge of defects is irrelevant.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer must assume the cost of compensating those innocent victims who took the defective drug.\nC. No, the company has no duty to conduct research to determine a product's safety.\nD.

No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n\nStrict liability is a legal doctrine that holds the manufacturer strictly liable for any defects in a product, regardless of whether the manufacturer knew about the defect at the time of manufacture. However, when new scientific discoveries become available that reveal a vulnerability in the product, the manufacturer may be held strictly liable for the defect if the manufacturer had knowledge of the vulnerability at the time of manufacture.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer has proven that thorough testing was done but that new scientific discoveries, not then available, now show a vulnerability in certain people to the drug. This means that the manufacturer had knowledge of the vulnerability at the time of manufacture, and therefore, the manufacturer is strictly liable for the defect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
