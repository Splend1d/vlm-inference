However, they should not be used as the sole source of information. The psychologist should always supplement the computerized results with other information obtained during the assessment, such as the client's history, current symptoms, and other relevant data. This approach helps to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the client's psychological state and allows for a more nuanced interpretation of the results."
