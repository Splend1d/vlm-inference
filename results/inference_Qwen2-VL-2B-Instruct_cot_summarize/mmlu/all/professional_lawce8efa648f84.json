While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that \"she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor.\" After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: \"The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' \". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?\n\nA. Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n"

In this case, the declarant is the building owner, and the declarant's statement is about a statement made to them by the janitor.\n\nThe declarant's statement is likely to be held admissible because it is a declarant's statement against interest, which is a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. The declarant's statement is not hearsay because it is not a statement made to an opponent-party, but rather a statement made to the declarant by the declarant's opponent, the janitor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply."
