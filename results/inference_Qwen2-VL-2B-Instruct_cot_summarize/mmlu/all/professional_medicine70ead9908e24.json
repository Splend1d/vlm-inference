Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase\nB. Ca2+ channels\nC. Janus kinase\nD. Serine kinase\n"

Adenylyl cyclase is a enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP (cyclic AMP), which is a second messenger that activates protein kinase A. This activation of protein kinase A leads to the phosphorylation of various proteins, including those involved in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase"
