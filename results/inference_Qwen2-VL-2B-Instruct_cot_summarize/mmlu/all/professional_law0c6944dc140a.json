The homeowner paid the contractor only $20,000, truthfully saying that she did not like the finish on the cabinets and was therefore not satisfied. If the contractor sues the homeowner for the balance of the contract price, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay was not satisfied.\nB. No, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials.\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract.\n"

The homeowner paid only $20,000, which was less than the $25,000 contract price. This means that the homeowner did not satisfy the condition of the contract, which is that she must be satisfied with the work done.\n\nTherefore, the homeowner breached the contract by not being satisfied with the work done. This breach of contract is a valid reason for the contractor to sue the homeowner for the balance of the contract price.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification."
