Calling in sick without a legitimate medical reason is a form of dishonesty and can be seen as a violation of trust and honesty.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character wore a mask to the store because they didn't want to be caught taking merchandise. This is a morally neutral action. Wearing a mask is a personal choice and does not inherently involve any moral wrongdoings. It is a matter of personal preference and does not impact others in any significant way."
