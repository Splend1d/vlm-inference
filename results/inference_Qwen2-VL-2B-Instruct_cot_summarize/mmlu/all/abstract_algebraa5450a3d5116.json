A free abelian group is a group that is not finitely generated, meaning it has an infinite number of elements. Therefore, it cannot be torsion free, as torsion-free groups are defined to have a finite number of elements.\n\nStatement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\nThis statement is true. A finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a group that is both torsion-free and has a finite number of elements. Since torsion-free groups are free, it follows that the group is also free.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
