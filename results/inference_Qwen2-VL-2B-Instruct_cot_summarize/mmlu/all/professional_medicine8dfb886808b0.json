During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?\n\nA. Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule\nB. Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone\nC. Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally\nD. Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam\n"

Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule\n\nThis option is the most appropriate because it acknowledges the patient's concerns about addiction while also providing reassurance that the morphine is being used to manage her pain effectively. It also avoids the use of potentially addictive medications like intravenous naloxone or intramuscular lorazepam, which are not indicated for pain management in this scenario."
