Both teams were staying at the same hotel. The assistant coach of one of the teams learned that the team captain of the other team was staying in the next room. In order to obtain information about the other team's strategy for the championship game, the assistant coach used electronic devices placed against the wall to listen to and record conversations between the team captain and his teammates. The assistant coach later bragged to others about having eavesdropped on the team captain, and the team captain eventually heard about what the assistant coach had done. If the team captain asserts a claim against the assistant coach for invasion of privacy, will the team captain prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the assistant coach was recording the conversation for the use and advantage of his team.\nB. Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\nC. No, because the assistant coach's electronic devices did not physically intrude into the team captain's room.\nD. No, because there was publication of the recorded conversations.\n"

This expectation arises from the fact that he is in a private space and the recording of conversations is a breach of that expectation.\n\n2. **Electronic Devices and Invasion of Privacy**: The assistant coach used electronic devices to record conversations, which is a clear invasion of privacy. The use of electronic devices to record conversations is generally considered a violation of privacy rights.\n\n3. **Reasonable Expectation of Privacy**: The team captain's expectation of privacy is reasonable because he is in a private room and the recording of conversations is a significant intrusion into his personal space.\n\nGiven these points, the team captain has a valid claim for invasion of privacy. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.**"
