This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves using the police to enforce personal property rights without just cause. In scenario 2, the main character went to their parents' safe deposit box without permission. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a private matter and does not involve the use of force or harm to others."
