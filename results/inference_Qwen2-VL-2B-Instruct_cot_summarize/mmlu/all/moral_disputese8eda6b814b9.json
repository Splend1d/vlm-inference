                    "text": "The principle Arthur calls \"the greater moral evil rule\" is a concept from moral philosophy that suggests that certain actions or behaviors are inherently more harmful or evil than others. This principle is often used to argue that certain actions or behaviors are morally wrong or unethical, even if they are not necessarily illegal or harmful in the traditional sense.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. People are entitled to keep their earnings only if there is no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away.\n- This option suggests that people should not give away their earnings because it might lead to a greater evil. This aligns with the principle of the greater moral evil rule, as it argues that certain actions are inherently more harmful than others.\n\nB. Being rich is a great moral evil, and as such we should all strive to live on a moderate income.\n- This option suggests that being rich is a moral evil, but it does not directly address the principle of the greater moral evil rule. It is more about the moral value of wealth rather than the principle itself.\n\nC. Two moral evils do not make a moral good.\n- This option suggests that the combination of two moral evils does not result in a moral good. This is a general principle about the nature of moral evil, but it does not directly address the principle of the greater moral evil rule.\n\nD. Morality itself is a great evil.\n- This option suggests that morality is inherently evil, which is a strong statement about the nature of morality itself. It does not directly address the principle of the greater moral evil rule.\n\nBased on the analysis, the principle of the greater moral evil rule is best captured by option A. People are entitled to keep their earnings only if there is no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away.\n\nFinal answer: A. People are entitled to keep their earnings only if there is no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away."
