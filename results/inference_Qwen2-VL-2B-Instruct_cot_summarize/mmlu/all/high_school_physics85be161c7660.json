The conservation of momentum equation is:\n\n\\[ m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = m_1v_1' + m_2v_2' \\]\n\nwhere \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the two objects, \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are the initial velocities of the two objects, and \\( v_1' \\) and \\( v_2' \\) are the final velocities of the two objects.\n\nThe conservation of energy equation is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} m_1v_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2v_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_1v_1'^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2v_2'^2 \\]\n\nTo determine the mass of the second object, you would need to know either the final speed of object 1 (\\( v_1' \\)) or the final speed of object 2 (\\( v_2' \\)). If you know both, you can solve for the mass of the second object using the conservation of momentum equation. If you know only one, you can use the conservation of energy equation to solve for the mass of the second object."
