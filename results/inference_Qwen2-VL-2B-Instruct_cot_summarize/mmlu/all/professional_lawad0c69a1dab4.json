He arrested her for driving while under suspension and secured her in the rear seat of the squad car. He then searched the car where he found several bags of cocaine inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat; he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Initial Traffic Stop**: The driver was stopped for speeding, and the officer found her license suspended. This led to the arrest for driving while under suspension. The officer then searched the car, finding the bags of cocaine.\n\n2. **Suppression Motion**: The driver moved for suppression of the cocaine, arguing that the search was unreasonable and warrantless.\n\n3. **Suppression Doctrine**: The doctrine of unreasonable searches and seizures is applicable here. The search was conducted without a warrant, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nGiven these points, the trial court is likely to grant the suppression motion. The court will likely find that the search was unreasonable and warrantless, thus invalidating the discovery of the cocaine.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nB. No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest."
