On August 1, the widower handed his friend a deed conveying the quarry to his niece and said to the friend, \"Give this to my niece. \" Unknown to the widower, the niece was in Africa. The next week, the friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. One month later, the widower died, and in his will he devised the quarry to his daughter. Thereafter, the niece returned from Africa, and a dispute arose between the niece and the daughter regarding ownership of the quarry. In a suit to quiet title to the quarry, the court ruled in favor of the niece. The ruling was most likely based upon which of the following?\n\nA. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\nB. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\nC. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.\nD. The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated.\n"

The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Causa Mortis Gift**: This refers to a gift made before the donor's death. In this case, the deed was given to the niece before she left for Africa. This would not be considered a \"causa mortis\" gift because the deed was given before the death of the donor.\n\n2. **Effective Delivery**: The deed was given to the niece, and the friend recorded it with the Recorder's Office. This means that the deed was delivered to the niece and then recorded, which is the effective delivery.\n\n3. **Effective Deed**: The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated. This means that the deed was recorded before the will was executed, which is the effective time for the devise to take effect.\n\n4. **Effect of Recording**: Recording the deed with the Recorder's Office is a legal process that confirms the transfer of ownership. It is not a legal requirement for the deed to be effective, but it is a necessary step to ensure that the deed is recognized as the transfer of ownership.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely reason for the ruling in favor of the niece is that the deed was effectively delivered and recorded before the devise was effectuated, which is the legal requirement for the devise to take effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed."
