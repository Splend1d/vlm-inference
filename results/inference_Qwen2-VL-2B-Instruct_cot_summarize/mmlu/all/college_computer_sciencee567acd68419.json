In this case, the program is inherently sequential, meaning it will not benefit from additional processors.\n\n2. **Execution Time Calculation**:\n   - **Single Processor**: The program takes 100 seconds to execute.\n   - **2 Processors**: Since the program is inherently sequential, it will not benefit from additional processors. Therefore, the time remains the same, 100 seconds.\n   - **4 Processors**: The program is inherently sequential, so it will not benefit from additional processors. Therefore, the time remains the same, 100 seconds.\n\n3. **Theoretically Best Possible Elapsed Times**:\n   - **2 Processors**: Since the program is inherently sequential, it will not benefit from additional processors. Therefore, the time remains the same, 100 seconds.\n   - **4 Processors**: The program is inherently sequential, so it will not benefit from additional processors. Therefore, the time remains the same, 100 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the theoretically best possible elapsed times for the program running with 2 and 4 processors are both 100 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**D. 70 and 55 seconds**"
