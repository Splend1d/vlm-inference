However, the loss is $90, not $20. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10**:\n   - This option suggests that Jason should shut down in the short run with a loss of $10. However, the loss is $90, not $10. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $20**:\n   - This option suggests that Jason should clean 9 pools per day with a loss of $20. However, the loss is $90, not $20. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10**:\n   - This option suggests that Jason should clean 9 pools per day with a loss of $10. This matches the calculated loss of $90, indicating that this option is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10."
