About 68% of the individuals with a given cure score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score.\n\nThis is because the standard error of measurement (SEM) represents the variability of the measurement process. It tells us how much the observed scores can vary from the true score. If the SEM is 15 points, it means that about 68% of the individuals with a given cure score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score. This is a common interpretation of the SEM in psychological testing and research."
