The median is the middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in order. If there is an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nGiven Sarah's times for her first five attempts are 86, 94, 97, 88, and 96, we can arrange these times in ascending order to find the median. The times are 86, 88, 94, 96, and 97. Since there are an odd number of numbers (5), the median is the third number in the ordered list, which is 94 seconds.\n\nAfter her sixth attempt, the median time became 92 seconds. This means that the sixth attempt time must be less than 92 seconds to bring the median down to 92 seconds.\n\nGiven the options, the only time that fits this criterion is 90 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 90."
