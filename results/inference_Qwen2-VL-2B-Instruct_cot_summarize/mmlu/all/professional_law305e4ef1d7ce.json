An organization of influential city residents began an intensive lobbying effort to persuade the city council to deny the owner a permit to operate any type of nude- dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city. The owner has sued the city in an appropriate federal court, seeking an injunction that would prohibit the city council from considering the organization's views, on the ground that if the organization is successful in its lobbying efforts, the owner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated. The city has moved to dismiss the action. Should the court dismiss the owner's action?\n\nA. No, because nude dancing is symbolic speech and is therefore protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nB. No, because the organization does not seek a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of nude dancing, but instead seeks a total ban on the owner's opening any type of nude-dancing facility at any time or in any place in the city.\nC. Yes, because the action is not ripe.\nD. Yes, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect obscenity, and nude dancing is obscene.\n"

The owner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights are not protected by the city's zoning permit application, which is a regulation of the owner's business activities, not a regulation of the owner's speech. The organization's lobbying effort to ban the owner's business is not a reasonable time, place, or manner regulation of the owner's business activities, but rather a total ban on the owner's business. Therefore, the organization's views cannot be considered in the zoning permit application, and the owner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights are not violated by the city's zoning permit application."
