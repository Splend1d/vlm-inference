However, the actions themselves are morally ambiguous. In Scenario 1, feeding the kitten to the dog is generally considered morally wrong because it involves treating the kitten as a food source, which is not appropriate behavior towards an animal. In Scenario 2, putting a hook in the cat's mouth is also morally wrong, as it involves causing harm to the cat by preventing it from escaping. Therefore, the main character's actions in both scenarios are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
