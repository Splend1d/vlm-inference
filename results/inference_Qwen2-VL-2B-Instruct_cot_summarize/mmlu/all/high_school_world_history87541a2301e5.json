The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n"

This implies that the Mongol conquest did not lead to the exclusion of Russia from Western European developments like the Renaissance. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nThe passage also mentions that the Mongol domains were well-policed and served as a bridge between civilizations. This suggests that the Mongols did not simply become the administrative center of Mongol political activity. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nThe passage states that the Mongol domains facilitated the spread of foods and inventions from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. This implies that the Mongols did not simply develop a centralized bureaucracy. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nThe passage does not provide information about the spread of Islam in Russia. Therefore, option C is not supported by the given information.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity."
