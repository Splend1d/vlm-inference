To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?\n\nA. The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\nB. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\nC. They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.\nD. They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the best supposition about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual, let's analyze the context and the reasoning provided in the given passages.\n\n1. **William Bentinck's Passage:**\n   - The passage discusses the practice of sati, which involves the ritual of immolation of a woman's body after her husband's death. Bentinck argues that the British government should suppress this practice because it is an inhumane act that endangers innocent victims.\n   - The passage concludes with a recommendation for an open and general prohibition, suggesting that the British government should take a more cautious approach initially but eventually adopt a more aggressive stance.\n\n2. **George Simpson's Passage:**\n   - Simpson discusses the relationship between the British and the Indians, stating that the British should rule the Indians with a rod of iron to maintain their subordination and ensure their proper state of subordination.\n   - Simpson's passage implies that the British government should use force to maintain control over the Indians, suggesting a more aggressive approach.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Option A: The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.**\n   - This option suggests that the British government's motivation was to convert the Indian Hindu population to Christianity. However, the passage does not mention any plans to convert the Indians to Christianity. Instead, it discusses the suppression of sati and the need to maintain control over the Indians.\n\n- **Option B: The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.**\n   - This option aligns well with the passage's recommendation for a more cautious approach initially and then an open and general prohibition. It suggests that the British government's motivation was to end the sati ritual without compromising their authority.\n\n- **Option C: They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.**\n   - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss any progressive concerns for women's equality.\n\n- **Option D: They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.**\n   - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention any racial prejudice or disdain for Indian customs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the best supposition about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual is that they sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.**"
