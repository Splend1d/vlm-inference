It has a specific affinity for oxygen, which is why it is called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is influenced by the concentration of oxygen in the blood and the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). When the concentration of oxygen in the blood is high, hemoglobin binds more tightly to oxygen, making it less available to bind to CO2. Conversely, when the concentration of oxygen in the blood is low, hemoglobin binds more tightly to CO2, making it less available to bind to oxygen.\n\nIn exercising muscle tissue, the concentration of oxygen in the blood is high, so hemoglobin binds more tightly to oxygen. This increased affinity for oxygen allows hemoglobin to transport more oxygen to the muscles, which is essential for muscle contraction and energy production."
