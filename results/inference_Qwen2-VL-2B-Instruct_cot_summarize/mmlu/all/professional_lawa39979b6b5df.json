The parties entered into a contract whereby the seller agreed to deliver to the buyer 1,000 flanges for $10,000. The contract stipulated that it was FOB at the seller's place of business. The seller then delivered the flanges to a delivery company, which was to transport them to the buyer. While en route, the vehicle that was transporting the flanges was involved in an accident and the flanges were destroyed. When the buyer received notice of the accident, the buyer immediately contacted the seller and demanded that it ship replacement flanges. The seller refused to do so. In an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract, the buyer will\n\nA. succeed, because the risk of loss was on the seller.\nB. succeed, because the carrier was the seller's agent.\nC. not succeed, because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\nD. not succeed, because of frustration of purpose.\n"

The key point here is that the risk of loss was on the seller, as the seller agreed to deliver the flanges to the buyer, and the buyer was entitled to receive them. The seller's refusal to ship replacement flanges is a breach of contract, and the buyer has the right to sue for damages. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. succeed, because the risk of loss was on the seller."
