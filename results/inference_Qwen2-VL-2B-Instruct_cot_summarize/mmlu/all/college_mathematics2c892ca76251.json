Then the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is $2^n + 1$.\nAccording to the problem, the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. So we have the equation $2^n + 1 = 2^n + 14$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $14 = 14$, which is true. So our equation is satisfied.\nNow, let's denote the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements as $2^{n+1}$.\nAccording to the problem, the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements is equal to the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements plus the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. So we have the equation $2^{n+1} = 2^n + 14$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $2^{n+1} = 2^n + 14$.\nThis equation is not satisfied for any value of $n$. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.\nThe correct answer is D."
