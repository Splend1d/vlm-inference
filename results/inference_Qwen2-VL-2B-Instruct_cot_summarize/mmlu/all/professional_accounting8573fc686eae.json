Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nNonsampling risk refers to the risk that the results of an audit sample may not be representative of the population as a whole. This risk arises because the sample is selected from the population, and the auditor cannot be certain that the sample is representative of the population as a whole."
