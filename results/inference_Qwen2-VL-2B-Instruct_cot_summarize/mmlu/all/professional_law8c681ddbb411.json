No, because payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.\nB. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\nC. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.\nD. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt.\n"

This means that the creditor could not enforce the debt due to the statute of limitations.\n\n2. **Contractual Obligation**: The debtor sold and delivered his car to the buyer under a written agreement. The buyer agreed to pay the $2,000 purchase price to the creditor \"in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor].\"\n\n3. **Contractual Obligation and Enforcement**: The buyer's promise to pay the $2,000 to the creditor is a contractual obligation. The buyer's promise to pay the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.\n\nThis option aligns with the principle that a promise to pay a debt is enforceable by the creditor, even if the original debt was barred by the statute of limitations."
