The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nA. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nB. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nC. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nD. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n"

The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Separate Consideration**: The tenant exercised the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract, which is a separate consideration for the farmer. The farmer's refusal to perform the surveying obligation was not a separate consideration for the tenant's exercise of the option.\n\n2. **Parol Evidence Rule**: The farmer's oral promise to survey the 10-acre tract was not considered in the contract. The tenant's exercise of the option was based on the tenant's belief that the farmer had the 10-acre tract surveyed, not on the farmer's oral promise.\n\n3. **Indefinite Description**: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract was not a separate consideration for the tenant's exercise of the option. The tenant's decision to exercise the option was based on the belief that the farmer had the 10-acre tract surveyed, not on the farmer's failure to survey.\n\n4. **Separate Consideration**: The tenant's exercise of the option to purchase the 10 acres was based on the tenant's belief that the farmer had the 10-acre tract surveyed, not on the farmer's refusal to perform the surveying obligation.\n\nTherefore, the tenant's exercise of the option to purchase the 10 acres was based on a separate consideration, making the farmer's refusal to perform the surveying obligation a defense to the tenant's specific performance claim."
