The binomial probability formula is given by:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 4 patients),\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, 0 patients developing side effects),\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 1 in 5 patients developing side effects),\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) successes out of \\( n \\) trials.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(X = 0) = \\binom{4}{0} (1/5)^0 (4/5)^{4-0} \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 0) = 1 \\times 1 \\times (4/5)^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 0) = 4/5^4 \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 0) = 4/625 \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 0) = 0.0064 \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 0) = 0.064 \\]\n\nSo, the probability that none of the four patients will develop side effects is 0.064, which is approximately 0.064096. The closest answer to this value is:\n\nB. 0.4096"
