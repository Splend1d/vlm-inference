Increasing federal income tax rates after World War I\n\nThe Sugar Act of 1764 was a significant measure in the American Revolutionary War, aimed at raising revenue for the British government. It was a tax on sugar, which was a major export from the colonies. The act was intended to help fund the war effort and to provide a source of revenue for the British government. The goals of the Sugar Act of 1764 are similar to those of increasing federal income tax rates after World War I, which was also a measure to raise revenue for the government."
