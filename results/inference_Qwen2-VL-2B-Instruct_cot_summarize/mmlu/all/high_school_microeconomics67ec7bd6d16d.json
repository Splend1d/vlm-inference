The MC curve represents the change in total cost with respect to the change in output, while the ATC curve represents the average cost of producing each additional unit of output. The MC curve will always be above the ATC curve, indicating that the average cost of producing each additional unit of output is higher than the marginal cost of producing that additional unit. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
