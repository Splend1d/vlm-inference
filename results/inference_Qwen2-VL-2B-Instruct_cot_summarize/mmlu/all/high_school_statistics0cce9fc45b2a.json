The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.\n\nThe correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. The slope of the regression line, on the other hand, represents the change in one variable for a one-unit change in the other variable. It is not affected by the sign of the correlation coefficient. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
