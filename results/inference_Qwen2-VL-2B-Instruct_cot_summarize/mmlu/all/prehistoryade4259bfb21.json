It is a relatively small cranium, which is consistent with the idea that anatomically modern humans were relatively small in size compared to modern humans. The cranium also shows some features that are characteristic of modern humans, such as a relatively large brain and a relatively small face. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the development of a larger brain prior to the first evidence for tool making."
