Prior to the signing of the contract, the homeowner and the painter orally agreed that their contract would be null and void unless the homeowner was able to obtain a $3,000 loan from National Bank before April 1. On March 31, the homeowner was informed by National Bank that his loan application had been rejected. The next day, the homeowner telephoned the painter and informed him that the deal was off. If the painter brings an action for breach of contract against the homeowner, would the latter's inability to secure the loan provide him with a valid defense?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner is estopped to deny the validity of the written contract.\nB. No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.\nC. Yes, because the agreement regarding the loan constituted a valid modification of the writing.\nD. Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n"

The painter promised to paint the exterior of the homeowner's house for $3,000. The homeowner agreed to pay the painter $3,000, but the agreement was contingent on the homeowner obtaining a $3,000 loan from National Bank before April 1.\n\n2. **Loan Application Rejection**: On March 31, the homeowner was informed by National Bank that his loan application had been rejected. This rejection occurred after the homeowner had signed the contract.\n\n3. **Effect of Loan Rejection**: The homeowner's inability to secure the loan from National Bank would not affect the validity of the contract. The homeowner's inability to obtain the loan was a separate event that occurred after the contract was signed.\n\n4. **Effect on the Contract**: The homeowner's inability to obtain the loan did not alter the terms of the contract. The contract remained in effect, and the homeowner was still obligated to pay the painter $3,000.\n\n5. **Effect on the Painter's Action**: The painter's action for breach of contract would not be affected by the homeowner's inability to obtain the loan. The painter's claim would still be based on the written contract, and the homeowner's inability to obtain the loan would not provide a valid defense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.**"
