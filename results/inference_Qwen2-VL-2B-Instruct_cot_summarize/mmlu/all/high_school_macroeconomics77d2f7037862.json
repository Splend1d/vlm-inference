In this case, the bank is required to reserve $250 out of the $1000 in checking deposits. This means that the bank has $750 in excess reserves. The money multiplier is the ratio of the amount of money created by the bank to the amount of money deposited. In this case, the money multiplier is 4, meaning that the bank creates $4 for every $1 deposited. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 75% $250 M = 4."
