                    "text": "The rate constant, k, is the rate at which the reaction proceeds. It is a measure of how fast the reaction is happening. In this case, the rate constant is 86 h^-1, which means that the reaction is happening at a rate of 86 times per hour.\n\nTo find out how much of the starting material will remain after 58 seconds, we need to use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount remaining} = \\text{Initial amount} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Time}}{\\text{Rate constant}} \\right) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount remaining} = 0.0500 \\, \\text{g} \\times \\left( \\frac{58 \\, \\text{s}}{86 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount remaining} = 0.0500 \\, \\text{g} \\times 0.0688111111111111 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount remaining} = 0.0344066666666667 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount remaining} = 0.034 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of the starting material that will remain after 58 seconds is 0.034 grams, which is approximately 0.034 grams. The closest answer to this is:\n\nD. 0.0625 g"
