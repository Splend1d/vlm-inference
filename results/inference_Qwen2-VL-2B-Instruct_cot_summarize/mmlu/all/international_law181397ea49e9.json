Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the ability of an individual to be subject to international law and to bring claims before international courts. While individuals can enjoy certain rights and obligations under international law, they generally do not have the same level of legal personality as States and international organisations. This is because individuals are not sovereign entities and do not have the same level of autonomy and independence as States."
