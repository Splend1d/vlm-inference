An Abelian group is a group in which the operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the group, \\(a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a\\).\n\nThe order of a group is the number of elements in the group. For an Abelian group of order 72, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. However, since 72 is not a prime number, it cannot be divided evenly by any prime number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the only possible orders for an Abelian group of order 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures of these groups:\n\n1. **Order 1**: This is the trivial group, which contains only the identity element. There is only one group of order 1, which is the group with one element.\n\n2. **Order 2**: This is a cyclic group of order 2. There are two such groups: \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) (the integers modulo 2) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\) (the integers modulo 4).\n\n3. **Order 3**: This is a cyclic group of order 3. There are two such groups: \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) (the integers modulo 3) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\) (the integers modulo 9).\n\n4. **Order 4**: This is a cyclic group of order 4. There are two such groups: \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\) (the integers modulo 4) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_8 \\) (the integers modulo 8).\n\n5. **Order 6**: This is a cyclic group of order 6. There are two such groups: \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) (the integers modulo 6) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_12 \\) (the integers modulo 12).\n\n6. **Order 12**: This is a cyclic group of order 12. There are two such groups: \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\) (the integers modulo 12) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{24} \\) (the integers modulo 24).\n\nSo, there are a total of 8 structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 8."
