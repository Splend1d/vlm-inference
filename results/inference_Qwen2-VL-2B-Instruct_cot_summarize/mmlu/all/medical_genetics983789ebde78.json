It involves the following steps:\n\n1. Denaturation: The DNA is heated to a high temperature to denature the double-stranded DNA into single-stranded DNA.\n2. Annealing: The single-stranded DNA is cooled down and then hybridized with a specific primer.\n3. Extension: A thermostable DNA polymerase is added, and the primer and DNA are extended to form a long DNA strand.\n4. Amplification: The reaction is repeated multiple times, each time with a slightly longer DNA strand, until the desired number of copies of the target DNA sequence is obtained.\n\nThis process allows for the detection and quantification of DNA sequences, which can be used in various applications such as genetic testing, forensic science, and medical research."
