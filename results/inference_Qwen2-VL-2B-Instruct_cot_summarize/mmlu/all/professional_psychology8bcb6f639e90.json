Participants dropped out of the group, reducing the size of the sample.\n\nCampbell and Stanley's research suggests that the most probable alternative hypothesis is that participants dropped out of the group, which would result in a smaller sample size and potentially biased results. This is because the sample size is a critical factor in the reliability of statistical tests, and a smaller sample size can lead to less accurate estimates of the population parameters."
