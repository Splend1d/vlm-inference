The chief investigator (who is a licensed psychologist) stresses to the student the importance of the student\u2019s data to the study, but he insists that his data be withdrawn. The investigator should:\n\nA. warn the student that withdrawal from the study will affect his course grade.\nB. remind the student that he signed an informed consent and cannot now request that his data be withdrawn.\nC. tell the student that his name will be removed from all data and include his data in the study.\nD. allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n"

The student cannot withdraw their data without the investigator's consent, as this would be a breach of the informed consent agreement. The investigator should emphasize the importance of the student's data to the study and the ethical implications of withdrawing it."
