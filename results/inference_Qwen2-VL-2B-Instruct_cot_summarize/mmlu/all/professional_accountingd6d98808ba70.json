It is the minimum amount that the company is willing to sell the stock for. In this case, the par value of the stock is $10 per share.\n\nThe fair value of the stock is the amount that the company is willing to sell the stock for. It is the amount that the company is willing to pay for each share of stock. In this case, the fair value of the stock is $100 per share.\n\nThe stock split is a way for a company to increase the number of shares outstanding without changing the total amount of stock issued. In this case, Alto Co. split its common stock 5 for 1. This means that for every share of stock issued, 5 new shares were issued. This means that the total number of shares outstanding increased from 10000 to 50000.\n\nThe par value of the stock is not affected by a stock split. Therefore, the par value of the stock remains at $10 per share.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Remained at $10."
