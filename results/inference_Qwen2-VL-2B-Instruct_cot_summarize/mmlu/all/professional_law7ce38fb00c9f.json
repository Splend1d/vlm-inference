The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that\n\nA. the defendant didn't know what was in the package.\nB. the roommate didn't tell him he was carrying illegal narcotics.\nC. the package didn't belong to him.\nD. the cocaine was illegally seized.\n"

The package didn't belong to him.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Duty of Care**: The defendant had a duty to ensure that the package was safe and secure while in his possession. If he had known that the package contained illegal narcotics, he would have taken steps to protect them, such as securing them properly or disposing of them properly.\n\n2. **Negligence**: If the defendant had been aware of the contents of the package and had not taken steps to secure it, he would be considered negligent in his handling of the package.\n\n3. **Statute of Limitations**: The defendant's possession of the package could be considered a violation of a statute that allows for the possession of illegal narcotics. If the defendant had been aware of the contents and had not taken steps to secure them, he could be charged with a violation of that statute.\n\n4. **Legal Provisions**: In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to willfully possess a controlled substance, even if the substance is not in its original container. The defendant's possession of the package could be considered a violation of this statute.\n\nTherefore, the best defense for the defendant would be to argue that he did not know what was in the package and that the roommate did not tell him about the illegal narcotics. This would likely be a strong defense against the charge of possession of illegal narcotics."
