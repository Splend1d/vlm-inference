During the operation, moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin concentration of 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200 pg/mL. Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient?\n\nA. Branch of the costocervical trunk\nB. Branch of the external carotid artery\nC.

This can be caused by damage to the parathyroid glands themselves, or by damage to the blood vessels that supply them.\n\nThe patient's serum calcium concentration is low, which is consistent with hypocalcemia. The albumin concentration is also low, which is consistent with hypoalbuminemia. The parathyroid hormone concentration is high, which is consistent with hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest that the damage to the parathyroid glands is causing a deficiency in parathyroid hormone, which is responsible for regulating calcium levels in the blood. This can lead to hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest that the damage to the parathyroid glands is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply them. This is because the blood vessels that supply the parathyroid glands are located in the neck, and the patient's symptoms suggest that the damage is occurring in the neck.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest that the damage to the parathyroid glands is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply them. This is because the blood vessels that supply the parathyroid glands are located in the neck, and the patient's symptoms suggest that the damage is occurring in the neck.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Tributary of the internal jugular vein."
