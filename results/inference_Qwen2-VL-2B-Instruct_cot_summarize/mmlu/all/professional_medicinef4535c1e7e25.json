The study enrolled 4000 subjects, aged 20 to 65 years. Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects?\n\nA. HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations\nB. The study was not blinded\nC. There was a Type II error\nD. Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure\n"

Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure\n\nThis is because the primary outcome measure of the trial was to determine the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing HIV infection, and the results showed no overall benefit. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. This suggests that the vaccine may have had a protective effect among this population, which could have influenced the overall results of the trial. Therefore, the primary outcome measure should have been the primary focus of the analysis, and the results should have been interpreted accordingly."
