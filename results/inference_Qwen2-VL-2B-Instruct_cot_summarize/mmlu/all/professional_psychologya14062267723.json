Household Responsibilities\n\nFeminist Therapy, particularly in its feminist object relations approach, addresses issues related to gender roles and expectations, including household responsibilities. It focuses on understanding the dynamics between individuals and their relationships with their environment, including their roles and expectations within those relationships.
