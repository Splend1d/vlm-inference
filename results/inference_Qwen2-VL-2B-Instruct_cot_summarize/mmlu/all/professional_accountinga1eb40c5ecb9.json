Inventory shipped on consignment to Omega Co. $360,000\n2. Inventory received on consignment from Gamma Co. $240,000\n3. Freight paid by Stone $180,000\n4. Freight paid by Gamma $100,000\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total consigned inventory:\n\nTotal consigned inventory = Inventory shipped to Omega Co. + Inventory received from Gamma Co. - Freight paid by Stone - Freight paid by Gamma\nTotal consigned inventory = $360,000 + $240,000 - $180,000 - $100,000\nTotal consigned inventory = $360,000 + $240,000 - $280,000\nTotal consigned inventory = $360,000 + $240,000 - $280,000\nTotal consigned inventory = $580,000 - $280,000\nTotal consigned inventory = $300,000\n\nNow, let's determine the amount of consigned inventory that should be included in Stone's December 31 year 1 balance sheet:\n\nConsigned inventory on December 31 = Total consigned inventory - Inventory received from Gamma Co.\nConsigned inventory on December 31 = $300,000 - $240,000\nConsigned inventory on December 31 = $60,000\n\nTherefore, the amount of consigned inventory that should be included in Stone's December 31 year 1 balance sheet is $60,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. $36,000"
