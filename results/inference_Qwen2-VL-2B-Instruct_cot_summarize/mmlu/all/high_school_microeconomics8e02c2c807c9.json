A monopoly produces more output and sells for a higher price.\n\nThis is because a monopoly has the power to set prices above the competitive level, which leads to higher profits. In contrast, a perfect competitor has no such power and therefore cannot make a profit. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nB. A monopoly produces less output and sells for a higher price.\n\nThis is incorrect because a monopoly can produce more output and sell for a higher price than a perfect competitor. The difference is that the monopoly has the power to set prices above the competitive level, while the perfect competitor cannot.\n\nC. A monopoly can make profit in the short run but not in the long run.\n\nThis is incorrect because a monopoly can make profit in the long run as well. The difference is that the profit is made in the short run, while the perfect competitor breaks even in the short run and the monopoly does not.\n\nD. A perfect competitor breaks even in the short run and the monopoly does not.\n\nThis is incorrect because a perfect competitor breaks even in the long run, not the short run.
