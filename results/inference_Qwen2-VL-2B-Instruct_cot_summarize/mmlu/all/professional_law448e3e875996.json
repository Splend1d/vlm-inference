In light of the defendant's lengthy juvenile criminal history, which included violent offenses, and the fact that armed robbery is a crime of violence, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Did the life-without-parole sentence violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment?\n\nA. No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\nB. No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\n"

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The defendant's age (14 years old).\n2. The nature of the crime (armed robbery).\n3. The defendant's criminal history (violent offenses).\n4. The nature of the sentence (life without parole).\n\nGiven that the defendant was convicted of an armed robbery, which is a crime of violence, and considering the defendant's violent criminal history, the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment is relevant. The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, including life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense."
