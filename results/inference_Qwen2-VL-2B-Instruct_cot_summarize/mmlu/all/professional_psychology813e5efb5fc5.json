The sliding fee scale is a common method of billing that allows for a fee to be adjusted based on the client's income level. By waiving the co-payment, you are essentially providing a discount to your low-income clients, which is a common practice in healthcare. However, it is important to ensure that the arrangement is transparent and fair, and that the insurance company is aware of the arrangement."
