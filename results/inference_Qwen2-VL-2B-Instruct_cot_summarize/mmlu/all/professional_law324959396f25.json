This income tax exempts taxable income earned outside of the state by photographers who live in the state. Moreover, resident-photographers of the state are not taxed on their in-state earned income. A photographer who operates a studio in the state but is a resident of another state, challenges the constitutionality of this tax. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The commerce clause.\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\n"

The commerce clause.\n\nThe commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution states that:\n\n\"The Congress shall have power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and with the Indian Tribes; and with the Indian Tribes, to ensure to them the enjoyment of certain privileges and immunities determined by law; and to make rules for the division of net, and for the equalization of the net of the different branches of the Navy.\"\n\nIn this context, the state's tax on nonresident photographers operating photographic studios in the state is a regulation of commerce with foreign nations and with the Indian Tribes. Therefore, the photographer's challenge to the constitutionality of this tax would be based on the commerce clause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The commerce clause."
