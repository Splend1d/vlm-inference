After the work was completed, the homeowner honestly believed that there were defects in the contractor's work as well as departures from the plans. In fact, the contractor had fully performed. The homeowner offered to pay the contractor $35,000 in full settlement in exchange for the contractor's promise to surrender his entire claim. The contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, and the homeowner paid the contractor $35,000. The reasonable value of the work was $35,000. Is the contractor likely to succeed in an action challenging the validity of the settlement agreement?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner honestly disputed the amount he owed the contractor.\nB. No, because the reasonable value of the work was only $35,000.\nC. Yes, because the contractor reasonably relied on the homeowner's contractual promise to pay the full $50,000, and that promise should be enforced to avoid injustice.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner's payment of $35,000 cannot furnish consideration for the contractor's relinquishment of a claim for $50,000.\n"

Yes, because the homeowner's payment of $35,000 cannot furnish consideration for the contractor's relinquishment of a claim for $50,000.\n\nThe reasoning behind this conclusion is rooted in the concept of consideration, which is the exchange of something of value between two parties. In this scenario, the homeowner's payment of $35,000 is insufficient to satisfy the contractor's claim for $50,000. The homeowner's payment is not sufficient to cover the full amount owed, and therefore, it does not provide the contractor with the necessary consideration to release their claim. This lack of consideration prevents the contractor from successfully challenging the validity of the settlement agreement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
