However, it can be used to show the truth of other matters.\n\n2. **Admissibility of Statements Against Interest**: A statement against interest is admissible if it is offered to show the truth of the matter asserted. This is typically used to show the truth of the matter asserted by the declarant.\n\nGiven the context of the case, Officer Friendly's testimony is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted by Polly. Instead, Officer Friendly's testimony is used to show the truth of the matter asserted by Polly, which is Polly's statement that she was negligent.\n\nTherefore, Officer Friendly's testimony is admissible under the hearsay rule, not the statements against interest rule.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. No, hearsay without an exception."
