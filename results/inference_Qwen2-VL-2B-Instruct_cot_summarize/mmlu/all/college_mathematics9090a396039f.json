The determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(A) = i \\cdot \\text{det}(I) - j \\cdot \\text{det}(I) \\]\n\nSince the identity matrix I is a 2 by 2 matrix with all entries equal to 1, the determinant of I is 1. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(A) = i - j \\]\n\nMatrix B is a 3 by 3 matrix with entries i + j. The determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(B) = i \\cdot \\text{det}(I) + j \\cdot \\text{det}(I) + k \\cdot \\text{det}(I) \\]\n\nAgain, since the identity matrix I is a 3 by 3 matrix with all entries equal to 1, the determinant of I is 1. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(B) = i + j + k \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the determinants of A and B:\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(A) + \\text{det}(B) = (i - j) + (i + j + k) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(A) + \\text{det}(B) = 2i + k \\]\n\nSince we don't have specific values for i, j, and k, we cannot determine the exact value of the sum. However, we can express it in terms of i and k:\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(A) + \\text{det}(B) = 2i + k \\]\n\nThis expression shows that the sum of the determinants of A and B depends on the values of i and k. Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact value of the sum. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0"
