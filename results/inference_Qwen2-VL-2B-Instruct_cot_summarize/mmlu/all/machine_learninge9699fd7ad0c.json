The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?\n\nA. 111021\nB. 110010\nC. 111110\nD. 110011\n"

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nNumber of parameters = (100 + 1) * (100 + 1) * (2 - 1)\nNumber of parameters = 101 * 101 * 1\nNumber of parameters = 10101\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 110010."
