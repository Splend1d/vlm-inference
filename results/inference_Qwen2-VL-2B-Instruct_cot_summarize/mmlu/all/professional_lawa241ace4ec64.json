Be advised that this offer will remain open until February 1. \"On January 31, the distributor sent the following fax to the manufacturer: \"Your offer is hereby accepted, but request delivery of 500 widgets in February and 500 widgets in March. \" The manufacturer received the fax the same day, but did not respond. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal effect of the distributor's January 31 fax?\n\nA. It constitutes a counteroffer, because it contains different terms from those contained in the original offer.\nB. It constitutes a rejection, because the offer implied limited acceptance to the terms contained therein.\nC. It creates an enforceable contract with delivery of 500 widgets in February and delivery of 500 widgets in March.\nD. It creates a reformation integrating the terms of both writings.\n"

It constitutes a rejection, because the offer implied limited acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The distributor's fax contains a new request for delivery of 500 widgets in February and 500 widgets in March, which is different from the original offer of 1,000 widgets at $10 each for February delivery.\n- The distributor's fax does not state that the offer is being accepted as is, nor does it state that the distributor is rejecting the original offer.\n- The distributor's fax does not state that the distributor is accepting the original offer with any modifications.\n- The distributor's fax does not state that the distributor is rejecting the original offer with any modifications.\n\nTherefore, the distributor's fax constitutes a rejection because it contains different terms from those contained in the original offer."
