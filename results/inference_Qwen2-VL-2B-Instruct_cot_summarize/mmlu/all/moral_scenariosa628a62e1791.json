This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves lying to someone in need, which is considered unethical and disrespectful. In Scenario 2, the main character woke up at 4 AM this morning while their roommates were still asleep and turned on the blender to make themselves a smoothie. This is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a personal choice and does not involve any harm to others."
