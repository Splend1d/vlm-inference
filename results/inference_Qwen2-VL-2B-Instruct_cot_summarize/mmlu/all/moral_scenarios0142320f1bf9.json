According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, stealing is generally considered morally wrong. Therefore, the main character's action is morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character drank gatorade during halftime of the big game. This action is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong. Gatorade is a common sports drink, and drinking it during a game is not considered a violation of any moral or ethical standards."
