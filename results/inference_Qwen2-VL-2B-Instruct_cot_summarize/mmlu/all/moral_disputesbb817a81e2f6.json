                    "text": "The problem presented involves understanding the reasoning behind Collins' response to an objection to care ethics. The objection is that care ethics imply that we are responsible for our attitudes, even though they seem not to be under our voluntary control. Collins responds by arguing that:\n\nB. we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly\n\nThis response suggests that while attitudes of care may not be entirely voluntary, they can still be influenced or brought about indirectly. Collins is arguing that there is a possibility for individuals to develop attitudes of care through various means, even if they are not entirely under their own control.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all.\n- This option is incorrect because Collins does not claim that caring attitudes are not moral attitudes. Instead, he argues that attitudes of care can be influenced indirectly.\n\nB. we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly\n- This option is correct and aligns with Collins' response. It captures the essence of his argument that attitudes of care can be developed indirectly.\n\nC. when we fail to have attitudes of care this means that no caring attitudes were required of us towards some person\n- This option is incorrect because Collins does not claim that failing to have attitudes of care means that no caring attitudes were required. Instead, he argues that attitudes of care can be influenced indirectly.\n\nD. Collins agrees with the objection.\n- This option is incorrect because Collins does not agree with the objection. Instead, he argues that attitudes of care can be influenced indirectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
