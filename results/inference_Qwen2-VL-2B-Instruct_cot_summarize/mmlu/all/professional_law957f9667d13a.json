Twenty days after being served, the retailer, which is incor-porated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B, filed a notice of removal in a federal district court in State B. Was the action properly removed?\n\nA. No, because the notice of removal was not timely filed.\nB. No, because the retailer is a citizen of State B.\nC. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\nD. Yes, because the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\n"

Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\n\nThe removal of a lawsuit from a state court to a federal court is governed by the Federal Question Jurisdiction Act, which requires that the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction over the case. The act states that a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over a case if the parties are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n\nIn this case, the retailer is a citizen of State B and the woman is a citizen of State A. The amount in controversy is $100,000, which exceeds the $75,000 threshold. Therefore, the action is properly removed to the federal district court in State B."
