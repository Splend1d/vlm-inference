An increase in aggregate demand (AD) shifts the AD curve to the right, which leads to higher inflation (upward pressure on the price level) and lower unemployment. Conversely, a rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve (AS curve) shifts the AS curve to the right, which leads to lower inflation (downward pressure on the price level) and higher unemployment. An increase in input costs that corresponds with an increase in unemployment shifts the AD curve to the right, which leads to higher inflation and higher unemployment. An increase in output that corresponds with a decrease in the price level shifts the AD curve to the right, which leads to lower inflation and lower unemployment."
