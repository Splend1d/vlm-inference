(i) and (iii) only.\n\nWhen the value of \\( R^2 \\) for an estimated regression model is exactly zero, it indicates that the model explains no variability in the dependent variable \\( y \\) about its mean value. This means that the model is not explaining any of the variability of \\( y \\) about its mean value. Therefore, the fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables, and the intercept coefficient estimate must be zero. However, it does not necessarily mean that all coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero, as the model may still have some explanatory power."
