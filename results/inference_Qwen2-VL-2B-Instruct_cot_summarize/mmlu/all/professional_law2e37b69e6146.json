He then pushed the woman out of the way and ran out of the subway car while carrying the purse. The man was apprehended on the subway platform while in possession of the purse. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law with respect to criminal offenses, of what crime can the man properly be convicted?\n\nA. Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.\nB. Larceny, because he made no threat to use force.\nC. Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence.\nD. Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.\n"

The man did not physically take the purse from the woman's presence; he merely grabbed it. Therefore, he did not commit larceny.\n\n2. **Robbery**: This crime involves the taking of property with the intent to deprive the owner of it. The man physically took the purse from the woman's presence, which is the key element of robbery.\n\n3. **Force**: The man used force to physically take the purse from the woman. This is a necessary element of robbery.\n\n4. **Apostrophe**: The man was apprehended on the subway platform while in possession of the purse. This indicates that he was not merely carrying the purse but was in possession of it, which is a requirement for robbery.\n\nTherefore, the man can be convicted of robbery because he used force in leaving with the purse."
