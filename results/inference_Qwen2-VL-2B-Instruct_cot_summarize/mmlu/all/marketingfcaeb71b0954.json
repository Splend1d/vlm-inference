Advertising is used to reinforce existing attitudes, not necessarily to drastically change them. This idea is based on the ATR (Attitude-Trust-Reliance) framework, which is a theory that suggests that people are more likely to adopt a new attitude or behavior if they feel that the attitude is supported by trust and reliance on the source of the information. This framework is used to explain why people are more likely to adopt new behaviors or attitudes when they feel that the source of the information is trustworthy and reliable."
