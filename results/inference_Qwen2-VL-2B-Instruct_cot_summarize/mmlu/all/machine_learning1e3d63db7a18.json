This feature has a strong effect on the model (should be retained)\n\nThe coefficient of a feature in a linear regression model indicates the strength of the relationship between that feature and the dependent variable. A relatively high negative value suggests that the feature is negatively correlated with the dependent variable, which means that as the feature increases, the dependent variable decreases. This is generally considered a positive sign and suggests that the feature should be retained in the model."
