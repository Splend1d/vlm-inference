The sentence suggests that Mexican Americans and African Americans begin engaging in sexual intercourse at different ages, and we need to determine which group starts later.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mexican Americans and whites; African Americans\n- This option suggests that Mexican Americans start engaging in sexual intercourse later than whites and African Americans. This is not necessarily true, as Mexican Americans and African Americans start engaging in sexual intercourse at different ages.\n\nB.

This is not necessarily true, as Mexican Americans and African Americans start engaging in sexual intercourse at different ages.\n\nC.
