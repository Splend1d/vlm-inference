This transfer results in an increase in venous pressure, as blood is being expelled from the heart into the veins. At the same time, the arterial pressure decreases, as blood is being pumped into the arteries. This exchange of blood between the two compartments is a crucial mechanism for maintaining blood pressure and ensuring that the heart can pump blood effectively."
