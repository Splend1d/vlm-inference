Since the database contains records of items with their selling prices, sizes, colors, and quantities, it does not provide information about the current inventory status. Therefore, this cannot be determined from the database alone.\n\nB. **Which colors are more popular among men than women**:\n   - This requires information about the color preferences of men and women. Since the database contains information about the colors of items, it does not provide information about the color preferences of individuals. Therefore, this cannot be determined from the database alone.\n\nC. **Which type of footwear is most popular among adults**:\n   - This requires information about the popularity of different types of footwear among adults. Since the database contains information about the types of footwear, sizes, selling prices, and quantities, it does not provide information about the popularity of different types of footwear among adults. Therefore, this cannot be determined from the database alone.\n\nD. **The total number of shoes sold in a particular month**:\n   - This requires information about the total number of shoes sold in a particular month. Since the database contains information about the quantities of each item, it does provide information about the total number of shoes sold in a particular month. Therefore, this can be determined from the database alone.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The total number of shoes sold in a particular month"
