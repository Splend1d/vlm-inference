Those elections saw major shifts in party alignment that would last for decades.\n\nPolitical scientists identify these elections as \"critical\" because they marked significant shifts in party alignment that had long-lasting effects on American politics. The 1932 election, for example, saw the emergence of the New Deal coalition, which included many conservative and moderate Democrats who had previously supported isolationism and the isolation of the federal government. This shift in party alignment had a profound impact on the course of American politics for decades to come. Similarly, the 1968 election saw the emergence of the civil rights movement, which led to significant changes in the political landscape and the passage of landmark civil rights legislation."
