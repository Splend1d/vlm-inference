Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration\nB. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations\nC. Ultrasonography\nD.

Ultrasonography\n\nUltrasonography is the most appropriate next step because it can help to visualize the fetus and assess the placenta, which is crucial for determining the gestational age and assessing the health of the pregnancy. Additionally, it can help to detect any abnormalities that may require further evaluation or intervention."
