No one has come close to understanding it as the development of the will to power. However, if a person even begins to regard the effects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as conditions of life and furthermore, as factors essential to the general economy of life, he will begin to get seasick. At this point, he begins to lose himself, and sail over morality. Thus, psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems. (Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil)\n\nA.

It then goes on to suggest that no one has come close to understanding psychology as the development of the will to power. The author then introduces the idea that if a person begins to consider the effects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as conditions of life and essential to the general economy of life, they will begin to lose themselves and sail over morality. This leads to the conclusion that psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. All of psychology has gotten stuck in moral prejudices and fears.\n- This option is a part of the argument but is not the final conclusion.\n\nB. No one has come close to understanding it as the development of the will to power.\n- This option is also a part of the argument but is not the final conclusion.\n\nC. If a person even begins to regard the effects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as conditions of life and furthermore, as factors essential to the general economy of life, he will begin to get seasick.\n- This option is a part of the argument but is not the final conclusion.\n\nD. Psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems.\n- This option is the final conclusion of the argument, as it directly follows from the author's argument that if a person begins to consider the effects of these conditions as essential to life, they will lose themselves and sail over morality, leading to the conclusion that psychology becomes the path to fundamental problems.\n\nTherefore, the final conclusion of the argument is:\n\nD. Psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems."
