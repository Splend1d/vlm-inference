It aimed to reduce the workload of the ECtHR by reducing the number of cases that need to be heard by a three-judge panel, and by adding a new criterion for admissibility. It also aimed to reduce the workload of the Commission of Human Rights (CHR) by abolishing the Commission's role in the admissibility process. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights."
