Commercial liberalism is the newest and most important faction of liberalism; it advocates socialist economic principles in order to address inequalities in the distribution of wealth that threaten societal and regime security.\nB. Commercial liberalism is based on the idea that free-trade directly undermines the power of the state, and argues that the market should be regulated where possible by state actors. One flaw of commercial liberalism is that it reduces cooperation and can thus increase conflict between states.\nC. Commercial liberalism is probably the oldest faction of liberalism; advocating free trade as the free movement of goods and capital, it purports that the most rapid and efficient production of wealth occurs when governments do not restrict the economic activity of private actors and the free market.\nD. Commercial liberalism advocates the restraint of private enterprise and non-governmental activity in the economic sphere, arguing that interference will hinder economic prosperity.\n"
