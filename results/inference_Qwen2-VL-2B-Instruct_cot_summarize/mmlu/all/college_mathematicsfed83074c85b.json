The volume \\(V\\) of a solid of revolution can be found by integrating the area of the cross-sections (disks or washers) along the axis of revolution.\n\nThe region is bounded by the curves \\(y = x\\) and \\(y = x^2\\) in the first quadrant. The intersection points of these curves are found by setting them equal to each other:\n\n\\[x = x^2\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[x^2 - x = 0\\]\n\n\\[x(x - 1) = 0\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions: \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\). These are the limits of integration for the volume calculation.\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) is given by the integral of the area of the cross-sections along the y-axis:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{0}^{1} (x^2 - x) \\, dy\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{0}^{1} (y^2 - y) \\, dy\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{1}\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1^3}{3} - \\frac{1^2}{2} \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid of revolution is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), which corresponds to option B."
