She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address \"to view a picture of the car,\" which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was \"used and sold as is.\" When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for\n\nA. Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.\nB. The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold \"as is.\"\nC. The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.\nD. Carol, because the \"as is\" disclosure was not totally effective.\n"

The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Carol's Position**: Carol bought a 1968 Thunderbird, which is not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. This suggests that Carol was aware of the difference in model years and the value difference, which is a significant factor in determining the value of the car.\n\n2. **Seller's Position**: The seller claimed that the car was \"used and sold as is.\" This implies that the seller did not disclose that the car was not new, which is a material fact that could affect the buyer's decision to purchase the car.\n\n3. **Negligence**: If the seller was negligent in not explicitly stating that the car was not new, it could be argued that the seller should have informed Carol about the difference in model years and value. This negligence could be a factor in determining liability.\n\n4. **Effectiveness of \"As is\" Disclosure**: The seller's claim that the car was \"used and sold as is\" does not necessarily mean that the seller was negligent. The \"as is\" disclosure could be considered effective if it was clear and honest, and if Carol had reasonable grounds to believe that the car was not new.\n\nTherefore, the likely outcome is that Carol will be held liable for not being aware of the difference in model years and value, and the seller will be held liable for not providing the necessary information about the car's condition."
