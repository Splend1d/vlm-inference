For hydrocarbons, the intermolecular forces are primarily van der Waals forces, which are strongest for non-polar molecules. As the number of carbon atoms increases, the molecules become more polar, which means they have a higher number of induced dipoles. These induced dipoles can interact with each other, leading to stronger intermolecular forces and higher melting points. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
