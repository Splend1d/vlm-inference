The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g/(kA).\n\nWhen the small block is placed on top of the original block, the force of friction between the blocks will be greater than the force of gravity on the small block. This means that the small block will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than the force of gravity on the small block. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
