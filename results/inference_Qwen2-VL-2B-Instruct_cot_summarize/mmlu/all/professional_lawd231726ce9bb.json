Fearing that the girl would beat out her daughter for the last cheerleading position, the mother decided to kill the girl. One night while the mother and her boyfriend were having dinner, the mother asked him to kill the girl. The mother handed her boyfriend a gun and gave him the home address where the girl lived. Unknown to the boyfriend, the mother gave him the wrong address. By mistake, the boyfriend went to the home of a family who lived across the street from the girl. The boyfriend rang the doorbell and a woman opened the door. The boyfriend asked the woman if her daughter was home. The woman called for her daughter to come to the front door. When she did so, the boyfriend shot and killed both the woman and her daughter. The mother should be found guilty for which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Conspiracy and voluntary manslaughter.\nB. Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.\nC. Solicitation and two counts of murder.\nD. Solicitation and attempted murder.\n"

Solicitation and two counts of murder.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Solicitation**: The mother solicited the boyfriend to kill the girl, which is a crime under most jurisdictions. The mother's solicitation is a form of incitement to commit murder.\n\n2. **Attempted Murder**: The mother gave the boyfriend the wrong address, leading him to the wrong house. This is an attempt to commit murder, as the mother's actions were intended to cause the death of the girl.\n\n3. **Murder**: The boyfriend actually killed the woman and her daughter, which is a direct result of his actions in response to the mother's solicitation.\n\nTherefore, the mother's actions constitute both solicitation and attempted murder, and the boyfriend's actions constitute murder."
