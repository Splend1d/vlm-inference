So the area of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{8^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 16\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe perimeter of the equilateral triangle is $3s = 3 \\cdot 8 = 24$.\n\nThe perimeter of the square is also 24. Since all sides of the square are equal, the length of each side is $\\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\n\nThe area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the square is $6^2 = 36$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 36, which corresponds to option C. The answer is: C."
