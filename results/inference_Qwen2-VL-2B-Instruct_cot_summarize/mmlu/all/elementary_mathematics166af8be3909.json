Both are equivalent to \\( \\frac{3}{14} \\), which is not in the same ratio to 18.\n\nB. \\( \\frac{12}{27} \\)\n- To check if this ratio is in the same ratio to 18, we can simplify it to \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\). This is in the same ratio to 18.\n\nC. \\( \\frac{60}{135} \\)\n- To check if this ratio is in the same ratio to 18, we can simplify it to \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\).
