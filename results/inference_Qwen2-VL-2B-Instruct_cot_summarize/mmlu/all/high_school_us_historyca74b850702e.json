We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nThe sentiments expressed in the speech above most directly influenced which of the following?\n\nA.

The passage of the War Powers Act of 1973\n\nThe passage of the War Powers Act of 1973 was a response to the perceived misuse of military power in Vietnam, particularly the Tet Offensive of 1968, which was a significant escalation of the war. The speech by Senator George McGovern criticized the bombing of Vietnam and advocated for a more strategic approach to the war, including a halt to bombing and a focus on ground operations. The War Powers Act of 1973 was passed to limit the president's authority to use military force without congressional approval."
