Since they are even, they can be written as $2a$ and $2b$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$. \n\nThe sum of these two numbers is $a + 2b$, and their product is $2ab$. \n\nWe are asked to find the number of different possible values for the sum of these two numbers plus their product. \n\nWe can rewrite the sum of the two numbers plus their product as $(a + 2b) + 2ab$. \n\nWe can factor out a $2$ from the expression, giving us $2(a + 2b) + 2ab$. \n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive even integers, $a + 2b$ and $2ab$ are both positive. \n\nThe expression $2(a + 2b) + 2ab$ is a sum of two positive numbers, and the sum of two positive numbers is always positive. \n\nTherefore, the number of different possible values for the sum of these two numbers plus their product is always greater than or equal to $2$. \n\nHowever, we are asked to find the number of different possible values, which is the number of distinct values that can be obtained. \n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive even integers, the possible values for $a + 2b$ and $2ab$ are limited by the fact that $a + 2b$ and $2ab$ must be less than $15$ (since $a$ and $b$ are less than $15$). \n\nThe possible values for $a + 2b$ are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100$. \n\nThe possible values for $2ab$ are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100$. \n\nThe number of different possible values for the sum of these two numbers plus their product is the number of distinct values that can be obtained from the possible values for $a + 2b$ and $2ab$. \n\nSince there are $15$ possible values for $a + 2b$ and $15$ possible values for $2ab$, the number of different possible values for the sum of these two numbers plus their product is $15 \\times 15 = 225$. \n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. \n\nLet's try a different approach. \n\nWe can rewrite the expression $(a + 2b) + 2ab$ as $2ab + 2(a + 2b)$. \n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive even integers, $a + 2b$ and $2ab$ are both positive. \n\nThe expression $2ab + 2(a + 2b)$ is a sum of two positive numbers, and the sum of two positive numbers is always positive. \n\nTherefore, the number of different possible values for the sum of these two numbers plus their product is always greater than or equal to $2$. \n\nHowever, we are asked to find the number of different possible values, which is"
