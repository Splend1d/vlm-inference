                    "text": "The court should grant the subsidiary's motion for lack of personal jurisdiction. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Domicile and Jurisdiction**: The plaintiff is domiciled in State A, and the parent corporation and subsidiary are domiciled in State B. This means that the court has jurisdiction over the parent corporation and the subsidiary, even if they are not physically present in State A.\n\n2. **Stream of Commerce**: The plaintiff alleged that the tire was manufactured in Europe and distributed in State A by the parent corporation. This indicates that the tire was part of the stream of commerce, which means it was subject to the jurisdiction of the court where it was sold or distributed.\n\n3. **Continuous, Systematic, and Substantial Contacts**: The subsidiary conducts no business in State A and has no employees or bank accounts there. However, it manufactures its tires for the European market and distributes 2% of its tires in State A through the parent corporation. This distribution is a significant part of the subsidiary's business and is conducted through the parent corporation, which is domiciled in State B.\n\n4. **General Jurisdiction**: The court has general jurisdiction over the parent corporation, which is domiciled in State B. This jurisdiction extends to the subsidiary, even if it is not physically present in State A.\n\nGiven these points, the court has jurisdiction over the subsidiary, even if it is not physically present in State A. Therefore, the court should grant the subsidiary's motion for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.**"
