A rival firm fails to match both price increases or price decreases of rivals.\n\nIn oligopoly, firms are less likely to match price increases of rivals than price decreases. This is because the cost of increasing prices is higher than the cost of decreasing prices. Therefore, firms are more likely to match price decreases than price increases."
