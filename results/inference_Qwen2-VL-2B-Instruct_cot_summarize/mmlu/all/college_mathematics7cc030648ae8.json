This is because the order of a permutation is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n\\)th power of the permutation equals the identity permutation. For a permutation of 5 objects, the identity permutation is the permutation that leaves everything unchanged, and the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n\\)th power of the identity permutation equals the identity permutation is 2. Therefore, the largest order of an element in the group of permutations of 5 objects is 12. The correct answer is C."
