This is a key characteristic of SVMs, which is a type of machine learning model used for classification tasks.\n\nStatement 2 is False, because the support vectors are not expected to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels. In general, the support vectors are chosen to maximize the margin between the decision boundary and the training data points, and this choice of support vectors is not guaranteed to remain the same across different kernels."
