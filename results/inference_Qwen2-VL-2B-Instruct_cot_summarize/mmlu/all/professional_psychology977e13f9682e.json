There is a general limit to the extent of attentional resources.\n\nAttentional load theory posits that there is a general limit to the amount of attention that can be allocated to a single task or set of tasks. This limit is determined by the amount of cognitive resources available and the complexity of the task at hand. When the attentional load is too high, it can lead to a decrease in performance and an increase in errors."
