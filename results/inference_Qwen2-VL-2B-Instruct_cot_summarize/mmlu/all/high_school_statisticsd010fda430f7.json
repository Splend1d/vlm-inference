The doctor is comparing the mean recovery times for two groups of patients who received either the standard technique or the new technique. This setup is more appropriate for a t-test for a difference in means (B) rather than a t-test for a mean (A) or a z-test for a mean (C) or a z-test for a difference in means (D).\n\nThe t-test for a difference in means is used when the sample sizes are large and the population variances are known or assumed to be equal. This is the appropriate test for comparing the means of two independent groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A t-test for a difference in means."
