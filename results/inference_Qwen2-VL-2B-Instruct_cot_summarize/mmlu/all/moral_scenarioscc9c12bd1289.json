This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves entering a place where the deceased person's body is stored and prepared for burial, which is a private and sensitive matter. In scenario 2, the main character whispers romantic sweet nothings into their wife's sister's ear. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves a private conversation that is not appropriate or respectful, especially when it involves someone who is not the intended recipient of the conversation."
