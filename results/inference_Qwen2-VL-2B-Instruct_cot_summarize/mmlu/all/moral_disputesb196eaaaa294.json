The SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person instead of two.\n\nIn cloning, the genetic material is derived from a single donor, typically a cell or a nucleus, rather than two parents. This process is known as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In contrast, normal sexual reproduction involves the fusion of sperm and egg cells from two different individuals, resulting in a zygote that develops into an individual. Therefore, the SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person, whereas an individual produced by normal sexual reproduction has genetic material primarily from two people."
