We can find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\) to find the critical points:\n\n\\[f'(x) = e^x + 1\\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n\\[e^x + 1 = 0\\]\n\n\\[e^x = -1\\]\n\nThis equation has no real solutions because the exponential function \\(e^x\\) is always positive for all real numbers \\(x\\).\n\nSince there are no critical points in the interval \\([0, 1]\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing on this interval. Therefore, the only real solution to the equation \\(e^x + x - 2 = 0\\) is the one at \\(x = 0\\), which is \\(f(0) = e^0 + 0 - 2 = -1\\).\n\nThus, the number of real solutions \\(k\\) is 1, and the number of real solutions that are not in the interval \\([0, 1]\\) \\(n\\) is 0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. k = 1 and n = 0"
