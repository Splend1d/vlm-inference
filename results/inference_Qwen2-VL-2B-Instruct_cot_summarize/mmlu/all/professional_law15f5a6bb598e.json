There were two farms situated on the property, one farm on the eastern half and one farm on the western half of the property. The farmer recorded a general warranty deed conveying the property to his son. Two years later, the son obtained a mortgage, secured by the farm property, in favor of his friend. The friend promptly recorded the mortgage. Twenty years later, the son sold the property to an investor by a general warranty deed, with the investor assuming the friend's mortgage. The following year, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to a developer, while retaining the eastern farm. There was no mention of the mortgage in the general warranty deed between the investor and developer. The developer was unable to rezone the property to build houses as he had planned, so the developer sold the western farm to a florist. The conveyance to the florist made no mention of the friend's mortgage. Three years later, the florist entered into a contract with a rancher, pursuant to which the rancher would purchase the western farm for $75,000. The closing date for the deal was set for January 15. Assuming that on January 10, the rancher conducted a title search that revealed the friend's mortgage on the property, which of the following is correct?\n\nA. The rancher would be entitled to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately.\nB. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\nC. The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\nD. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Title Theory of Mortgages**: In a title theory of mortgages, the mortgagee (the lender) has priority over the mortgagee (the borrower) in the event of a mortgage foreclosure. This means that if the mortgagee (the lender) forecloses on the property, the mortgagee (the lender) will take possession of the property before the borrower (the mortgagee) can.\n\n2. **Notice Recording Statute**: The notice recording statute is a legal requirement in some states that requires the mortgagee (the lender) to record the mortgage within a certain period after the mortgage is executed. This period is typically 30 days.\n\n3. **Sale and Partition**: When the son sold the property to the investor, the investor assumed the friend's mortgage. This means that the mortgage was transferred to the investor, and the investor became the new mortgagee.\n\n4. **Partition of Property**: The partition of the property by the investor created a joint tenancy between the investor and the borrower (the friend). This means that the borrower (the friend) retains ownership of the property, and the investor has a right to the interest of the borrower.\n\n5. **Closing Date**: The closing date for the deal was set for January 15. If the rancher conducted a title search on January 10, which is before the closing date, the rancher would not have the right to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately. The mortgage would only be encumbering the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15."
