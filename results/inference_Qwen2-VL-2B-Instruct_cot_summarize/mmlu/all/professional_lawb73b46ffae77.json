Political parties conduct primaries, and the winning candidates in each office may have their names placed on the ballot. However, nominees of political bodies or any independent candidate may only have their names placed on the ballot if they file a nominating petition signed by not less than 7% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the offices that they are seeking. The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, which is also the deadline governing party candidates in party primaries. An independent candidate, who desires to be listed on the ballot for the office of governor, challenges the constitutionality of this election law. The court will most likely declare this statute\n\nA. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech.\nB. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions.\nD. constitutional, because the election code is nonviolative of the equal protection clause.\n"

The context is the First Amendment's protection of free speech and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech.**\n   - This option suggests that the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech. However, the law does not restrict speech; it restricts the filing of petitions for political bodies and independent candidates. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **Unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.**\n   - This option suggests that the law violates the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. The law does not violate the due process clause; it merely restricts the filing of petitions for political bodies and independent candidates. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **Unconstitutional, because it violates the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions.**\n   - This option suggests that the law violates the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions. The law does not violate the voting provisions; it merely restricts the filing of petitions for political bodies and independent candidates. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. **Constitutional, because the election code is nonviolative of the equal protection clause.**\n   - This option suggests that the law is constitutional because it does not violate the equal protection clause. The law does not violate the equal protection clause; it merely restricts the filing of petitions for political bodies and independent candidates. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nThe court is most likely to declare this statute unconstitutional because it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\n**Final Answer: D. constitutional, because the election code is nonviolative of the equal protection clause.**"
