She has a preoperative written directive for no blood products through transfusion for religious reasons. Medical history is significant for hypertension and coronary artery disease. The nurse tells you the patient's blood pressure has progressively declined since the operation. Vital signs now are temperature 35.8\u00b0C (96.4\u00b0F), pulse 130/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a slightly distended abdomen with an intact incision. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Urine output has been 10 mL during the past 2 hours. Hematocrit is 30%; preoperative hematocrit was 41%. The patient has received 4 L of intravenous crystalloid in the recovery room. Reported operative blood loss was 200 mL. Drainage from the nasogastric tube is clear. Damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for these findings?\n\nA. Epigastric artery\nB. Liver\nC. Middle colic artery\nD. Spleen\n"

The patient has also received 200 mL of drainage from the nasogastric tube. These findings suggest that the patient has sustained damage to the middle colic artery, which is responsible for supplying blood to the stomach and the lower part of the small intestine. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
