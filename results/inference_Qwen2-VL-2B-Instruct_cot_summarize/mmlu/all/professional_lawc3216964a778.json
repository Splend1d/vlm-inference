The doctor examined her and determined that she was not pregnant, but decided that he would tell her she was, in order to earn his $500 fee. After receiving the $500, the doctor proceeded to have the woman admitted to a hospital by falsely informing the hospital authorities that she had a benign tumor on her uterus, which he was going to remove. He performed all the surgical procedures appropriate for an abortion under adequate hygienic conditions, but the woman began hemorrhaging and died. The doctor should be found guilty of\n\nA. murder and larceny by trick.\nB. manslaughter and false pretenses.\nC. battery and larceny by trick.\nD. murder, battery, and false pretenses.\n"
