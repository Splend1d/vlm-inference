This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?\n\nA. The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.\nB. The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.\nC. The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\nD. Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.\n"

The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: The landscaper agreed to maintain the yard for six months at $300 per month, payable at the end of the period. This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed.\n\n2. **Performance**: The landscaper performed the work for four months, which is 2/6ths of the six-month period. Therefore, the landscaper was paid for 2/6ths of the work at $300 per month.\n\n3. **Remaining Work**: The landscaper was offered another job for $500 per month, which is higher than the prevailing market rate of $300 per month. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything, indicating that the landscaper was not entitled to the full $300 per month for the remaining work.\n\n4. **Unjust Enrichment**: The landscaper was not entitled to the full $300 per month for the remaining work because the homeowner refused to pay the landscaper for the additional work. The landscaper's recovery should be based on the fair market value of the work performed, which is $300 per month for the first four months.\n\n5. **Calculating Recovery**: The landscaper was paid for 2/6ths of the work at $300 per month for four months. Therefore, the landscaper's recovery is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\frac{2}{6} \\times 4 \\times 300 = 2 \\times 4 \\times 300 = 2 \\times 1200 = 2400 \\]\n\n6. **Comparison with Unfair Market Rate**: The landscaper was offered $500 per month for the remaining work, which is higher than the prevailing market rate of $300 per month. The landscaper was not entitled to the full $300 per month for the remaining work because the homeowner refused to pay the landscaper for the additional work.\n\nTherefore, the landscaper's recovery should be based on the fair market value of the work performed, which is $300 per month for the first four months. The landscaper was not entitled to the full $300 per month for the remaining work, so the recovery should be calculated based on the fair market value of the work performed, which is $300 per month for the first four months.\n\nThus, the landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper."
