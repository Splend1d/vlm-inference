So the inequality becomes $n < n-3 < 9$.\nIf $n$ is negative, then $|n| = -n$ and $|n-3| = -(n-3) = 3-n$. So the inequality becomes $-n < 3-n < 9$.\nSimplifying the first part of the inequality gives $-n < 3$, which implies $n > -3$.\nSimplifying the second part of the inequality gives $3-n < 9$, which implies $n > -6$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we get $-6 < n < -3$.\nThe integer solutions to this inequality are $-5, -4, -3$.\nThe sum of these integers is $-5 + (-4) + (-3) = -12$.\nTherefore, the sum of all integer solutions to $|n| < |n-3| < 9$ is $-12$.\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{-12}$"
