The letter stated, \"I want to sell my antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. If you are interested please contact me.\" Three days later Bobby sent a letter to Susan stating \"I agree to pay your asking price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster.\" The next day Susan sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. If Bobby brings suit against Susan for breach of contract, the likely outcome is\n\nA. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mail box rule.\nB. For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\nC. For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\nD. For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n"

For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Timeliness of Acceptance**: Susan's letter to Bobby was sent three days after Bobby's letter accepting the price. According to the mail box rule, if a party sends an acceptance after the other party has sent an offer, the acceptance is timely. Therefore, Susan's acceptance was timely.\n\n2. **Offer and Acceptance**: Susan's letter to Bobby was an offer to sell the car for $20,000. Bobby's acceptance of the offer was timely, as it was sent within three days of Susan's offer.\n\n3. **Sale to Harriett**: The sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted the price. This is not a problem because the sale was made after the acceptance, not before.\n\n4. **Full Price**: Susan's letter to Bobby was an offer to sell the car for $20,000. Bobby's acceptance of the offer was for the full price, which was $20,000. Therefore, the sale to Harriett was for the full price, which is what Bobby agreed to pay.\n\nGiven these points, the likely outcome is that Bobby will be successful in his lawsuit, as his communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile."
