The case was tried to the court solely on documentary evidence. Immediately after the close of the evidence, the judge announced from the bench, \"Judgment shall be entered for the manufacturer,\" and judgment was so entered. The buyer has appealed the judgment.

The manufacturer was required to file proposed findings and conclusions before the trial court ruled.\nC. The trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions.\nD. The trial court erred by not providing findings and conclusions.\n"

If the trial court did not provide the parties with an opportunity to submit findings and conclusions, the judgment may be considered erroneous and warrant reversal."
