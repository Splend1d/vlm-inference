A lower standard deviation indicates that the scores are more clustered around the mean, suggesting that the scores are more homogeneous. Conversely, a higher standard deviation indicates that the scores are more spread out, suggesting that the scores are more heterogeneous.\n\nGiven the standard deviations:\n- Mr. Bee's class has a standard deviation of 11.2.\n- Mr. Em's class has a standard deviation of 5.6.\n\nSince 11.2 is greater than 5.6, Mr. Em's class has a higher standard deviation, indicating that the scores are more spread out and less homogeneous compared to Mr. Bee's class.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is:\n\nB. Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr. Bee's."
