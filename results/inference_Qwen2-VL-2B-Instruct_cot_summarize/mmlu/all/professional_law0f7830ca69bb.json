Chickenshop's reply constitutes a conditional acceptance, but not a counteroffer. This is because Chickenshop's acceptance is conditional on the terms specified by Calvin, which are the price and the delivery terms. Chickenshop's acceptance does not constitute a counteroffer because it is not an offer to sell at a different price or terms."
