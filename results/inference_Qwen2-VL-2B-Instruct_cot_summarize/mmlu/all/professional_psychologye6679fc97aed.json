The number of independent variables used in the first study was too small.\n\nWhen cross-validation of a set of predictors results in great shrinkage of an initially encouraging multiple correlation coefficients, it indicates that the model is overfitting the data. This can happen when the number of independent variables is too small, as the model is trying to fit the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns."
