This implies that the effect size is large enough to be detected at the significance level of 0.05.\n\nWhen researchers modify their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment, they are increasing the sample size. This increase in sample size is crucial because it increases the power of the test. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. A larger sample size generally leads to a higher power, making it more likely to detect a true effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase."
