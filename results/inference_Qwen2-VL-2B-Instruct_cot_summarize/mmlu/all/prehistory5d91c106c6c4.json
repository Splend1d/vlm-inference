While it is true that sled dogs were domesticated in Siberia, this information is not necessary to determine when people entered the Americas from Siberia. The Bering Strait was exposed and open for travel, the age of the earliest New World sites, and the age of eastern Siberia being inhabited are all necessary to determine when people entered the Americas from Siberia."
