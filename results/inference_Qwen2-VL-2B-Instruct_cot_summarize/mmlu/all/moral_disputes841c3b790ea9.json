The agreement of more powerful nations to require less powerful nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions for the benefit of all humanity.\n\nMutual coercion, in this context, refers to a situation where two or more parties agree to take actions that will benefit all parties involved, even if it means that one party has to take actions that are not in their own best interest. In this case, the more powerful nations agree to require the less powerful nations to curb their greenhouse gas emissions, which is beneficial for all humanity. This is an example of mutual coercion, where the actions taken by the less powerful nations are mutually agreed upon and beneficial to all parties involved."
