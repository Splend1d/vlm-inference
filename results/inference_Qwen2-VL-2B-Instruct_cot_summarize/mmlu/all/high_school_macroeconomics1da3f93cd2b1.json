GDP is calculated by adding the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy.\n\nIn this case, we have two goods: cheese and crackers. Let's calculate the GDP for each good separately and then add them together.\n\n1. **GDP for Cheese:**\n   - Cheese retails for $3 per pound.\n   - 10 pounds of cheese are produced.\n   - Value of cheese = 10 pounds * $3/pound = $30\n\n2. **GDP for Crackers:**\n   - Crackers retail for $2 per pound.\n   - 20 pounds of crackers are produced.\n   - Value of crackers = 20 pounds * $2/pound = $40\n\n3. **Total GDP:**\n   - GDP = Value of cheese + Value of crackers\n   - GDP = $30 + $40 = $70\n\nTherefore, the GDP for this economy is $70.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $70."
