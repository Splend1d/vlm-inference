The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect.

The man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\nC.

Therefore, the son will reach the age of majority at 18 years.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\nA. **The man has acquired title by adverse possession.**\n   - This option suggests that the man has acquired title by adverse possession. However, the son will inherit the tract upon his father's death, which means the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\n\nB. **The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.**\n   - This option suggests that the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18. However, the son will inherit the tract upon his father's death, so the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\n\nC. **The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.**\n   - This option suggests that the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death. However, the son will inherit the tract upon his father's death, so the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\n\nD. **The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son attains the age of 18.**\n   - This option suggests that the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son attains the age of 18. However, the son will inherit the tract upon his father's death, so the man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct description of the state of title to the tract is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son attains the age of 18.**"
