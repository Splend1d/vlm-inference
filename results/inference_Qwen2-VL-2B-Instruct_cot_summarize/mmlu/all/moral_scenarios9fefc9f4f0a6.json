The act of picking up a spider and showing it to the character is considered cruel and inhumane, as spiders are often considered to be dangerous and should not be handled or shown to people. This action violates the character's moral standards and is considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) does not do anything clearly morally wrong. Praying for rain on crops is a religious practice and is not considered morally wrong in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
