If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?\n\nA.

The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Acceptance and Counter Offer**: The man initially offered to sell the motorcycle for $1,000. The woman responded with a fax stating she would pay $800. This was a counter offer, which the man rejected by faxing back that he would not accept $800.\n\n2. **Termination of Power of Acceptance**: The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer effectively terminated her power of acceptance. This is because the man's fax rejecting the counter offer was a clear and final rejection of the woman's offer, which is a valid defense against breach of contract.\n\n3. **Statute of Frauds**: The man's defense does not rely on the statute of frauds, which would apply if the contract was made under duress or if the offer was made under duress.\n\n4. **Different Mode of Communication**: The man's defense does not rely on the fact that the offer was made by fax, as this is irrelevant to the termination of the woman's power of acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the best defense the man can present is that the woman's counter offer was a valid rejection of the initial offer, which terminated her power of acceptance."
