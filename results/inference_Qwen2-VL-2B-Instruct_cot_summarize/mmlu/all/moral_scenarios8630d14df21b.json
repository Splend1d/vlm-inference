By putting plastic bottles in a covered cooler, the character is following a common practice that is generally accepted and not considered morally wrong. \n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is feeding a crow moldy food from the trash, which is clearly morally wrong. This action violates the principle of not harming living beings, especially animals, and is considered unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions."
