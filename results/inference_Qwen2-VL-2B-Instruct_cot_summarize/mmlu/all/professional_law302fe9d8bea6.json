The city acquired a valid easement for construction of the sewer from the development company that owned the subdivision. One year later a buyer purchased a house within the subdivision. Unknown to the buyer, the sewer line ran across his property, approximately 10 feet beneath the foundation of his home. The deed that the buyer received from the grantor, the development company, made no mention of the easement. Ten years after the buyer purchased his house, a crack in the sewer line caused water to leak into the buyer's basement. The flooding resulted in extensive damage to his home. The city has abolished governmental immunity. In an appropriate action by the buyer against the city to recover damages, the plaintiff will probably\n\nA. not prevail, because the sewer line was installed before the buyer purchased the property.\nB. not prevail, because the city had acquired a valid easement for the sewer line.\nC. prevail, only if the sewer line was negligently maintained.\nD. prevail, because under the circumstances, the sewer line constituted a public nuisance.\n"

This means the city has the right to use the land for the purpose of the sewer line without the need for the development company's permission.\n\n2. **Deed**: The deed that the buyer received from the grantor, the development company, made no mention of the easement. This indicates that the buyer did not have knowledge of the easement when they purchased the property.\n\n3. **Water Leaking**: Ten years after the buyer purchased their house, a crack in the sewer line caused water to leak into the basement, resulting in extensive damage to the home. This is a breach of the easement, as the city has a duty to maintain the sewer line for the benefit of the property owners.\n\n4. **Negligence**: The city has the duty to maintain the sewer line, and if it was negligently maintained, it would constitute a public nuisance, which could be grounds for recovery by the buyer.\n\nGiven that the city had a valid easement and the buyer did not know about it when they purchased the property, the city would likely be held liable for the damages caused by the leak in the sewer line. Therefore, the buyer will probably prevail in an appropriate action against the city to recover damages."
