One afternoon, the lift suddenly broke down because of a power failure in the area. A customer was suspended in his lift chair, one-third of the way up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. The customer remained on the lift for five hours until power was restored. He was then returned uninjured to the bottom of the hill. In a suit against the ski resort, the customer is likely to have action for\n\nA. false imprisonment.\nB. negligence.\nC. assault.\nD. no cause of action.\n"

This situation can be considered a form of negligence, as the ski resort had a duty to ensure the safety of its customers and provided a service that was not functioning properly. The customer was injured as a result of the lift failure, and the ski resort is likely to be held liable for the negligence that led to the accident."
