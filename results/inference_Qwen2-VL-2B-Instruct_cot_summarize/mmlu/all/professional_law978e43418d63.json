Both requests are denied by the judge, and the defendant is found guilty. The maximum penalty for shoplifting is a $500 fine and six months in jail. The defendant is sentenced to three months in jail, which he is allowed to serve on weekends in the county detention center. The defendant claims that his constitutional rights have been violated. Is he correct?\n\nA. No, because his actual sentence was only three months.\nB. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to a jury trial.\nD. Yes, because the defendant was denied both the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial.\n"

Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Denial of Counsel**: The judge denied the defendant's request for an attorney, which is a violation of his right to counsel. This is a fundamental right under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the defendant the right to be represented by an attorney in criminal cases.\n\n2. **Denial of Jury Trial**: The judge denied the defendant's request for a jury trial, which is also a violation of his right to a jury trial. The Sixth Amendment states that the defendant has the right to a jury trial in criminal cases.\n\nGiven these violations, the defendant's claim that his constitutional rights have been violated is justified. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the defendant was denied both the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial."
