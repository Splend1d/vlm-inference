They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

This reasoning aligns with the principles of containment, which involves preventing the spread of totalitarian ideologies and maintaining a balance of power to prevent their growth.\n\nTherefore, the passage can best be seen as providing a rationale for containment.\n\nFinal answer: A. the policy of containment."
