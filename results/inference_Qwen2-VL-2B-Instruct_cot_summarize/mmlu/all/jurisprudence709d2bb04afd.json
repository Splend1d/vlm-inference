It overlooks the historical struggle of women for justice.\n\nRadical feminists argue that liberal feminism's focus on equality is mistaken because it fails to acknowledge the long history of women's struggles for justice and equality. They believe that the current state of women's rights is not a result of progress but rather a result of centuries of oppression and discrimination. They argue that the current system of gender equality is a product of historical injustices and that it is not fair or just for women to be treated equally without addressing the systemic issues that have historically prevented them from achieving true equality."
