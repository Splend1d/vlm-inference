The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.\nB. The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.\nC. The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.\nD. Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.\n"

While it is true that the Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project, it is not the only factor that contributes to the emergence of weak states. Other factors such as poverty, corruption, and political instability also play a role in the formation of weak states. Additionally, the problem of weak state insecurity has not been given a low priority on the international agenda, and solutions have been proposed and implemented. It is important to recognize that the problem of weak state insecurity is complex and requires a multi-faceted approach to address it."
