Move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy.\n\nWhen the fulcrum is moved to half its original distance from the boy, the seesaw will tilt in favor of the girl, as the girl's mass is greater than the boy's mass. This is because the force of gravity acting on the girl is greater than the force acting on the boy, and the fulcrum is moved to the side where the girl's mass is greater.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
