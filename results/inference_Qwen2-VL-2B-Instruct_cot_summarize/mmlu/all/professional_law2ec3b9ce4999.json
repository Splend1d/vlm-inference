Since they didn't have a car, the men asked the defendant to drive them to the home. The two men did not tell the defendant what they intended to do there. The defendant drove them to the house. While the defendant waited in the car, the two men entered the home by using a master key to unlock the front door. They then stole several items of expensive jewelry from the bedroom. Concealing the jewelry in their pockets, they left the house and got back into the defendant's car. Unaware of the theft, the defendant drove the two men back to their apartments. The next day, the two men pawned the jewelry for $5,000. Two weeks later, the two men gave the defendant $500 and told him for the first time about the burglary. The defendant kept the money and did not report the theft to the police. If the defendant is subsequently prosecuted, he should be found\n\nA. guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of burglary.\nB. guilty of burglary but not guilty of receiving stolen property.\nC. guilty of burglary and of receiving stolen property.\nD. not guilty of either burglary or receiving stolen property.\n"

The defendant was driving the two men to the house, which indicates active participation in the crime.\n\n2. **Receiving Stolen Property**: The defendant was aware of the theft and was present when the two men pawned the jewelry. This knowledge is a significant factor in the definition of receiving stolen property.\n\nGiven these points, the defendant is guilty of both burglary and receiving stolen property."
