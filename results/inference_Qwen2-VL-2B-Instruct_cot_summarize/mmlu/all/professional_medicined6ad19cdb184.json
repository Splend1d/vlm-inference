She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Exercise and weight reduction program\nB. Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations\nC. Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations\nD. Captopril therapy\n"

Captopril therapy\n\nGiven the patient's history of a urinary tract infection and the current blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg, it is important to consider the potential role of hypertension in her condition. Captopril is a medication that can be used to treat hypertension and is often prescribed in this scenario to manage the patient's blood pressure."
