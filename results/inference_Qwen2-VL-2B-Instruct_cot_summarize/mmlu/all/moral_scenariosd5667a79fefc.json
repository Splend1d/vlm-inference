This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves exposing oneself to others in a public setting without consent or in a manner that is considered inappropriate or offensive. \n\nIn scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) will have his baby's ears fixed. This action is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is a medical procedure that is generally considered necessary and beneficial for the baby's health. However, it is important to note that the decision to undergo such a procedure should be made with the consent of the parents or guardians involved, and it is not always a straightforward decision."
