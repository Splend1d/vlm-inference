During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\nB. admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\nC. inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Hearsay Rule**: The television correspondent's testimony is hearsay, which means it is not admissible as evidence in court. Hearsay evidence is not admissible unless it falls under one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\n2. **Recognition of Exceptions**: The exceptions to the hearsay rule include:\n   - Statements made under oath or a similar affirmative statement.\n   - Statements made during a criminal trial.\n   - Statements made during a civil trial.\n   - Statements made in the course of a legal proceeding.\n   - Statements made by a party to a lawsuit.\n\n3. **Correspondent's Testimony**: The television correspondent's testimony is not a statement made during a legal proceeding. It is a recording of a statement made by the opponent during a campaign speech. Therefore, it does not fall under any of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the testimony is not admissible under any recognized exception, the mayor's suit against the opponent is based on a hearsay statement that is inadmissible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
