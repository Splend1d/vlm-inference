According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, hiding a love note in someone else's property is generally considered morally wrong because it involves theft and is against the law. In Scenario 2, the main character gripped the woman's hand because she was falling. This action is not considered morally wrong in the same way as hiding a love note, as it is a response to a situation where the character is helping the woman who is in danger."
