So we need to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator is $1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac 1x}$. So we set this equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac 1x} = 0$\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\n$\\frac{1}{1+\\frac 1x} = -1$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $1+\\frac 1x$ gives:\n\n$1 = -1(1+\\frac 1x)$\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\n$1 = -1 - \\frac 1x$\n\nAdding 1 to both sides gives:\n\n$2 = -1 - \\frac 1x$\n\nAdding 1 to both sides gives:\n\n$3 = -\\frac 1x$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ gives:\n\n$-3 = \\frac 1x$\n\nSo the only value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero is $x = -3$.\n\nTherefore, the three real numbers that are not in the domain of $f(x)$ are $x = -3$, $x = -1$, and $x = 1$. The sum of these three numbers is $-3 + (-1) + 1 = -3$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{-3}$."
