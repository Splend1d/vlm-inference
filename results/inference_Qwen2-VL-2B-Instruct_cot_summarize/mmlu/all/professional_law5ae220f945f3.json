According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him \"wandering aimlessly\", and at times \"suspiciously\" handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man's paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts. The officers made him sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived 20 minutes later. The man later produced receipts for the items and was released. He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?\n\nA. No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.\nB. No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.\nC. Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.\nD. Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n"

False imprisonment occurs when an individual is confined in a manner that causes harm to them, and the confinement is intentional.\n\nIn this case, the man was detained by security officers who seized his bags and accused him of stealing. The officers then confined him in a hallway until the police arrived. The court must determine whether the confinement was intentional and caused harm to the man.\n\nThe court will allow the case to proceed to the jury if the officers' actions were intentional and caused harm to the man. The court will not allow the case to proceed to the jury if the officers' actions were not intentional or did not cause harm to the man.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm."
