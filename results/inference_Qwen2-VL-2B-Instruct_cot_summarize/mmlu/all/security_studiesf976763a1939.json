War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\nC.

War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.\n\nRealist perspectives emphasize the importance of power and the ability to protect oneself in the context of international relations. When a state is losing power, it becomes more vulnerable to attack and coercion, which increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behavior. This is because a state's ability to protect itself is a critical factor in its ability to maintain its power and influence in the international system."
