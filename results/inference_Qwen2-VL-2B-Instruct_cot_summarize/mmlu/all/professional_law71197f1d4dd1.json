                    "text": "A man brought a federal diversity action against his insurance company, alleging that the company had breached its duty under his insurance policy by refusing to pay for his medical expenses resulting from a mountain-biking accident. At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.\nB. No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.\nC. Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.\nD. Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 policy provision in his case-in-chief.\n"

                    "text": "The court should grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law**: This motion is made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief, not during the company's case-in-chief. The court must decide whether the evidence presented by the plaintiff is sufficient to support a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n2. **Nature of the Issue**: The issue at hand is whether the company's policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's \"unduly risky\" behavior. This is a question of law, not a question of fact.\n\n3. **Evidence and Cross-Examination**: The company presented evidence that the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's \"unduly risky\" behavior. The man did not cross-examine the witness who testified that the accident occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. This means the company's evidence was not challenged by the man, and the court should decide whether the evidence is sufficient to support the company's position.\n\n4. **Waiver of Right to Cross-Examine**: The man did not cross-examine the witness who testified that the accident occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. This means the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \"unduly risky\" policy provision in his case-in-chief.\n\nGiven these points, the court should grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law because the evidence presented by the company is sufficient to support the company's position, and the man did not challenge the company's evidence during his case-in-chief.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 policy provision in his case-in-chief."
