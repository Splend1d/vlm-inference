Inspired by a progressive revolt against the chemical company's domination of the state government, the corporate official's opponent, won by an extremely close margin. After the new governor took office, he vowed to get back at the company that owned the local newspaper for its newspaper's endorsement of the corporate official. Using his influence, the new governor was instrumental in getting the state legislature to pass a bill that imposed a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals of general circulation. The tax bill was signed into law by the governor. The strongest constitutional basis upon which to challenge the validity of the tax would be the\n\nA. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. bill of attainder provision under Article I, Section 10.\nC. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

This clause is particularly relevant in cases where a state law is applied to a group of people in a discriminatory manner. In this scenario, the new governor's action of imposing a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals of general circulation would be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause, as it would be considered a discriminatory measure that violates the equal protection rights of the people who own the local newspaper."
