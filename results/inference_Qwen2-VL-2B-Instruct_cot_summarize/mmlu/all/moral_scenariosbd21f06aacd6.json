According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, laughing at someone who makes a joke is generally considered morally wrong because it is considered disrespectful and insensitive. In Scenario 2, the main character is watching small squirrels from a distance and throwing them nuts. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is considered a harmless and non-intrusive activity, and it does not cause any harm to the squirrels or the environment."
