The brothers took the wife hostage, pointed a gun at her head, and demanded that she drive them in her car to their hideout. As the wife was driving down the street, a woman pushing her baby in a stroller suddenly stopped in the middle of the intersection. In order to avoid hitting the woman and her child, the wife veered the car to the left, and intentionally struck a bystander, instantly killing him. If the wife is subsequently prosecuted for the murder of the bystander, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because she intentionally veered the car, striking the bystander.\nB. not guilty, by reason of necessity.\nC. not guilty, by reason of duress.\nD. not guilty, by reason of self-defense.\n"

The bystander was in danger, and the wife's actions were necessary to prevent a collision that could have resulted in a fatal outcome. This is a common defense in cases of self-defense, where the defendant's actions were justified by the immediate threat to their own safety.\n\n2. **Self-Defense (Justification):** The wife's actions were also justified under the principle of self-defense. She was in a situation where her life was in immediate danger, and her actions were necessary to prevent a fatal outcome. This is a valid defense in cases where the defendant's actions were taken in response to a direct threat to their own life.\n\nGiven these points, the wife's actions can be considered as justified under both the principle of necessity and self-defense. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. not guilty, by reason of self-defense.**"
