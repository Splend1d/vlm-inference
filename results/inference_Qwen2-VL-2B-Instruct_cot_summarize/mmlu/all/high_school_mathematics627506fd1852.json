When multiplying two matrices, the number of rows in the first matrix must equal the number of columns in the second matrix. \n\nGiven:\n- Matrix A has dimensions 2 \u00d7 7\n- Matrix B has dimensions 7 \u00d7 5\n\nTo find the dimensions of the product matrix AB, we compare the number of rows in A with the number of columns in B. \n\n- The number of rows in A is 2\n- The number of columns in B is 5\n\nSince 2 (rows in A) does not equal 5 (columns in B), the product matrix AB cannot have dimensions 2 \u00d7 5.
