After an unanticipated zoning change increased the land's fair market value to $150,000 during the executory period, the owner refused to close. Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate. The investor paid the buyer $25,000. The investor knew of the owner's refusal to close, and the owner continued to refuse to close despite the investor's demands that he do so. The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD. The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n"

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Assignment of the Contract**: The investor assigned the contract to the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate. This assignment is a valid and enforceable contract, and the investor is entitled to the benefits of the contract, including the right to specific performance.\n\n2. **Lack of Marketable Title**: The zoning change increased the fair market value of the land, which is a valid reason for the owner to refuse to close. However, the investor is not bound by the zoning change, and the zoning change does not affect the contract's enforceability.\n\n3. **Clean Hands**: The investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands. The zoning change did not affect the contract, and the investor is not entitled to specific performance based on the zoning change.\n\n4. **Specific Performance**: Specific performance is not an available remedy for the investor. The investor is entitled to money damages, but not to specific performance.\n\nTherefore, the investor will likely prevail because the assignment of the contract to an experienced buyer is valid and the zoning change does not affect the enforceability of the contract."
