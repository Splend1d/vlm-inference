                    "text": "The question at hand involves the admissibility of extrinsic evidence, specifically a videotape from a pot party that Jones left just before his arrest. The key point here is whether the prosecutor's question about Jones' statement during the pot party is admissible.\n\nThe relevant legal principle here is that the admissibility of extrinsic evidence depends on whether it is relevant to the issue at hand. Specifically, the question about Jones' statement during the pot party is relevant because it is a critical piece of evidence that could be used to impeach Jones' credibility as a witness.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness.\n- This option is correct. The question about Jones' statement during the pot party is relevant to the issue of Jones' credibility as a witness, which is a critical factor in determining the admissibility of the videotape.\n\nB. Admissible, so long as the prosecutor produces a certified copy of the conviction.\n- This option is incorrect. The videotape is not a certified copy of a conviction, so it cannot be used as extrinsic evidence.\n\nC. Not admissible, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence.\n- This option is incorrect. The videotape shows Jones' actions, which can be used to impeach his credibility as a witness.\n\nD. Not admissible because it is irrelevant.\n- This option is incorrect. The videotape shows Jones' actions, which can be used to impeach his credibility as a witness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness."
