Both children are equally likely to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\nThe meta-analysis of research on the relationship between marital discord and child behavior problems suggests that there is no significant difference in the likelihood of children of divorced or separated parents exhibiting immediate behavior problems compared to children of stable marriages. This means that both children are equally likely to experience immediate behavior problems regardless of their parents' marital status."
