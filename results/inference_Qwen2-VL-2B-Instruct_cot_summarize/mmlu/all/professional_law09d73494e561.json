At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?\n\nA. No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.\nB. No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.\nC. Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand involves the admissibility of evidence during a criminal trial. The key here is to determine whether the prosecutor's offer of the medical treatise excerpts is admissible under the circumstances.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The prosecutor is offering the medical treatise excerpts to establish the substance the defendant added to the resident's food is lethal. This is a type of expert testimony, which is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.\n\n2. **Hearsay Rule**: The hearsay rule generally prohibits the admission of statements made out of court, unless they are admitted by a party in interest. However, in this case, the prosecutor is not in court to present the evidence; rather, they are offering it to the jury.\n\n3. **Learned Treatise Exception**: The learned treatise exception allows the admission of expert testimony that is based on the content of a learned treatise. This exception is relevant here because the prosecutor is relying on the content of a learned treatise to support the prosecution's claim.\n\n4. **Admissibility of Excerpts**: The prosecutor is not offering the entire treatise but rather excerpts that are relevant to the prosecution's case. These excerpts are not hearsay because they are not made out of court and are not offered by a party in interest.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The prosecutor's offer of the medical treatise excerpts is admissible under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.**"
