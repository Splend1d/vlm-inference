It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\n\nThe margin of error in a poll is a measure of the uncertainty or variability in the results. It is calculated by adding and subtracting a certain percentage of the sample size from the sample proportion. In this case, the margin of error is 5%, which means that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school could be anywhere between 38% and 48% (inclusive) of the sample size. This is because the margin of error is a measure of the precision of the poll, not the actual proportion of the population."
