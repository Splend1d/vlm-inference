This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves exploiting a vulnerable group of individuals (college students) for financial gain. In Scenario 2, the main character went to the sea to go fishing for salmon. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves taking someone else's property (the sea) without permission and engaging in a form of theft."
