This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves stealing from a person's property without their consent. In Scenario 2, the main character wiped the soap out of the tub because their grandma could slip when she steps into it. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a practical and necessary action to ensure safety for the elderly person."
