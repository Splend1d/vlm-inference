This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves a disregard for the safety of others and a lack of consideration for the pedestrian's well-being. In scenario 2, the main character took his wallet after getting a ride home from the bar. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a common practice in many cultures and is often considered a part of social norms and expectations."
