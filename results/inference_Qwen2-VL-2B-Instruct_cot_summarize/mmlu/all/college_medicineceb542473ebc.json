                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum. The momentum of the water exiting the nozzle is conserved, and the initial momentum of the water entering the nozzle is equal to the final momentum of the water exiting the nozzle.\n\nLet's denote the initial velocity of the water as \\( v_0 \\) and the final velocity as \\( v_f \\). The initial momentum of the water entering the nozzle is \\( m \\cdot v_0 \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the water. The final momentum of the water exiting the nozzle is \\( m \\cdot v_f \\).\n\nThe area of the nozzle is \\( A \\), and the area of the hose is \\( A_{\\text{hose}} \\). The nozzle is 1/3 the area of the hose, so \\( A_{\\text{nozzle}} = \\frac{1}{3} A_{\\text{hose}} \\).\n\nThe pressure \\( P \\) is constant, and the nozzle is in a vacuum, so the only force acting on the water is the force of gravity. The force of gravity is \\( mg \\), where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\( 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)).\n\nThe initial velocity of the water is \\( v_0 = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), and the final velocity of the water is \\( v_f \\). The mass of the water is \\( m = \\frac{v_0}{g} = \\frac{2}{9.8} \\approx 0.204 \\, \\text{kg} \\).\n\nThe final momentum of the water exiting the nozzle is \\( m \\cdot v_f \\), and the initial momentum of the water entering the nozzle is \\( m \\cdot v_0 \\). Since the initial and final velocities are equal, we have:\n\n\\[ m \\cdot v_0 = m \\cdot v_f \\]\n\n\\[ v_0 = v_f \\]\n\n\\[ v_f = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the final velocity of the water as it exits the nozzle is \\( 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), which corresponds to option A."
