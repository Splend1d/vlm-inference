AP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below it.\n\nThe average product (AP) of labor is the total output produced by an additional unit of labor, while the marginal product (MP) is the additional output produced by an additional unit of labor. When MP is above AP, it means that the marginal benefit of additional labor is greater than the marginal cost of additional labor, so the total output increases. Conversely, when MP is below AP, it means that the marginal benefit of additional labor is less than the marginal cost of additional labor, so the total output decreases."
