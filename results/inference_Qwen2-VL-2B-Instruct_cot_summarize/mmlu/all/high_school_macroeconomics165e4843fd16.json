The imports are $3 million.\n\nSo, the total spending is:\n\\[10 \\text{ million} = 6 \\text{ million} + 2 \\text{ million} + 3 \\text{ million} + \\text{ investments}\\]\n\n\\[10 \\text{ million} = 11 \\text{ million} + \\text{ investments}\\]\n\nTherefore, the investments are:\n\\[11 \\text{ million} - 10 \\text{ million} = 1 \\text{ million}\\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\nB. $1 million"
