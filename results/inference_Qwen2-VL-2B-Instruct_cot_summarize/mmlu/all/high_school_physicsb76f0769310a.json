If the original velocity is doubled, the new velocity is \\( 2V \\).\n\nThe new equation becomes:\n\n\\[ d' = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times \\frac{m}{2} \\times E}{q}} \\]\n\n\\[ d' = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{mE}{q}} \\]\n\nThis is the same as the original equation, indicating that the distance traveled by the particle is independent of the mass and velocity.
