Asexual reproduction\n\nAsexual reproduction does not promote linkage disequilibrium because it does not involve genetic recombination or crossing over, which are necessary for the formation of recombinant DNA segments. Instead, asexual reproduction results in the production of genetically identical offspring, which means that the genetic material is not subject to the same genetic recombination processes that can lead to linkage disequilibrium."
