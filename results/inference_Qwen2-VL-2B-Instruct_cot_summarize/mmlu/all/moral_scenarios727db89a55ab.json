In scenario 2, the main character is playing the drums loudly in a nursery, which is generally considered acceptable and does not cause any harm to the children or the nursery environment. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the main character's actions in scenario 1 are clearly morally wrong, while the actions in scenario 2 are not."
