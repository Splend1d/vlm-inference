Piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction\n\nPiracy under international law is generally subject to universal jurisdiction, which means that any state can bring a case against a person accused of piracy anywhere in the world, regardless of the person's nationality or the country where the crime was committed. This is because piracy is considered a crime against humanity, and the international community has agreed to take action against individuals who commit such crimes."
