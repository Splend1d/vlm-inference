The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage.

                    "text": "To determine how the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 contradicted Frederick Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above, we need to analyze the context and the core of Douglass's argument.\n\nFrederick Douglass's argument is that the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition due to their complete organization. He argues that the State governments, church organizations, and the Federal Government are all aligned with slavery, and that the pen, purse, and sword are united against the simple truth preached by humble men in obscure places.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\n   - This option suggests that Lincoln was promoting the idea of freedom for settlers, which directly contradicts Douglass's argument that the slaveholders have a decided advantage due to their complete organization. Lincoln's actions were aimed at promoting freedom for settlers, not to undermine the slaveholders' organization.\n\nB. Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\n   - This option suggests that Lincoln was promoting land ownership for settlers, which aligns with Douglass's argument that the slaveholders have a decided advantage due to their complete organization. Lincoln's actions were aimed at promoting land ownership for settlers, not to undermine the slaveholders' organization.\n\nC. Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.\n   - This option suggests that Lincoln was favoring the exclusion of slavery from new territories, which aligns with Douglass's argument that the slaveholders have a decided advantage due to their complete organization. Lincoln's actions were aimed at excluding slavery from new territories, not to undermine the slaveholders' organization.\n\nD. Lincoln enacted the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule.\"\n   - This option suggests that Lincoln was giving land to newly freed slaves, which aligns with Douglass's argument that the slaveholders have a decided advantage due to their complete organization. Lincoln's actions were aimed at giving land to newly freed slaves, not to undermine the slaveholders' organization.\n\nConsidering the context and the core of Douglass's argument, the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 that contradict Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above are:\n\nC. Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.\n\nFinal answer: C. Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories."
