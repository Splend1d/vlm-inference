However, the argument focuses on the deterrent effect rather than the effectiveness of the death penalty in preventing murder.\n\n2. **Option B: Criminal law is supposed to protect the innocent over murderers.**\n   - This option aligns with the argument that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder because it is seen as a way to protect innocent people from the risk of being killed by a murderer.\n\n3. **Option C: The severity and finality of the death penalty is appropriate to the seriousness and finality of murder.**\n   - This option supports the argument that the death penalty is appropriate because it is seen as a severe and final punishment for murder, which aligns with the argument that it is not a deterrent.\n\n4. **Option D: All of the above.**\n   - This option encompasses all the points made in the argument, which are that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder, it is seen as a way to protect innocent people, and it is appropriate because it is severe and final.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. All of the above.**"
