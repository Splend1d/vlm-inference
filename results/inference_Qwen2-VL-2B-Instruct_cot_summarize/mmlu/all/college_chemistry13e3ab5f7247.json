Paramagnetism is a property of materials that exhibit a magnetic moment in the absence of an external magnetic field, while ferromagnetism is a property of materials that exhibit a strong magnetic moment in the presence of an external magnetic field. Both paramagnetism and ferromagnetism are caused by the presence of unpaired electrons in the material. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
