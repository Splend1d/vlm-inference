Calculate Aston's ordinary income:\n   - Aston's basis in the partnership is $40000.\n   - Aston received distributions of $5000 during the year.\n   - Aston's ordinary income = Basis in partnership * Distributions received\n   - Aston's ordinary income = $40000 * $5000 = $2,000,000\n\n2. Calculate Aston's share of the partnership's ordinary income:\n   - Aston's share = Aston's ordinary income / Total ordinary income\n   - Aston's share = $2,000,000 / $2000000\n   - Aston's share = $10,000\n\nTherefore, Aston's share of AB's ordinary income is $10,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $10,000"
