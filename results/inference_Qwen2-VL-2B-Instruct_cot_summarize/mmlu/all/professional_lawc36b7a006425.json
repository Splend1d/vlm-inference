On the sidewalk, he was confronted and threatened by a stranger - a large bald man covered with tattoos \u0080\u0094 who was holding a serrated butter knife. The man came close to the boy's face and in an angry voice said \"I am going to fillet you like a fish with this butter knife,\" and gestured in a menacing fashion. The boy took his army knife out, stabbed the man in the leg, and ran. The police officer who reviewed the matter decided that the man's threat was not objectively credible and that the boy had no authority to react. She arrested the boy for assault with a deadly weapon. The trial judge instructed the jury that the knife was a simple household utensil and not a deadly weapon. The boy was convicted at trial. Will the appellate court likely uphold the conviction?\n\nA. No, because a butter knife can be as deadly as any other knife for the purpose of inflicting bodily harm, and the boy was conservative in his response to the situation.\nB. No, because a person of that age in that factual situation could have reasonably been placed in fear of immediate bodily harm, and thus be entitled to act in his own defense.\nC. Yes, because the boy had no right to react when he knew or should have known that someone could not be filleted with a butter knife.\nD. Yes, because the response was disproportionate to the threat.\n"

The key factors to consider are the nature of the threat, the boy's age, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.\n\n1. **Nature of the Threat**: The boy was confronted by a large, bald man who was holding a serrated butter knife. The man threatened to \"fillet\" the boy with the knife, which is a serious and potentially lethal threat. The boy's response was to use his own knife to defend himself, which is a reasonable and appropriate action in such a situation.\n\n2. **Age of the Child**: The boy was 13 years old, which is a significant age for a child to be able to react appropriately to a threat. The boy's response was conservative, which suggests that he was aware of the potential danger and chose to use a non-lethal weapon to protect himself.\n\n3. **Circumstances of the Incident**: The boy's response was not disproportionate to the threat. The boy used a butter knife, which is a common household utensil, to defend himself against a larger, aggressive individual. This is not an extreme or disproportionate response.\n\nGiven these factors, the boy's actions were reasonable and appropriate in the context of the situation. The trial judge's decision to arrest the boy for assault with a deadly weapon was based on the belief that the threat was not objectively credible and that the boy had no authority to react. The appellate court is likely to uphold the conviction because the boy's actions were reasonable and appropriate in the context of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because a person of that age in that factual situation could have reasonably been placed in fear of immediate bodily harm, and thus be entitled to act in his own defense.**"
