                    "text": "Statement 1: For every positive integer \\( n \\), there is a cyclic group of order \\( n \\).\n\nThis statement is true. A cyclic group of order \\( n \\) is generated by a single element, and every element in the group can be expressed as a power of that generator. For example, if \\( n = 3 \\), the cyclic group of order 3 is generated by the element \\( a \\) such that \\( a^3 = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element. Thus, every positive integer \\( n \\) can be the order of a cyclic group.\n\nStatement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nThis statement is false. A finite cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. The order of a group is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( a^n = e \\), where \\( a \\) is the generator of the group and \\( e \\) is the identity element. The order of a group can be any positive integer, but it cannot be a divisor of the order of the group. For example, the group of integers modulo \\( n \\) has order \\( n \\), but it cannot contain an element of order \\( d \\) where \\( d \\) divides \\( n \\) but is not equal to \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
