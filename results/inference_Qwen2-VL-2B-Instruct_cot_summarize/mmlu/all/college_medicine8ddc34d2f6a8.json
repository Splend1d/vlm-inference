The number of mice pressing the lever at each power level can be used to estimate the threshold power level.\n\nThe threshold power level is the power level at which the number of mice pressing the lever is at its minimum. This is because at this power level, the mice are just able to hear the bell, and they do not press the lever due to the noise.\n\nLet's calculate the threshold power level for each power level:\n\n1. At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever.\n2. At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever.\n3. At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever.\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the number of mice pressing the lever decreases as the power level decreases. This indicates that the threshold power level is at the lowest power level where the number of mice pressing the lever is at its minimum.\n\nTherefore, the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell corresponds to the power level of 60%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 60%"
