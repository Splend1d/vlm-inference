                    "text": "Given that A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability of their union P(A \u222a B) is 0. This is because the union of two mutually exclusive events cannot occur simultaneously, so their probability is 0.\n\nFor independent events, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities. This is because the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. Therefore, P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.\n\nFor a subset of A, the probability of the union is the probability of the subset plus the probability of the union of the subset and the rest of A. This is because the subset is a subset of A, so its probability is 0.3. The probability of the union of the subset and the rest of A is the probability of the subset plus the probability of the union of the subset and the rest of A, which is 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
