The pedestrian was seriously injured in the accident and sued the motorist to recover damages for personal injuries. There were no witnesses to the accident. The motorist claims that the traffic light was green at the time she entered the intersection. The pedestrian now has amnesia and cannot remember how the accident occurred. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that she was in the emergency room at the hospital when the pedestrian was brought in following the accident. The witness further testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated for his injuries, the nurse asked him, \"How did you get hurt?\" The pedestrian replied, \"The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection. \"Upon objection, this evidence is\n\nA. admissible as a statement made for purposes of medical treatment and diagnosis.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because the witness was eavesdropping on a confidential communication between the pedestrian and a hospital representative.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

In this case, the exception that would allow the witness's testimony is the \"necessity for the truth\" exception, which allows hearsay evidence if it is necessary to establish the truth of a material fact in issue. However, the witness's testimony is not necessary to establish the truth of the material fact in issue (the accident's cause), so it is not admissible under this exception."
