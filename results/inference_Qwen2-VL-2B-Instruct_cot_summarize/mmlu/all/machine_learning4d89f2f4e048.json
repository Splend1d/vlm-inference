The back-propagation algorithm is used to train neural networks, but it does not guarantee that the resulting network is globally optimal. It can converge to a local minimum, which means that the network may not be the best possible solution.\n\nStatement 2: The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line.\n- This statement is false. The VC dimension of a line is actually at most 1. This is because a line can intersect at most two points, and it cannot intersect at three points simultaneously. Therefore, it cannot shatter any set of three points.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
