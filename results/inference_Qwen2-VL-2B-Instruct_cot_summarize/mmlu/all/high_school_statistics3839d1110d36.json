The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.\n\nA discrete probability distribution of a random variable X is a set of probabilities associated with each possible value of X. The expected value of X, denoted as E(X), is calculated as the sum of each possible value of X multiplied by its probability. Therefore, the expected value of X is np, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success in each trial.\n\nThe sum of all possible values of X is equal to the total number of trials, which is n. This is because each possible value of X is counted exactly once in the set of all possible values of X.\n\nThe probability distribution is not necessarily bell-shaped and symmetric. The shape and symmetry of a probability distribution depend on the specific distribution and the values of the random variable X."
