In this case, the deed conveyed a tract of land to the woman for a consideration of one dollar, with the understanding that if liquor is ever sold on the tract of land, then the tract of land would revert to the woman's cousin and his heirs. The deed also states that if the interest conveyed to the woman's cousin is not valid, then the woman has the right to re-enter the tract of land and take back her property.\n\nIn 2004, the friend died intestate before the wheat he had planted could be harvested. This means that the friend's estate would be divided among the woman and the woman's heirs. Therefore, the woman is entitled to the proceeds of the crop.\n\nThe correct answer is C. The woman."
