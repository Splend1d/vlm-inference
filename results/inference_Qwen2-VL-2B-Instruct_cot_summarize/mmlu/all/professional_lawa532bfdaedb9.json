One year later, the employer had the employee sign a covenant not to compete for a two-year period after termination. Two years later, the employee quit and went to work for a competitor company. The prior employer sued, asking for a preliminary injunction to enforce the covenant. The employee argued that the covenant was invalid because no consideration passed to her \u0080\u0093 she could be fired at any time and did not receive anything for signing. The employer argued that it provided her with continued employment when it did not have to do so. Does the employer have a legal right to enforce the covenant?\n\nA. Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration.\nB. Yes, because modification of an existing contract does not require consideration.\nC. Yes, because the courts never question the adequacy of consideration in an agreement.\nD. No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.\n"

The employer's right to enforce the covenant is based on the principle of consideration, which is the exchange of something of value between the parties to the contract. In this case, the employer provided the employee with continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant, which is sufficient consideration for the covenant to be enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration."
