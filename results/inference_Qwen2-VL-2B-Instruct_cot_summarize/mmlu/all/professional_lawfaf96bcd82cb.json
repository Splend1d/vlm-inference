He was permitted to borrow law books and legal treatises to take home for his own personal use. One afternoon, the law student was preparing a brief in the firm's law library when he noticed a book lying on the conference table. Making sure no one was watching him, he took the book and placed it in his briefcase. He planned to take the book home that night with the intention of not returning it. If the law student is subsequently charged with larceny of the book, which of the following claims, if true, would LEAST aid him in his defense?\n\nA. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\nB. He intended to return the book after reading it.\nC. The law firm had given him possession of the book.\nD. The law firm had given him custody of the book.\n"

The law student is charged with larceny of the book, which means he took the book without permission and intended to keep it for personal use.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.**\n   - This claim suggests that the law firm was not providing the student with the salary he was entitled to, which could be seen as a form of theft. However, it does not directly address the intent to keep the book for personal use.\n\nB. **He intended to return the book after reading it.**\n   - This claim suggests that the student intended to return the book after reading it. This could be a defense if the student intended to return the book to the law firm after reading it, but it does not directly address the intent to keep the book for personal use.\n\nC. **The law firm had given him possession of the book.**\n   - This claim suggests that the law firm had already given the student possession of the book, which would not be a defense in this scenario since the student took the book without permission.\n\nD. **The law firm had given him custody of the book.**\n   - This claim suggests that the law firm had given the student custody of the book, which would be a defense if the student intended to keep the book for personal use. However, it does not directly address the intent to keep the book for personal use.\n\nGiven the context and the intent of the law student, the claim that would LEAST aid him in his defense is:\n\n**C. The law firm had given him possession of the book.**\n\nThis claim does not directly address the intent to keep the book for personal use, which is the core issue in larceny."
