Examples of public goods include roads, parks, public libraries, and public transportation systems. Private violin lessons and a $1 ticket for admission to a museum are private goods, as they are provided by private entities and are not available to everyone. A bag of potato chips is a private good as well, as it is not available to everyone and is typically consumed by individuals."
