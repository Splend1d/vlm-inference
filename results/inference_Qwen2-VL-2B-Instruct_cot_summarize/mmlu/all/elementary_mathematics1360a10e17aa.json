We can do this by dividing the total number of pages he read by the total number of hours it took him to read the book.\n\nJerry read a 200-page book in 10 hours, so his reading rate is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Reading Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Pages}}{\\text{Number of Hours}} = \\frac{200}{10} = 20 \\text{ pages per hour} \\]\n\nNow, we want to find out how long it will take him to read a 320-page book at the same rate. We can use the same formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Pages}}{\\text{Reading Rate}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{320}{20} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jerry 16 hours to read a 320-page book at the same rate he did for the 200-page book. The correct answer is:\n\nA. 16 hours"
