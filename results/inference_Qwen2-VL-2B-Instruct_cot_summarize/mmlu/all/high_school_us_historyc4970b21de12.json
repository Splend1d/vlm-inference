He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of these statements best describes the Emancipation Proclamation?\n\nA. It guaranteed the freedom of all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.\nB. It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.\nC. It declared that the freedom of the slaves was conditional upon the agreement of individual southern states to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government.\nD. It prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement best describes the Emancipation Proclamation, let's analyze the context and core of the question:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 to declare the immediate freedom of all slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action was a significant step in the Civil War and was intended to end slavery in the Southern states.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"It guaranteed the freedom of all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.\"\n     - This option is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation did not guarantee the freedom of all slaves; it only declared the immediate freedom of slaves in the Confederate States.\n   - **Option B**: \"It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.\"\n     - This option is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in all states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States, not just those in rebellion.\n   - **Option C**: \"It declared that the freedom of the slaves was conditional upon the agreement of individual southern states to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government.\"\n     - This option is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation did not require the signing of a peace treaty; it declared immediate freedom of slaves in rebellion states.\n   - **Option D**: \"It prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies.\"\n     - This option is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation did not prohibit the use of slaves in combat; it only declared immediate freedom of slaves in rebellion states.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that best describes the Emancipation Proclamation is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.**"
