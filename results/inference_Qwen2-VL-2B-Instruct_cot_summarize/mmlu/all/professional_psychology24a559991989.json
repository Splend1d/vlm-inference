Let's analyze each option to determine which one accurately describes \"adverse impact\":\n\nA. \"a group covered by law is hired at a rate less than 80% of that of the group with the best selection\" - This option describes a situation where the selection rate is lower for a group covered by law compared to the best selection rate, but it does not necessarily indicate that the selection process has an adverse impact on the group.\n\nB. \"selection interviews are 'adverse' for groups covered by law and result in differential selection rates\" - This option directly addresses the concept of \"adverse impact\" by stating that the selection process itself is adverse for groups covered by law, leading to differential selection rates.\n\nC. \"adverse conditions exist for selection of groups covered by law\" - This option suggests that there are adverse conditions in the selection process, but it does not specifically mention that the selection process itself is adverse.\n\nD. \"the total selection process results in unequal results for one or more groups covered by law\" - This option describes the overall outcome of the selection process, which is not necessarily linked to the adverse impact of the selection process itself.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate description of \"adverse impact\" is:\n\nB. selection interviews are \"adverse\" for groups covered by law and result in differential selection rates\n\nThis option directly addresses the concept of adverse impact by indicating that the selection process itself is adverse for groups covered by law, leading to differential selection rates."
