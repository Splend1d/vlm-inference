The contract provided that the construction company would be paid upon completion of the warehouse. The contractor finished the warehouse but it had some minor deviations from the plans due to substitution for certain building materials that were not available in the market. The construction company finished working and demanded payment. The paper company refused to pay based on deviations from the specifications. Will the construction company likely prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company?\n\nA. Yes, a company that performs construction work can always collect for what it has done on a job.\nB. No, the construction company cannot change the specifications and hope to get paid.\nC. No, the construction company is guilty of fraud and misrepresentation.\nD. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n"

                    "text": "The construction company is likely to prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Completion of the Warehouse**: The construction company finished the warehouse according to the contract terms. This is a fundamental aspect of the contract, and the paper company cannot claim that the work was not completed.\n\n2. **Substitution of Building Materials**: The paper company refused to pay based on the deviations from the specifications due to the substitution of building materials. This is a breach of the contract because the paper company was not required to pay for the materials that were not available in the market.\n\n3. **Substantial Performance**: The paper company's refusal to pay is based on the fact that the construction company did not perform the work as per the contract. The paper company has not paid for the work that was done, and the construction company has not paid for the work that was not done.\n\nGiven these points, the construction company has substantially performed the contract, and the paper company has not performed the contract as per the terms. Therefore, the construction company is likely to prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.**"
