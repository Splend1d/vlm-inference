It does not provide information about the person's mood or happiness.\n\nC. \"My birthday is today\" - This is unrelated to the major premise and does not provide any information about the person's mood or happiness.\n\nD. \"both A and B\" - This means both the person will do well on the test and will be mad. This directly contradicts the major premise because it implies the person will be both happy and unhappy, which is not what the major premise says.\n\nTherefore, the only minor premise that could lead to a valid conclusion is:\n\nA. \"I won't do well on the test\"\n\nThis directly contradicts the major premise and leads to the conclusion that the person will be mad."
