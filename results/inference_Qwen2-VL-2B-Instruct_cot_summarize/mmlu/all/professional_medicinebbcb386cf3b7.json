Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40\u00a0pack-year history, and consumes more than 8\u00a0cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467\u00a0U/L (reference range: 28-100\u00a0U/L) and a\u00a0\u03b3-glutamyltransferase\u00a0level of 212\u00a0U/L (reference range: <\u00a055\u00a0U/L). Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?\n\nA. anterior rami of T1-T5\nB. anterior rami of T6-T10\nC. anterior rami of T11-T12\nD. posterior rami of T1-T5\n"

The patient's symptoms of severe epigastric pain and vomiting are typical of acute pancreatitis, and the elevated serum amylase and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe anterior rami of the spinal cord are responsible for transmitting pain from the periphery to the spinal cord. In this case, the pain is transmitted from the epigastric region to the spinal cord, which is located in the thoracic region. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. anterior rami of T1-T5"
