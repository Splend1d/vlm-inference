The price of a complementary resource increases.\n\nIn a competitive labor market, the equilibrium wage is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. If the price of a complementary resource increases, it shifts the supply curve for the labor market to the right, leading to an increase in the supply of labor. This, in turn, shifts the demand curve for the good produced by the labor market to the right, resulting in a higher equilibrium wage.\n\nThe other options do not directly affect the equilibrium wage:\n\nA. More students graduating with the necessary skills for this labor market does not necessarily increase the market wage because the supply of labor may not increase proportionally.\n\nB. A stronger demand for the good produced by this labor market does not necessarily increase the market wage because the demand curve shifts to the right, but the equilibrium wage may not necessarily increase.\n\nD. Removing the need for workers to pass an exam before they can work in this field does not necessarily increase the market wage because the demand curve shifts to the right, but the equilibrium wage may not necessarily increase."
