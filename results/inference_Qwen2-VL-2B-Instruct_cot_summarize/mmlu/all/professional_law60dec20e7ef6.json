A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?\n\nA. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.\nC. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n"

The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution grants states the right to sue in federal courts and to be sued in state courts. This means that state courts have the authority to interpret and apply state laws, including labor codes, without being subject to federal court jurisdiction. Therefore, the state court has the power to declare the statute constitutional, as it is within the state's jurisdiction to interpret and enforce state laws.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   - This option is incorrect because the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to state laws, and the court would not declare the statute unconstitutional based on this clause.\n\nC. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\n   - This option is incorrect because the regulation of immigration is not preempted by the Eleventh Amendment. The court would not declare the statute unconstitutional based on this principle.\n\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n   - This option is incorrect because the Eleventh Amendment does not preempt economic regulation of illegal aliens. The court would not declare the statute unconstitutional based on this principle."
