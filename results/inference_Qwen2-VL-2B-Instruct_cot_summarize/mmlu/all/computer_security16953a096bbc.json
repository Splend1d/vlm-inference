A U2F USB dongle is designed to provide a second factor of authentication, which is typically a physical factor like a fingerprint or a password, to prevent unauthorized access to the user's computer. This is particularly useful when the user's computer is turned off, as the dongle can still provide a valid authentication method.\n\nStatement 2: A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.\n\nThis statement is also true. U2F (Universal USB 2.0) is a standard for secure authentication that uses a unique identifier (U2F ID) to verify the identity of the user attempting to log in. The server can use this U2F ID to verify the user's identity and ensure that they are indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
