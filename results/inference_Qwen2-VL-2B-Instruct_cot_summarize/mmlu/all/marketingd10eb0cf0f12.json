Penetration pricing involves setting a low price to quickly capture market share and gain customer acceptance. This strategy is often used when the product is new and there is uncertainty about customer demand. By setting a low price, the company can quickly establish a presence in the market and build brand awareness. Once the product has gained market share, the company can then raise prices to reflect the value of the product."
