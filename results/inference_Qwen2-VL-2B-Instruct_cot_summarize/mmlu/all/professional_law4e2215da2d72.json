The patient's doctor prescribed a mild anesthetic drug, to be given to the patient intravenously, to reduce the pain being experienced by the patient. The patient was supposed to receive a saline solution containing 18. 5 milligrams of the drug. A nurse arranged to have a pharmacy technician prepare the solution and drug, and then the nurse administered the solution and drug to the patient. The solution that was administered to the patient contained 185 milligrams of the drug, rather than just 18. 5. Shortly after receiving the drug, the patient had a heart attack and died. The doctor, nurse, and pharmacy technician were all employed by the hospital. If the patient's family brings a wrongful death claim against the hospital, which of the following must the family prove in order to recover damages?\n\nA. The family must identif' which of the three hospital employees involved \u0080\u0094the doctor, nurse, and pharmacy technician \u0080\u0094was actually responsible for the mistake in the dosage of the drug.\nB. The family must prove the specific negligent act that resulted in the wrong dose of the drug being administered.\nC. The family must show that hospital administrators were negligent in hiring or supervising one or more of the employees involved.\nD. The family must prove that the patient would not have died if given 18. 5 milligrams of the drug.\n"
