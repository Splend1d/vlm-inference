The force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers.\n\nKepler's laws of planetary motion are:\n\n1. A planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focus.\n2. The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.\n3. The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.\n4. The time of revolution of a planet is directly proportional to the square of the radius of its orbit.\n5. The square of the speed of a planet is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of its orbit.\n\nThe force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers. This is not directly stated as a law of motion but rather as a fundamental property of gravity."
