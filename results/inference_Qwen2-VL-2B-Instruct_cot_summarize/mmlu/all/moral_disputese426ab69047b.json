Let's break down the premise step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the core of the question**: The core of the question is to determine which phrase in the given premise is deliberately left vague.\n\n2. **Understand the context**: The premise is about the moral obligation to prevent something bad from happening, especially if it can be done without sacrificing something nearly as important.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **A. \"something bad\"**: This phrase is clear and straightforward. It is not left vague.\n   - **B. \"it is wrong\"**: This phrase is also clear and straightforward. It is not left vague.\n   - **C. \"nearly as important\"**: This phrase is clear and straightforward. It is not left vague.\n   - **D. \"in your power\"**: This phrase is not clear and straightforward. It is left vague.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The phrase that is deliberately left vague is **D. \"in your power\"**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D."
