However, the seller agreed with his associate that they would obtain 800 pounds of white fish instead, and tint the white fish with food colors to give it the appearance of the exotic sushi. The real sushi is about 10 times the value of the whitefish. The buyer had signed a contract with the fish seller to purchase the sushi. The seller's associate purchased the white fish and brought it back to seller's fish store to perform the coloring process. When the two men were mixing the colors but before they added it to the fish, an undercover FBI agent who worked on the premises and had recorded some of their discussions, arrested them for conspiracy and attempted criminal fraud. The accused filed a motion to dismiss the attempted fraud charge, arguing that they had not gone far enough for an attempt under the general principles of criminal attempt. Considering those principles, is the trial court likly to grant the motion to dismiss the attempt charge?\n\nA. Yes, because the law of attempt requires more substantial action toward the completion of the crimes then the accused men accomplished under these facts.\nB. Yes, because the fish would have to be delivered to the buyer and payment received from him for there to be a completed attempt.\nC. No, because the act of purchasing the fish and taking it to seller's facility with the criminal intent to color it is sufficient proof of criminal attempt to allow the case to go to the jury.\nD. No, because the agreement to commit criminal fraud by the two co-conspirators, combined with the act of mixing the colors, constituted sufficient proof of an attempt to commit the crime.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the trial court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss the attempt charge, we need to analyze the elements of the crime and the actions taken by the accused men.\n\n1. **Nature of the Crime**: The accused men agreed to sell 800 pounds of sushi to a wholesale buyer, but instead, they purchased 800 pounds of white fish and tinted it with food colors. This is a violation of the contract and constitutes a crime.\n\n2. **Elements of the Attempt Charge**: To be found guilty of an attempt to commit a crime, the accused must have:\n   - A criminal intent to commit the crime.\n   - A substantial step toward the completion of the crime.\n   - The crime must be capable of being completed.\n\n3. **Substantial Step Toward Completion**: The accused men did not go far enough for an attempt under the general principles of criminal attempt. They did not purchase the fish, mix the colors, or deliver it to the buyer. They only purchased the fish and took it to the seller's fish store.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The act of purchasing the fish and taking it to the seller's facility with the criminal intent to color it is sufficient proof of criminal intent. The act of purchasing the fish is not sufficient to constitute an attempt because it does not involve the substantial step toward the completion of the crime.\n\nGiven these points, the trial court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss the attempt charge because the act of purchasing the fish and taking it to the seller's facility with the criminal intent to color it is sufficient proof of criminal intent.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. No, because the agreement to commit criminal fraud by the two co-conspirators, combined with the act of mixing the colors, constituted sufficient proof of an attempt to commit the crime."
