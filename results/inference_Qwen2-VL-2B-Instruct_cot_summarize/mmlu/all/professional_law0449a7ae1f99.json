One day, a truck driver pulled into the gas station for some gas. After filling up the gas tank, the truck driver entered the convenience store for a bite to eat. He was eating a bowl of chili when he noticed a cockroach in the food. The truck driver demanded a new serving of chili. When the owner refused, the truck driver stormed out of the store in anger. The truck driver jumped into his truck and decided to get even by causing some damage. He purposely drove into one of the gas tanks, which ruptured the gas line. The collision caused a terrible explosion and the building became engulfed in flames. The owner could not escape the blaze and burned to death. At common law, the truck driver should be found guilty of\n\nA. arson only.\nB. murder only.\nC. arson and murder.\nD. arson, burglary, and murder.\n"

Arson involves the intentional setting of fire to cause damage or injury, while murder involves the intentional killing of another person. The truck driver's actions of driving into the gas tanks and causing a terrible explosion and the building to become engulfed in flames can be considered arson. Additionally, the truck driver's intent to cause harm to the building and its occupants, including the owner and his family, can be considered murder. Therefore, the truck driver should be found guilty of both arson and murder."
