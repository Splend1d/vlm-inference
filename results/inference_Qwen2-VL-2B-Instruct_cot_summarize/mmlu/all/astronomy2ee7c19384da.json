The seasons on Mars are called \"hemispheres\" because they are divided into two distinct regions, the northern and southern hemispheres. The northern hemisphere is warmer than the southern hemisphere because it receives more sunlight during the summer months. The southern hemisphere is cooler than the northern hemisphere because it receives less sunlight during the summer months."
