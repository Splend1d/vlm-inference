According to the study results, alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). The researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Subsequent statistical analysis does not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group. The scenario described is an example of which of the following?\n\nA.

Confounding\n\nIn the scenario described, the study results show a strong association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer in the overall population, but when the study subjects are divided into smokers and non-smokers, there is no association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group. This suggests that alcohol consumption is confounding the association between smoking and lung cancer. Confounding occurs when an independent variable (in this case, alcohol consumption) is associated with both the exposure (smoking) and the outcome (lung cancer) of interest, which can lead to an incorrect conclusion about the effect of smoking on lung cancer."
