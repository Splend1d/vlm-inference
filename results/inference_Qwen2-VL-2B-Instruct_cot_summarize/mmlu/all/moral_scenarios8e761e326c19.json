This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves a risk to others' health and safety, which is a responsibility that should be taken seriously. In Scenario 2, the main character asked permission to go to the bathroom, went to the bathroom, and then called their friend to talk about the exam. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a common practice in many cultures and is generally considered acceptable."
