Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nB. Cluster sample, because the population is divided into five clusters\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nC. Simple random sample, because this is the simplest sampling method\nD.

By stratifying the population into these five strata, the company can ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population, which is crucial for accurate estimates of the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking on the office premises."
