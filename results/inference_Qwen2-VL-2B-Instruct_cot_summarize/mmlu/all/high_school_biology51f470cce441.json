                    "text": "To determine which statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies, let's analyze each option in the context of the geneticist Mary Lyon's hypothesis and the subsequent naming of Barr bodies.\n\n1. **Option A: In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell.**\n   - This statement is correct. In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome is inactivated in every body cell, which is a fundamental aspect of the X-inactivation mechanism.\n\n2. **Option B: The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.**\n   - This statement is also correct. In a normal female, every cell has the same chromosome configuration, and therefore, every cell is inactivated.\n\n3. **Option C: A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. A male with the XXY genotype will have two Barr bodies, not one. This is because the XXY genotype indicates that the male has two X chromosomes, and the X chromosome in the male is inactivated in every cell, resulting in two Barr bodies.\n\n4. **Option D: Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA.**\n   - This statement is correct. Barr bodies are known to consist of highly methylated DNA, which is a characteristic feature of the inactivated X chromosome in females.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is NOT correct is:\n\n**Option C: A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C."
