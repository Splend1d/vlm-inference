                    "text": "To determine which change in westward migration is most likely to have occurred in the 1840s, let's analyze the context and the passage provided.\n\nThe passage discusses the future of the United States, emphasizing its potential to become a great nation and its role in the world. It mentions the vastness of the future and the potential for the nation to manifest divine principles and establish a \"temple\" on earth dedicated to the worship of the Most High.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased.\n- This option suggests a shift in migration patterns, with fewer pioneers heading west to Oregon and more to California. This could be a plausible change in the 1840s, as the passage mentions the vastness of the future and the potential for the nation to become great, which could lead to a focus on expanding westward.\n\nB. The first great wave of migration ended, and the number of migrants remained extremely low until after the Civil War.\n- This option suggests a decline in migration after the Civil War, which is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does not provide information about the end of the first great wave or the continuation of low migration after the Civil War.\n\nC. For the first time, pioneers began to settle areas west of the Mississippi River.\n- This option suggests a change in the timing of pioneer settlement, but it does not directly relate to the vastness of the future or the potential for the nation to become great.\n\nD. Large numbers of free blacks, unwelcome in the East, began to resettle in the West.\n- This option suggests a change in the demographics of the West, but it does not directly relate to the vastness of the future or the potential for the nation to become great.\n\nGiven the context and the passage, the most likely change in westward migration in the 1840s is:\n\nA. The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased.\n\nFinal answer: A."
