The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. In July the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but stating that \"shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20.\" When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?\n\nA. Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.\nB. Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.\nC. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\nD. No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the manufacturer will prevail in enforcing a contract, we need to analyze the terms of the contract and the actions taken by both parties.\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**: The retailer ordered 100 computers from the manufacturer, with various configurations, and the order was accepted by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's confirmation of acceptance explicitly stated that the shipment would be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20.\n\n2. **Contract Terms**: The offer expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. This means that the retailer agreed to the terms of the offer, which were the delivery schedule and the number of computers.\n\n3. **Action Taken by the Retailer**: The retailer withdrew the order after the shipment was not made by August 1. This withdrawal occurred before the machines were shipped.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A**: \"Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.\"\n  - This option suggests that the difference between the offer and acceptance was minimal. However, the offer explicitly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer, and the retailer's withdrawal occurred before the machines were shipped. This indicates that the retailer did not assent to the terms of the offer, which is a key requirement for enforcing a contract.\n\n- **Option B**: \"Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.\"\n  - This option suggests that the retailer remained silent until after the deadline, which is a common defense for a contract to be voided due to a breach of contract. However, the retailer's withdrawal occurred before the machines were shipped, which means the retailer did not breach the contract.\n\n- **Option C**: \"No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\"\n  - This option suggests that the offer explicitly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. Since the offer explicitly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer, the retailer did not assent to the terms of the offer, and therefore, the manufacturer cannot enforce the contract.\n\n- **Option D**: \"No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\"\n  - This option suggests that the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped. However, the retailer's withdrawal occurred after the machines were shipped, which means the retailer did not breach the contract.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.**"
