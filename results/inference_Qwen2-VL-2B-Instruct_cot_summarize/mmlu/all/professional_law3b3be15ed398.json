During finals at the end of the fall semester, the student was caught cheating. His chemistry professor saw him looking at a fellow student's exam paper and copying the answers to three multiple choice questions. The professor notified the honor committee, which immediately found an honor code violation and ordered that the student receive a failing grade in the course. In addition, in accordance with the rules of the university, the student's financial aid was terminated. The student filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement of his financial aid. The student's only argument was that his due process rights were violated in that he did not receive a notice of, or a hearing on, the alleged honor code violation. Which of the following facts, if true, would be most helpful to the student?\n\nA. The university was in financial difficulties and could not meet its payroll expenses.\nB. The university did not re-allocate the student's financial aid to another deserving student.\nC. The university received support from the state.\nD. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n"

The student's due process rights are generally protected by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This means that the student had a right to receive a fair hearing and to be informed of the charges against him before a hearing can be held.\n\nGiven this context, the most helpful fact for the student would be:\n\nD. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n\nThis would provide the student with notice of the hearing and an opportunity to present his side of the case, which is essential for ensuring that his due process rights are respected. Without such notice, the student would not have had the opportunity to challenge the honor code violation and could potentially have been denied reinstatement of his financial aid."
