Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory.\nB. The centre of the security studies debate has been to give form to policy questions - strategy, economy of defence, decision making - and to the systematic division of labour that has governed those distinctions.\nC. Security theory is a specific subset of security studies and one whose development has gone through distinctive phases and divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition.\nD. Security debates structured scholarship centred on offensive versus defensive realism, the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires.\n"

Security theory is a specific subset of security studies and one whose development has gone through distinctive phases and divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition.\n\nSecurity theory is a specific subset of security studies, which is a broader field that encompasses various disciplines such as international relations, political science, and economics. Security theory has gone through distinctive phases and has divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition. This means that security theory is a distinct and separate field within the broader field of security studies."
