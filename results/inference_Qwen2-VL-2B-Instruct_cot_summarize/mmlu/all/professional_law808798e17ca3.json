When the crane was manufactured, some of the welding of its parts was done improperly. No one had ever noticed this manufacturing defect in the crane. The defect caused the crane to break and topple over. Part of the crane fell on the doctor's car. The doctor's car was completely destroyed. The car was valued at $35,000. The doctor had auto insurance, and the insurance company promptly paid the doctor $35,000 under the insurance policy. If the doctor brings suit against the manufacturer of the crane, will the doctor prevail?\n\nA. No, because the doctor had auto insurance, so she suffered no loss.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was unaware of the defect in the crane.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer failed to inspect the crane adequately before selling it.\n"

Yes, because the manufacturer failed to inspect the crane adequately before selling it.\n\nWhen a product is sold, the manufacturer has a duty to ensure that the product is safe and free from defects. If the manufacturer fails to inspect the crane adequately before selling it, it can be considered a breach of the duty of care. This breach can result in liability for the manufacturer, even if the doctor had auto insurance and did not suffer any loss directly from the accident.\n\nIn this case, the crane was defective due to a manufacturing defect, which was not noticed by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's failure to inspect the crane adequately before selling it can be considered a breach of the duty of care, and the doctor may have a valid claim against the manufacturer for negligence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
