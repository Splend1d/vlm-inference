To find the next ID number, we add 1 to this number:\n\n1001 0011 + 1 = 1001 0012\n\nNow, we convert this binary number to decimal to understand its value:\n\n1001 0012 = 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, the next ID number is 9, which is 1001 0012 in binary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1001 0100"
