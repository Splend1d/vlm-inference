The first showed 58% and the second 13% because of response bias due to the wording of the questions.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Option A** suggests that the 58% and 13% results are due to the lack of randomization, which is a common issue in surveys and questionnaires.\n- **Option B** suggests that the 58% and 13% results are due to a placebo effect, which is a common phenomenon where participants respond to a treatment they believe they are receiving, even if it is not actually present.\n- **Option C** suggests that the 58% and 13% results are due to the lack of a control group, which is a common issue in research where participants are not randomly assigned to different conditions.\n- **Option D** suggests that the 58% and 13% results are due to response bias, which is a type of bias where participants' responses are influenced by the wording of the questions, making it difficult to determine the true effect of the budget increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as it directly addresses the issue of response bias due to the wording of the questions."
