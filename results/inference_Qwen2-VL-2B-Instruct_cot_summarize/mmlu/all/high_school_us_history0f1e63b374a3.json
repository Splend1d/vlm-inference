A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective\u2014a new world order\u2014can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.\n\u2014President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990\nPresident Bush's \"new world order\" most directly resembles which of the following?\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine\nB. Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\"\nC. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points\nD. Containment policy toward the Soviet Union\n"

The Monroe Doctrine - This doctrine was established by the United States in the 19th century and stated that the United States would not intervene in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. It was not related to a new world order.\n\nB. Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" - This refers to the use of military force as a means of diplomacy, which was not the focus of President Bush's speech.\n\nC. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points - This was a set of principles proposed by Woodrow Wilson in 1918 to guide the peace negotiations after World War I. It was not related to a new world order.\n\nD. Containment policy toward the Soviet Union - This refers to the policy of preventing the spread of communism by containing the Soviet Union and its allies. It was not the focus of President Bush's speech.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that the most directly resembling \"new world order\" mentioned by President Bush is:\n\nC. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points\n\nThis is because it aligns with the idea of a new era of cooperation and peace, which is a central theme of President Bush's speech."
