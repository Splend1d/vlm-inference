This action is morally wrong because it involves using a hammer to physically harm their wife, which is a violent and harmful act. In scenario 2, the main character uses \"I\" to describe their action of leaving town without picking up their kid from school. This action is also morally wrong because it involves abandoning their child, which is a violation of their duty as a parent."
