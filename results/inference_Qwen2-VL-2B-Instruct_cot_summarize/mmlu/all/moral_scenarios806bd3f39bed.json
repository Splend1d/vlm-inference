According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is generally considered morally wrong for a parent to bring their child to a show where the content is considered inappropriate or harmful for their age group. This is because it can expose the child to potentially harmful or inappropriate content, which can have long-lasting effects on their development and understanding of the world.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character went fishing for dolphins last weekend. This is generally considered morally wrong because it involves the killing of a species that is considered endangered or protected by law. It is illegal to hunt or kill dolphins, and it is considered cruel and inhumane to take them from the wild for human consumption or entertainment. This is because it violates the rights of the animals and can cause them suffering and pain."
