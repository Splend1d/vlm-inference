                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.\n\nAngular momentum (L) is defined as the product of the mass (m) of an object and its angular velocity (\u03c9) around an axis. Mathematically, it is expressed as L = m\u03c9.\n\nWhen the man throws a baseball to his friend, the baseball's angular momentum is transferred to the man. This is because the baseball's motion is transferred to the man's motion as he catches the baseball. The baseball's angular momentum is transferred to the man's angular momentum because the baseball's motion is perpendicular to the man's motion.\n\nWhen the man throws his arms out, he is not transferring angular momentum to the baseball. Instead, he is transferring angular momentum to himself. This is because the baseball's motion is perpendicular to the man's motion, and the man's motion is not transferring angular momentum to the baseball.\n\nWhen the man throws his arms out and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again, he is not transferring angular momentum to the baseball. Instead, he is transferring angular momentum to himself. This is because the baseball's motion is perpendicular to the man's motion, and the man's motion is not transferring angular momentum to the baseball.\n\nWhen the man jumps straight up in the air and lands back on the platform, he is transferring angular momentum to himself. This is because the baseball's motion is perpendicular to the man's motion, and the man's motion is not transferring angular momentum to the baseball.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body."
