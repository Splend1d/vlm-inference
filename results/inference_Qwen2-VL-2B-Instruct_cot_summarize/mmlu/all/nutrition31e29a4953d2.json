Reliable dose-response data are difficult to acquire and often unavailable\n\nObservational epidemiology studies are useful for identifying health effects of food contaminants because they can provide insights into the relationship between exposure to a contaminant and the occurrence of health outcomes. However, they are not suitable for assessing risk because they do not provide information on the dose-response relationship between exposure and health effects. This is because dose-response data are often difficult to obtain and are often unavailable, making it difficult to determine the magnitude of exposure required to cause a particular health effect."
