He contacted the stadium's ticket sales office, which advised him that all tickets were to be placed on sale at the stadium at 9:00 a. m. the following day. The fan, who was employed as a bricklayer, realized that he could not leave work to purchase the tickets. Consequently, the fan telephoned his next-door neighbor and asked him if he would be interested in going to the stadium to purchase the baseball tickets. The neighbor told the fan that he would be happy to purchase the tickets for him and that he (the neighbor) also wanted to buy tickets for himself. However, the neighbor said that his car had broken down and that he did not have available transportation to get to the stadium. The fan suggested that he could lend his car to the neighbor. The neighbor agreed, and the following morning the two men met in front of the fan's home. The fan gave the neighbor the keys to his car and also money with which to buy his baseball tickets. Thereafter, the neighbor drove the fan's car to the stadium where he purchased the tickets for the fan and (using his own money) also bought a set of tickets for himself. The fan had instructed the neighbor to return the car to the fan's home after his trip to the stadium. After the neighbor left the stadium, however, he decided to visit a friend in a town located 120 miles from his home. As the neighbor was driving toward the town, an automobile crashed into him, causing significant damage to the fan's car. The cost of repairing the fan's car was determined to be more than the retail value of the auto. In an action by the fan against the neighbor to recover damages resulting from the accident, the fan will most likely\n\nA. recover nothing, because the neighbor was on a joint venture when the accident occurred.\nB. recover the cost of repairing the car.\nC. recover the retail value of the car.\nD. recover, because the neighbor was negligently operating the auto at the time of the accident.\n"

Negligence is a legal concept that pertains to the failure to exercise reasonable care or prudence in the performance of a duty owed to another person. In this case, the neighbor was on a joint venture with the fan, and the fan had instructed the neighbor to return the car to his home after the trip to the stadium. The neighbor's decision to visit his friend in a town located 120 miles from his home was not a reasonable or prudent action, as it could have resulted in a significant accident. Therefore, the neighbor's negligence in operating the car at the time of the accident is a valid basis for the fan to recover damages."
