A group of adjoining landowners who owned single-family residences sued for an injunction, alleging various environmental violations. The developer did not have a significant investment at that point, and decided to stop the construction.Shortly thereafter, the city passed a comprehensive new citywide zoning law that re-zoned the subject property and some large tracts of adjoining land to low-density residential, allowing one residence for each 4.6 acres. This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?\n\nA. Yes, the state cannot cause such a dramatic diminution in an owner's property without paying just compensation.\nB. Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval \u0080\u0093 the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.\nC. Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.\nD. No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.\n"

However, the city's new zoning law did not take away the developer's property; it merely changed the use of the land. The developer's loss was due to the city's new zoning law, not the state.\n   \n   - **Option B: Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval \u0080\u0093 the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.**\n     - This option suggests that the developer relied on the building permit to proceed with construction. However, the city's new zoning law was not illegal; it was a comprehensive new zoning law that re-zoned the property. The developer's reliance on the building permit was not the cause of the loss.\n   \n   - **Option C: Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.**\n     - This option suggests that the discriminatory zoning took away the developer's property without due process. However, the city's new zoning law did not discriminate against the developer; it simply re-zoned the property to allow one residence for each 4.6 acres. The developer's loss was due to the city's new zoning law, not the discriminatory zoning.\n   \n   - **Option D: No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.**\n     - This option suggests that the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners. However, the city's new zoning law was not a comprehensive new zoning plan; it was a re-zoning of a single property. The developer's loss was due to the city's new zoning law, not the adjoining owners.\n\nGiven the analysis, the developer's loss was due to the city's new zoning law, not the state or the adjoining landowners. Therefore, the developer will not prevail with his federal constitutional claim.\n\n**Final Answer: D. No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.**"
