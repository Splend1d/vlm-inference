The probability of drawing a green ball is $\\frac{5}{5+k}$, and the probability of drawing a purple ball is $\\frac{k}{5+k}$. The expected amount won is therefore\n\\[\\frac{5}{5+k} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{k}{5+k} \\cdot -2 = \\frac{10}{5+k} - \\frac{2k}{5+k} = \\frac{10-2k}{5+k}.\\]\nWe are given that this is equal to 50 cents, or $\\frac{1}{2}$ dollars. So we have the equation\n\\[\\frac{10-2k}{5+k} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $2(5+k)$ gives\n\\[2(10-2k) = 5+k.\\]\nExpanding the left side gives\n\\[20 - 4k = 5 + k.\\]\nRearranging terms gives\n\\[5k = 15.\\]\nDividing both sides by 5 gives $k = 3$. So the value of $k$ is 3, which corresponds to option C. The answer is: C"
