Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same.

                    "text": "To determine which factor is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage, let's analyze the context and the speaker's statements.\n\nThe first passage is from Olympe de Gouges, a French revolutionary who wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen in 1791. The passage discusses the rights of women and the challenges faced by women during the French Revolution. The second passage is from Halima Ghomri, an Algerian woman who was interviewed in the 1970s after Algeria's war of independence. The passage discusses the lack of progress in education for her children and the ongoing struggle for social reform.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism - This option suggests that the lack of progress in education for women was due to the persistence of traditional Islamic values and customs. However, the passage does not explicitly mention Islamic traditionalism as a factor preventing progress.\n\nB. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure - This option suggests that the lack of progress in education for women was due to the absence of industrial assets or infrastructure. The passage does not provide any information about the lack of industrial assets or infrastructure.\n\nC. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites - This option suggests that the lack of progress in education for women was due to the hostility of new elites towards women's rights. The passage does not explicitly mention the hostility of new elites towards women's rights.\n\nD. Prioritization of national liberation over social reform - This option suggests that the lack of progress in education for women was due to the prioritization of national liberation over social reform. The passage does not explicitly mention the prioritization of national liberation over social reform.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that the passage does not explicitly mention any of these factors. Therefore, none of the options provided are the likeliest factor preventing the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage.\n\nFinal answer: None of the given factors are the likeliest factor preventing the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage."
