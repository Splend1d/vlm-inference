It is a business model that aims to create social impact while also generating financial returns for shareholders. The model is based on the idea that businesses can be used as a tool for social change, and that by using their resources and expertise, they can help to address social issues and create positive change in society. The model is often used in developing countries, where social issues are often more pressing than in developed countries."
