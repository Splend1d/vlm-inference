A worker donating $200 to the Red Cross.\n\nU.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced in the economy. This includes not only the value of goods and services produced by businesses but also the value of goods and services provided by individuals and households.\n\nOption C, where a worker donates $200 to the Red Cross, is an example of an individual providing a service to the public. This donation is not a business activity but rather a charitable act, which is included in GDP calculations as it represents a transfer of value from the individual to the public sector.\n\nOption A, where an auto mechanic fixes a dentist's car, is an example of a business activity. It is included in GDP calculations as it represents the value of the car fixed by the business.\n\nOption B, where a stay-at-home dad provides childcare for his children, is also an example of a business activity. It is included in GDP calculations as it represents the value of the services provided by the business.\n\nOption D, where high school students build homes for the homeless, is an example of a business activity. It is included in GDP calculations as it represents the value of the homes built by the business.\n\nTherefore, the only option that would be included in U.S. GDP calculations is C."
