Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, \"No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Complete blood count\nC. Determination of serum albumin concentration\nD. Determination of serum digoxin level\n"

Determination of serum digoxin level\n\nThis is because digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is commonly prescribed for congestive heart failure, and its levels can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the medication and assess the patient's response to treatment. A low serum digoxin level could indicate that the patient is not receiving the medication as prescribed, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms."
