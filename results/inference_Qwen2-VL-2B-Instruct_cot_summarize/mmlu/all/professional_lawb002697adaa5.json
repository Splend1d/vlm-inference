Delivery by April 1. \"On March 8, the company shipped 300 sheets of 1/2-inch refabricated aluminum siding, which were received by the builder on March 10. The following day, the builder sent the following fax to the company: \"Be advised that your shipment is rejected. Order stipulated 1/4-inch sheets. \" This fax was received by the company, but the builder did not ship the nonconforming aluminum sheets back to the company. Did the builder properly reject the shipment delivered on March 10?\n\nA. Yes, because the aluminum sheets were nonconforming goods.\nB.

No, because the builder waived its right to reject the nonconforming goods by not returning them promptly to the company.**"
