In scenario 2, the main character took out their phone before the movie started, which is generally considered a violation of movie etiquette and could be seen as disrespectful to the moviegoers around them. However, it is important to note that the main character's actions in scenario 2 are not necessarily morally wrong, as they are not explicitly against any known moral standards in the US as of 2020."
