The toxicologist testified that the defendant's blood alcohol level, registered after his arrest, was 0. 14%. At the close of the toxicologist's testimony, the trial judge, over defense objections, instructed the jury that, in accordance with state law, a person with a blood alcohol level greater than 0. 10% is presumed to be intoxicated. No other instruction relating to that presumption was given. A relevant statute in this jurisdiction makes driving while intoxicated a felony and defines intoxication \"as a state of severely impaired mental and physical capacity caused by the ingestion of drugs or alcohol. \"The defendant was subsequently convicted of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, his conviction should be\n\nA. affirmed, because the defendant had an opportunity to rebut the presumption.\nB. affirmed, because the judge's instruction merely permitted the jury to reach a conclusion that they could have decided upon without the presumption.\nC. reversed, because the jury might determine that the instruction in effect relieves the prosecutor of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. reversed, because such an instruction may be considered an indication of guilt and, therefore, violative of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n"

The defendant's conviction was upheld, and the appeal was based on the instruction given by the trial judge.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Affirmed, because the defendant had an opportunity to rebut the presumption.**\n   - This option suggests that the defendant had the opportunity to challenge the presumption of intoxication. However, the instruction given by the judge was clear and stated that the jury could reach a conclusion based on the presumption. The defendant did not have the opportunity to challenge the presumption, as the instruction was clear and did not allow for rebuttal.\n\nB. **Affirmed, because the judge's instruction merely permitted the jury to reach a conclusion that they could have decided upon without the presumption.**\n   - This option implies that the instruction merely allowed the jury to reach a conclusion based on the presumption, but did not relieve the prosecutor of the burden of proof. However, the instruction did not relieve the prosecutor of the burden of proof; it merely allowed the jury to consider the presumption in their decision-making process.\n\nC. **Reversed, because the jury might determine that the instruction in effect relieves the prosecutor of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.**\n   - This option suggests that the jury might have determined that the instruction relieved the prosecutor of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the instruction did not relieve the prosecutor of the burden of proof; it merely allowed the jury to consider the presumption in their decision-making process.\n\nD. **Reversed, because such an instruction may be considered an indication of guilt and, therefore, violative of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.**\n   - This option suggests that the instruction may have been considered an indication of guilt and, therefore, violative of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. However, the instruction did not indicate guilt; it merely allowed the jury to consider the presumption in their decision-making process.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Affirmed, because the judge's instruction merely permitted the jury to reach a conclusion that they could have decided upon without the presumption.**\n\nFinal answer: B. Affirmed, because the judge's instruction merely permitted the jury to reach a conclusion that they could have decided upon without the presumption."
