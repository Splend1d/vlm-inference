                    "text": "A defendant was being prosecuted on a charge of manslaughter in the first degree for causing the death of a 15-year-old girl on whom he had allegedly performed an abortion in his private clinic. A witness for the defendant testified to the defendant's non-culpability at the grand jury proceeding. The witness was later called as a defense witness at the trial. During his direct examination, defendant's attorney asked him, \"Is it not true that the defendant could not have performed the abortion on the decedent since he was assisting you in another abortion at the time?\" The witness answers in the negative and states that the defendant did, in fact, perform the abortion on the girl. The defendant's attorney then assails the witness's testimony as a recent fabrication, and asks the witness if he had not stated to a grand jury that the defendant was not guilty of performing the abortion, thus causing the death of the girl. The prosecutor objects to this question. The trial judge should rule that this question is\n\nA. objectionable, because the defendant's attorney did not lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness.\nB. objectionable, because a party may not impeach his own witness.\nC. unobjectionable, because a witness's testimony before a grand jury is more reliable because it occurred shortly after the abortion was allegedly performed.\nD. unobjectionable, because a party can impeach his own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n"

The defendant's attorney asked the witness if he had not stated to a grand jury that the defendant was not guilty of performing the abortion, thus causing the death of the girl. This question is directed at the witness's credibility and reliability, which is a core aspect of the witness's testimony.\n\n2. The witness's testimony was given during the grand jury proceeding, which is a separate proceeding from the trial. The grand jury proceeding is typically a formal and structured process where witnesses are sworn in and given the opportunity to provide their testimony under oath. The grand jury proceedings are designed to ensure that the testimony is reliable and credible.\n\n3. The trial judge should not allow the defendant's attorney to question the witness about his prior inconsistent statements made to the grand jury. This would be a violation of the witness's right to a fair and impartial trial, as it would undermine the witness's credibility and reliability.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should rule that this question is objectionable because it is a violation of the witness's right to a fair and impartial trial."
