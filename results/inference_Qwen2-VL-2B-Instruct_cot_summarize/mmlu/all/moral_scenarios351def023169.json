This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves intentionally causing harm to an animal. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) guided the plane into the tallest mountain that they could see. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a decision made by a professional pilot based on their expertise and the safety of the passengers and crew."
