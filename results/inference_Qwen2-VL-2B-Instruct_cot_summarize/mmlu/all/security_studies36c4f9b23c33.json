The need for civilian expertise, a need driven by technological developments, resulted in a shift from targeted development of fast-changing technologies to deployment of a given technology.\nB. Theory was necessary because nuclear technology was inherently more empirical, seen as what would be controlled by the bottom line of probable occurrences in a given conflict situation - the game of deterrence.\nC. Broader political considerations about the potential implications of long-term mobilization resulted in a shift from tactical operations to long-term strategy.\nD. The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.\n"

The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.\n\nIn the context of security studies, institutional innovation often involves the development of new frameworks, institutions, or practices to address new challenges or to improve existing ones. The factors you mentioned are all relevant to the development of security studies as an institutional innovation. However, the combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations is particularly significant because it required a highly cohesive and strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political, and military planning. This was a significant factor in the development of security studies as an institutional innovation."
