Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n"
