The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.\nB. The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\nC. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\nD. The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n"

The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Handyman's Responsibility**: The handyman was contracted to repair the microwave for $100, but he failed to deliver it on time. This is a breach of contract, which is a legal cause of action.\n\n2. **Repair Store's Responsibility**: The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80, but it failed to do so within the agreed timeframe. This is also a breach of contract, which is a legal cause of action.\n\n3. **Woman's Position**: The woman delivered the microwave to the handyman, and the handyman failed to deliver it on time. This is a breach of contract, which is a legal cause of action.\n\n4. **Legal Position**: Since the repair store failed to deliver the microwave on time, it is considered a breach of contract. The repair store is the one who breached the contract, and therefore, the woman has a cause of action against the repair store.\n\n5. **Handyman's Position**: The handyman was contracted to repair the microwave for $100, but he failed to deliver it on time. This is a breach of contract, which is a legal cause of action.\n\n6. **Woman's Position**: The woman delivered the microwave to the handyman, and the handyman failed to deliver it on time. This is a breach of contract, which is a legal cause of action.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman."
