The Japanese model is applied, through lateral networks of flexible roles.\n\nThe alternative form of 'network organization' refers to a system where work is subcontracted out to independent suppliers and retailers, which is not the case in the Japanese model. The Japanese model emphasizes a decentralized and flexible approach to business operations, where roles are not rigidly defined and can be reassigned as needed. This approach is often characterized by lateral networks of flexible roles, where individuals can move between different roles and responsibilities as needed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
