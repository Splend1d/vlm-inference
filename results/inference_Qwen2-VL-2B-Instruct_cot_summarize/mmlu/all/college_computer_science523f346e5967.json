                    "text": "To determine which of the statements are true about \"Magic memory,\" we need to analyze the operations and functionality of \"Magic memory\" based on the given information.\n\n1. **Read Operation**: This operation returns the number of Read operations since the last Clear operation.\n2. **Clear Operation**: This operation sets the magic memory to zero.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement:\n\n**I. It can provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set.**\n- **Read Operation**: This operation returns the number of Read operations since the last Clear operation. This means that the number of Read operations is a count of the number of times the memory has been read. This is similar to an atomic test-and-set operation, where the value of the memory is set to a new value only after all tests have been passed.\n- **Clear Operation**: This operation sets the memory to zero. This is similar to an atomic test-and-set operation where the memory is set to zero only after all tests have been passed.\n\n**II. It can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor.**\n- **Read Operation**: This operation returns the number of Read operations since the last Clear operation. This means that the number of Read operations is a count of the number of times the memory has been read. This can be used to track the number of times a process has read from the memory, which can be useful for coordinating processes.\n- **Clear Operation**: This operation sets the memory to zero. This can be used to clear the memory to zero, which can be useful for resetting the memory to a known state.\n\n**III. It is only useful on a multiprocessor.**\n- **Read Operation**: This operation returns the number of Read operations since the last Clear operation. This means that the number of Read operations is a count of the number of times the memory has been read. This can be useful on a multiprocessor to track the number of times a process has read from the memory.\n- **Clear Operation**: This operation sets the memory to zero. This can be useful on a multiprocessor to clear the memory to zero, which can be useful for resetting the memory to a known state.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are true because they both utilize the Read and Clear operations of \"Magic memory\" in a way that is useful on a multiprocessor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. I and II"
