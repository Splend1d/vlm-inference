This is because the symptoms of depression can be overwhelming and can lead to feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and despair, which can make it difficult for individuals to seek help or to take steps to prevent suicide. As they begin to recover from their depression, individuals may become more confident in their ability to cope with their symptoms and may be less likely to engage in suicidal behavior."
