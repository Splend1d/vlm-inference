Brent works nights, so he chooses to buy bread at 7 a.m. rather than at 7 p.m.\n\nPrice discrimination occurs when a seller charges different prices for the same product or service to different buyers based on their willingness and ability to pay. In this case, Brent is choosing to buy bread at 7 a.m. rather than 7 p.m. because he is willing to pay a higher price for bread at 7 a.m. compared to 7 p.m. Therefore, this situation is an example of price discrimination."
