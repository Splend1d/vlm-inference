Because they are inconsistent with state control.\n\nMarxist theory of law, as developed by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Lenin, rejects individual rights as a means of state control. They argue that individual rights are inherently incompatible with the state's ability to control and regulate the economy and society. In a socialist society, where the state is the primary institution of control, individual rights are seen as a hindrance to achieving social and economic equality. The state's role is to ensure the collective well-being of the population, and individual rights are seen as a barrier to this goal."
