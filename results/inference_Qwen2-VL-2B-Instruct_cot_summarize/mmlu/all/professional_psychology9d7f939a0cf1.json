CBT is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety. It involves a structured approach to addressing anxiety symptoms, including cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy, and mindfulness techniques. Social skills training and behavioral activation treatment are also effective for addressing anxiety symptoms, but they may require more ongoing support and practice than CBT. Nondirective supportive treatment is not typically used for addressing anxiety symptoms and may not be as effective as other treatment methods."
