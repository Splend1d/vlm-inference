The policy contains a clause providing that double indemnity is payable in the event that death of the insured \"results directly, and independently of all other causes, from bodily injury effected solely through external violent and accidental means. \"The plaintiff's wife met her death in the silage shed of her farm. The death resulted from wounds caused by the discharge of a double-barreled shotgun. The plaintiff was arrested and prosecuted for the murder of his wife. After a lengthy trial, the plaintiff was acquitted of the charge. After the insurance company refused to pay the plaintiff's insurance claim, the plaintiff instituted this civil action. The complaint sets forth the policy, alleges the facts surrounding the death of the insured, avers that the death was within the policy provisions for double indemnity payment, and demands judgment accordingly. At trial, the insurance company's attorney proposes to introduce excerpts from the plaintiff's murder trial. The plaintiff's attorney objects to the introduction of such evidence. The trial judge should rule the proffered evidence\n\nA. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible as former testimony.\nC. inadmissible, because of collateral estoppel.\nD. inadmissible, because of double jeopardy.\n"

Collateral estoppel occurs when a court precludes the\u5f53\u4e8b\u4eba from relitigating the same issue in a subsequent proceeding. In this case, the plaintiff's attorney is arguing that the evidence from the murder trial should not be admitted because it would be considered evidence of the plaintiff's guilt and would prejudice the plaintiff's ability to prove his innocence in the civil action.\n\nThe trial judge should rule that the proffered evidence is inadmissible because of collateral estoppel. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. inadmissible, because of collateral estoppel."
