If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax.\n\nIf the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price of good X will rise by the amount of the tax. This is because in an elastic demand market, a price increase will lead to a large increase in quantity demanded, resulting in a large increase in revenue for the producer. Therefore, the price will rise by the amount of the tax to cover the tax revenue.\n\nB. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is more elastic.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The burden of the tax on consumers is determined by the elasticity of demand, not by the demand curve's shape. If the demand curve is more elastic, the price will rise by the amount of the tax, and the burden on consumers will also rise by the same amount. Therefore, the burden of the tax on consumers will not necessarily rise as the demand curve is more elastic.\n\nC. Consumer surplus rises as a result of the tax.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The tax will reduce consumer surplus because the price will rise by the amount of the tax, and consumers will be willing to buy less of the good. Therefore, consumer surplus will decrease as a result of the tax.\n\nD. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The burden of the tax on consumers is determined by the elasticity of demand, not by the demand curve's shape. If the demand curve is less elastic, the price will rise by the amount of the tax, and the burden on consumers will also rise by the same amount. Therefore, the burden of the tax on consumers will not necessarily rise as the demand curve is less elastic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
