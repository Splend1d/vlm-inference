The wage would fall, but employment would increase.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive labor market, there are many employers and many workers, and each worker has many potential employers. This leads to a high degree of competition, which drives down wages. Additionally, in a perfectly competitive labor market, there is no employer power to influence wages, so the wage is determined by the market supply and demand for labor. As a result, the wage would fall, and the number of workers would increase to find jobs in the new market."
