It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.\n\nWhen the external pH is low, the mitochondria produce ATP by pumping protons (H+) out of the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. This process is known as the proton gradient mechanism. The low pH causes the concentration of protons to increase, which drives the proton pump to pump more protons out of the matrix, creating a higher proton gradient. This gradient is then used to generate ATP through the ATP synthase enzyme."
