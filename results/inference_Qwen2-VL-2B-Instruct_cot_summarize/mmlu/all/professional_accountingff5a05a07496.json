This is typically done by a formal agreement or by a court order.\n   - In this case, Stone sold his entire interest to Taylor on April 9.\n\n2. **Status as of January 1:**\n   - On January 1, the partnership's status is determined by the interests of the remaining partners. Since Stone sold his interest, the partnership is terminated as of January 1.\n\n3. **Status as of April 9:**\n   - On April 9, Stone sold his interest to Taylor, which terminated the partnership. However, the partnership continued to exist as a legal entity until April 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement regarding Studio's status as of January 1 and April 9 is:\n\n**A. Studio terminated as of January 1.**\n\nThis is because the partnership was terminated on January 1 due to Stone's sale of his interest to Taylor."
