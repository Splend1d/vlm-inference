The placebo effect is a related concept, but it involves the use of a substance or treatment that is believed to have an effect but does not have any actual effect. The control group effect refers to the comparison of the outcomes of a group that is not exposed to the treatment (control group) with the outcomes of a group that is exposed to the treatment (treatment group). Sampling error is a statistical error that occurs when the sample used to estimate the population is not representative of the population."
