If the contract is divisible, it means that the $10,000 assigned to the bathroom is an equivalent amount for the completed portion of the agreement. This means that if the court finds that the contract is divisible, Charlie will be entitled to the $10,000 as compensation for the completed portion of the work.\n\n2. **Completion of the Bathroom**: Charlie completed the bathroom, which is a completed portion of the agreement. Therefore, the court will likely consider the $10,000 as an equivalent amount for the completed portion of the agreement.\n\n3. **Non-completion of the Kitchen**: Charlie refused to begin the kitchen remodeling because Nancy did not cooperate. This refusal is a breach of the contract, but it does not affect the $10,000 that Charlie is entitled to as compensation for the completed portion of the agreement.\n\nTherefore, the likely outcome is that Charlie will be entitled to $10,000 as compensation for the completed portion of the agreement, making option C the correct answer."
