At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant.\nB. No, because the lease was oral.\nC. Yes, because they were accessions.\nD. Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n"

The tenant's failure to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continuing to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months also indicates that the tenant was not in compliance with the lease terms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant."
