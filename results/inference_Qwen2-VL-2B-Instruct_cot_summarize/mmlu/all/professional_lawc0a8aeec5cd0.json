A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, \"Our lawmakers do not care about our children.\" The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?\n\nA. No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.\nB.

This prohibition is aimed at preserving the appearance and accessibility of the capitol building.\n   - The prohibition is necessary to preserve the appearance and accessibility of the capitol building, which is a public building.\n\n3. **Analysis of the constitutionality:**\n   - The prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\n   - The prohibition is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest.\n\nGiven the analysis, the court should **not** uphold the law's constitutionality.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA.
