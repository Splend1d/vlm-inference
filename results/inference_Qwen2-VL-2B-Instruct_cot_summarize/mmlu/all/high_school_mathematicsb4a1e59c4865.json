This means that if we let $x$ be the surface area of the cube, then the amount of paint, $y$, is given by the equation $y = kx$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nWe are given that David can completely cover a cube of side length 2 feet with exactly 16 quarts of paint. This means that the surface area of the cube is $6 \\times 2^2 = 24$ square feet. So we have $24 = k \\times 16$, which gives us $k = \\frac{24}{16} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nNow we want to find out how big a cube David can cover with 169 quarts of paint. We can use the same equation $y = kx$ to find the surface area of the cube. We know that $x = 169$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $169 = \\frac{4}{3} \\times x$.\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{3}{4}$ to get $x = 169 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 117.75$.\n\nHowever, the surface area of a cube is always an integer, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe know that the surface area of a cube is $6 \\times \\text{side length}^2$. So if we let $x$ be the side length of the cube, then the surface area is $6x^2$. We are given that the surface area is 24, so we have $6x^2 = 24$. Dividing both sides by 6 gives us $x^2 = 4$, and taking the square root of both sides gives us $x = 2$.\n\nSo the side length of the cube is 2 feet. Now we can check our work by finding the surface area of the cube. The surface area is $6 \\times 2^2 = 24$, which matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, David can cover a cube with a side length of 2 feet with 169 quarts of paint. The answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
