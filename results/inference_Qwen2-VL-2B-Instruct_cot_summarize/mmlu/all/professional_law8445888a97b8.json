A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse, in jail clothing, and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter. Will the court allow that identification into evidence?\n\nA. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\nB. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\nD. Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.\n"

The witness identified the defendant based on the appearance of his eyes, which she saw clearly. This identification was made on the basis of the witness's perception of the perpetrator, not on any prior statements or evidence. Therefore, the identification is reliable enough to be admitted into evidence. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted."
