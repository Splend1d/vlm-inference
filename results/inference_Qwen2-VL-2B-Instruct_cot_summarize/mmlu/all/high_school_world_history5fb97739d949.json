It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire?\n\nA.

The quote discusses the impact of barbarian invasions on the Roman Empire, specifically mentioning the Chamavi and Angrivarii who entered Roman settlements and exterminated the Tencteri, a tribe. The quote also mentions the spectacle of the conflict and the loss of more than sixty thousand lives.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Civil wars between rivals for the throne - This is a significant factor in the decline of the Roman Empire, as it weakened the central authority and led to internal strife.\n\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire - This is a direct consequence of the barbarian invasions mentioned in the quote, which contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire.\n\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire - This is a factor that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, as the Senate's power and influence weakened over time.\n\nD. Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics - This is a factor that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, as it weakened the population and weakened the empire's ability to sustain itself.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire is:\n\nD. Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics\n\nFinal answer: D."
