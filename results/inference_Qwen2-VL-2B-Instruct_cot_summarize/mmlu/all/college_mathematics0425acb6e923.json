This is because if \\( P \\) is invertible, then \\( P \\cdot P = P \\cdot P^2 = P^2 \\), which implies \\( P \\cdot P = P \\cdot P^2 = P^2 \\). However, this does not necessarily mean \\( P \\) is the identity transformation, as \\( P \\) could also be the zero transformation.\n\n2. If \\( P \\) is diagonalizable, then \\( P \\) is invertible. This is because a diagonalizable transformation is invertible, and if \\( P \\) is diagonalizable, then \\( P \\) is invertible.\n\n3. If \\( P \\) is the identity transformation, then \\( P \\cdot P = P \\), which implies \\( P^2 = P \\). This is true because the identity transformation is its own inverse.\n\n4.
