An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables.\n- Larger pages generally lead to smaller page tables because they require fewer entries to represent the same amount of data. This is because larger pages can fit more data into the same space, reducing the number of entries needed in the page table.\n\nII. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.\n- Smaller pages generally lead to less internal fragmentation because they can fit more data into the same space, reducing the likelihood of data being scattered across multiple pages. This can lead to better performance and lower fragmentation.\n\nIII. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously.\n- While longer pages can theoretically lead to better performance due to reduced fragmentation, the dominant factor in disk access time is typically the size of the data blocks being accessed, not the page length. Therefore, longer pages may not be advantageous in terms of disk access time.\n\nGiven this analysis, the considerations that apply are:\n\nI. An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables.\nII. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and III only"
