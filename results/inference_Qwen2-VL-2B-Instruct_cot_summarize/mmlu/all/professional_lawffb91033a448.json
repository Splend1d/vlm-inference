                    "text": "The most applicable common law doctrine in this scenario would be:\n\nD. Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs.\n\nThis doctrine is applicable because the homeowner conveyed the property to his cousin \"for life, with remainder to (the homeowner's) heirs.\" This means that the cousin has a life interest in the property, and the homeowner's heirs have a remainder interest. When the cousin dies, the homeowner's heirs can bring suit to quiet title, which is a common law doctrine that deals with the ownership of property when a grantor (in this case, the homeowner) has conveyed property to a grantee (the cousin) with a remainder interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs."
