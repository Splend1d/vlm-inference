The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.\nB. Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.\nC. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\nD. No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the woman will prevail in her lawsuit against the owner of the lumber yard, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Privity of Contract**: The woman is an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard. This means that the woman is not a direct party to the contract between the builder and the lumber yard. Therefore, she cannot be held liable for the builder's breach of contract.\n\n2. **Equitable Assignment**: The woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract. This means that the woman can recover damages from the owner of the lumber yard, even if the builder is not the direct party to the contract.\n\n3. **Discharge of Contract**: The woman cannot prevail if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire. If the fire destroyed the lumber yard's supply of lumber, the builder's contract with the lumber yard would be discharged, and the woman would not have a claim against the owner of the lumber yard.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.**\n\nTherefore, the woman will not prevail in her lawsuit against the owner of the lumber yard."
