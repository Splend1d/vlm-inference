The learning rate is a crucial parameter in training neural networks, as it determines how quickly the network adjusts its weights during training. A higher learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may also cause the network to overshoot the optimal solution, while a lower learning rate can lead to slower convergence but ensures that the network does not get stuck in local minima.\n\nStatement 2: Dropout multiplies randomly chosen activation values by zero.\n- This statement is false. Dropout, also known as dropout regularization, is a technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training. This technique does not multiply randomly chosen activation values by zero; instead, it randomly sets the values of individual units to zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
