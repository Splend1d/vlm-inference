The professor was recently involved in a highly visible political protest against the government. The police eventually shut down the protest because they felt that it was becoming unruly. A television crew covered the entire rally. On the six o'clock news that evening, the film of the protest rally was shown during the broadcast. A news anchorman then made the following commentary: \"It's a shame that public funds are spent to pay the salaries of such university professors, who are not grateful for what this country has done for them. In my opinion, these people like the professor should be deported. \"If the professor asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the television station and the anchorman for his television commentary, the most likely result is that the professor will\n\nA. not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally.\nB. not prevail, because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest.\nC. prevail, because the professor, as a private individual, was placed in a false light.\nD. prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice.\n"

The most likely result is that the professor will not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally. The professor's claim that the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest is also unlikely to succeed, as the broadcast was not a public service or a news program. The professor's claim that the commentary was made with actual malice is also unlikely to succeed, as the commentary was made in a public setting and was not directed at the professor personally. The professor's claim that the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest is also unlikely to succeed, as the broadcast was not a public service or a news program. Therefore, the most likely result is that the professor will not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally. The correct answer is:\n\nA. not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally."
