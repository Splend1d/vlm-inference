The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.**\n   - This is true. At the highest point, the ball is momentarily at rest due to the absence of air resistance. The velocity is zero.\n\n2. **II. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.**\n   - This is also true. At the highest point, the ball is momentarily at rest due to the absence of air resistance. The acceleration is zero.\n\n3. **III. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.**\n   - This is false. The time it takes to travel up to the highest point and then back down is the same. The ball's motion is symmetric about the highest point, so the time to reach the highest point and the time to fall back down are equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I & II only"
