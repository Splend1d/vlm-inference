According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is considered morally wrong because it involves the use of force or control over another person's freedom without their consent. In scenario 2, the main character walked their dog for 20 minutes, which is a legal and ethical activity. Therefore, the main character's action in scenario 2 is not considered morally wrong."
