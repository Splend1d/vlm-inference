The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven:\n- Sample size (n) = 40\n- Population mean (\u03bc) = 4 ounces\n- Population standard deviation (\u03c3) = 0.25 ounces\n- Sample mean (x\u0304) = 3.9 ounces\n\nWe need to find the probability that the sample mean (x\u0304) is less than 3.9 ounces. This is a one-tailed test because we are interested in the probability of the sample mean being less than 3.9 ounces.\n\nThe z-score for a sample mean of 3.9 ounces is calculated as follows:\n\\[ z = \\frac{x\u0304 - \u03bc}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ z = \\frac{3.9 - 4}{0.25 / \\sqrt{40}} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{-0.1}{0.25 / \\sqrt{40}} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{-0.1}{0.25 / 6.326} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{-0.1}{0.039} \\]\n\\[ z \u2248 -2.58 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability that z is less than -2.58. This probability is approximately 0.0057.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 0.0057"
