Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\n\nThe sky appears blue because the atmosphere scatters short wavelengths of light, primarily blue and violet, more than long wavelengths. This scattering effect causes the sky to appear blue, even though the Earth's atmosphere is not blue in color."
