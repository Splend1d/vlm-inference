The ideals of the Russian Revolution were betrayed by the Leninist and Stalinist regimes.**\n     - This proposition suggests a critique of the ideals of the Russian Revolution, which was a key component of the Bolshevik Revolution. The chart does not provide any information about the ideals of the Russian Revolution or the Bolshevik regime's actions.\n   - **B. Lenin and Stalin vastly improved Russian military preparedness.**\n     - The chart does not provide any information about the military preparedness of the Russian military under Lenin and Stalin. Therefore, this proposition cannot be supported by the chart.\n   - **C. Communism has been made to work more efficiently in Russia than in China.**\n     - The chart does not provide any comparative data between Russia and China. Therefore, this proposition cannot be supported by the chart.\n   - **D. Despite abuses on the part of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet regime managed significant achievements.**\n     - The chart provides data on literacy rates, which are a measure of education and literacy. This information suggests that despite the abuses, the Soviet regime managed significant achievements in education and literacy. This proposition is supported by the chart.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate proposition that the historian sympathetic to Soviet communism would most likely use the chart as evidence to support is:\n\n**D. Despite abuses on the part of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet regime managed significant achievements.**"
