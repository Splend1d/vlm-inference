First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the dimensions of the patio are given in feet, we'll convert the brick dimensions to feet. \n\n- 4 inches is equal to \\(4/12 = 1/3\\) feet.\n- 6 inches is equal to \\(6/12 = 1/2\\) feet.\n- 2 inches is equal to \\(2/12 = 1/6\\) feet.\n\nNow, we calculate the volume of one brick in cubic feet:\n\\[ \\text{Volume of one brick} = (1/3) \\times (1/2) \\times (1/6) = 1/36 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total volume of the patio in cubic feet:\n\\[ \\text{Total volume of the patio} = 120 \\times 1/36 = 120/36 = 10/3 \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total volume of the patio by the volume of one brick to find the greatest number of bricks Zoey could sell:\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{10/3}{1/36} = \\frac{10}{3} \\times 36 = 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of bricks Zoey could sell is 120, which corresponds to option C."
