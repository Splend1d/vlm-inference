In Scenario 1, the character did not peek when their sister was showering, which is generally considered a respectful and private act. In Scenario 2, the character said their stomach hurt because they felt sharp pains, which is also generally considered a private and honest response. Therefore, neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
