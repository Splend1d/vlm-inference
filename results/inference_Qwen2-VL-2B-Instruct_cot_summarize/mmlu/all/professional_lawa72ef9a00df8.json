This means the funds are held in trust and are not available for the lady's personal use.\n\n3. **Trustee**: The trust is held by the lady's cousin, who is the trustee.\n\n4. **Trustee's Appointment**: The trust is appointed by the lady's grandchild, who appoints the cousin as the trustee.\n\n5. **Grandchild's Death**: The grandchild dies, and the trust ends.\n\n6. **Debt**: The lady is in debt.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\nA. **Yes, because of the rule in Shelly's case.**\n   - Shelly's case involves a trust that is held by a donee (the person who receives the trust property) and the trust is not revocable. In this case, creditors can attach the property because the trust is not revocable and the donee is not the original owner.\n   - This does not apply here because the trust is held by the lady's cousin, who is the original owner.\n\nB. **No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.**\n   - This is correct. The lady's cousin is the donee, and the trust is not revocable. Therefore, creditors cannot attach the funds.\n\nC. **Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.**\n   - This is incorrect. The will is not invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments. The will is valid as written.\n\nD. **No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.**\n   - This is incorrect. The will as written is valid, and the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct answer is B. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds."
