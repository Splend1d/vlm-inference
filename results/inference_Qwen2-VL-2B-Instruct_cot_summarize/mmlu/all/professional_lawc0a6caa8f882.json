She didn't tell him that she was pregnant, and decided to get an abortion without telling him. Her state had a law requiring her to sign a statement verifying that she had told her husband of her intended abortion. She refused to sign and sued the state to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Is the law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the law did not intrude on the wife's right to privacy because the husband had an equal right to be protected.\nB. No, the law presented only a minimum intrusion and it would not be difficult for married women to obtain their husband's consent.\nC. Yes, it is unconstitutional because a woman has an unqualified right to an abortion on demand.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n"

Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n\nThe law in question is unconstitutional because it imposes a significant burden on the woman's right to obtain an abortion. The law requires her to sign a statement verifying that she informed her husband of her intention to have an abortion, which is a significant burden on her privacy and autonomy. The law's requirement to sign a statement is not necessary for the woman to obtain an abortion and does not provide any additional protection for her rights. Therefore, the law is unconstitutional.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nA. No, the law did not intrude on the wife's right to privacy because the husband had an equal right to be protected.\n- This option is incorrect because the law does indeed intrude on the wife's privacy by requiring her to sign a statement.\n\nB. No, the law presented only a minimum intrusion and it would not be difficult for married women to obtain their husband's consent.\n- This option is incorrect because the law does not present a minimum intrusion; it imposes a significant burden on the woman's privacy and autonomy.\n\nC. Yes, it is unconstitutional because a woman has an unqualified right to an abortion on demand.\n- This option is incorrect because the law does not grant a woman an unqualified right to an abortion on demand; it imposes a significant burden on her privacy and autonomy.\n\nTherefore, the only option that accurately describes the law's constitutionality is:\n\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion."
