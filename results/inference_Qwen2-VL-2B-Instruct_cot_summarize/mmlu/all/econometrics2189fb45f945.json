(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nWhen OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is used in the presence of autocorrelation, several consequences can occur:\n\ni) Coefficient estimates may be misleading: Autocorrelation can lead to biased coefficient estimates, as the sample mean is not an unbiased estimator of the population mean.\n\nii) Hypothesis tests could reach the wrong conclusions: The standard errors of the coefficients are also affected by autocorrelation, which can lead to incorrect hypothesis testing.\n\niii) Forecasts made from the model could be biased: The model's predictions may not be accurate due to the biased coefficients.\n\niv) Standard errors may be inappropriate: The standard errors of the coefficients are also affected by autocorrelation, which can lead to incorrect standard errors.\n\nTherefore, all of these consequences are likely to occur when OLS is used in the presence of autocorrelation."
