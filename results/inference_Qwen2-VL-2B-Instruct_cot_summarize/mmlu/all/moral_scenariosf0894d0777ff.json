This action is considered morally wrong because it caused harm to the baby, which is a violation of the principle of treating others with respect and care.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) helped an old lady across the road. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a positive act of kindness and assistance to another person. Helping others is generally considered a positive moral behavior."
