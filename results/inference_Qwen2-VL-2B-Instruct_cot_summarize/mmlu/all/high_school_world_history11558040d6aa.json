By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation\nC. That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change\n"

                    "text": "This question is a multiple-choice problem that requires us to identify the traditional view of world history that the passage challenges. The passage discusses the technological advancements in Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s, with a focus on the effectiveness of early cannons in Europe and the limitations of early gunpowder weapons in China.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies\n- This option suggests a comparison between China and other Afro-Eurasian societies. The passage does not make a direct comparison between China and other societies, so this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation\n- The passage does not discuss China's form of dictatorial rule. It focuses on the effectiveness of early cannons and gunpowder weapons in Europe and China, respectively.\n\nC. That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts\n- The passage does not mention religious fundamentalism as a hindrance to modernizing efforts. It focuses on the effectiveness of early cannons and gunpowder weapons in Europe and China, respectively.\n\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change\n- This option suggests that China turned a blind eye to the benefits of technological change, which is a direct challenge to the passage. The passage highlights the effectiveness of early cannons and gunpowder weapons in Europe, while China's limitations are discussed.\n\nTherefore, the traditional view of world history that this passage seems to challenge is:\n\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change."
