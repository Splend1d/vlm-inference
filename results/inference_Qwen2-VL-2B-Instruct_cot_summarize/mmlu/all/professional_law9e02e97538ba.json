The purpose of these rules is to assist the agency in attaining the clean water standards required by the statute. After the agency issued such rules, several states filed an action challenging the rules on the sole ground that they are unconstitutional. Should the court uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules?\n\nA. No, because the federal government may not compel a state legislature to enact into state law a federally mandated regulatory program.\nB. No, because the Tenth Amendment grants states immunity from all direct federal states immunity from all direct federal regulation.\nC. Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\nD. Yes, because the supremacy clause of Article VI requires states to enforce federal law.\n"

                    "text": "The question involves a legal analysis of whether a federal statute and its accompanying rules can be upheld in the context of state sovereignty and constitutional principles.\n\n1. **Federalism and State Sovereignty**: The federal government has the authority to regulate certain areas, but it cannot compel states to adopt specific laws. The Tenth Amendment explicitly grants states immunity from federal regulation in areas not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. This principle is known as \"state sovereignty.\"\n\n2. **Supremacy Clause**: The supremacy clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution states that \"the laws of the United States are the supreme law of the land.\" This clause implies that federal laws take precedence over state laws, but it does not directly address the constitutionality of federal regulations.\n\n3. **Purpose and Duration**: The purpose of the federal rules is to assist the agency in achieving the clean water standards required by the statute. The rules are temporary and do not impose a permanent regulatory burden on the states. The requirement that the states adopt laws of limited duration is a reasonable and necessary measure to comply with the federal mandate.\n\nGiven these points, the court should uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules. The rules serve an important purpose and are necessary to achieve the statutory goals. The requirement that the states adopt laws of limited duration is a reasonable and necessary measure to comply with the federal mandate.\n\n**Final Answer: C. Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.**"
