This action is generally considered to be a positive and supportive behavior, as it shows enthusiasm and support for the team. In scenario 2, the main character decided to dash and dine at the diner. This action is generally considered to be a positive and enjoyable activity, as it allows the character to relax and enjoy themselves. Therefore, neither of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
