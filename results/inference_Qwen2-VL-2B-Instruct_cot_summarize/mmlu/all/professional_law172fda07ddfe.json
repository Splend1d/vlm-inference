The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.\nB. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.\nC. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\nD. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.\n"

The boyfriend then brought a defamation action against the telephone operator and the telephone company for slander. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.**\n   - This option suggests that the telephone operator's identification was so wrong that it could be considered slander per se, which is a type of defamation where the identity of the person is falsely attributed to the speaker. However, the scenario does not explicitly state that the identification was so wrong that it could be considered slander per se. The identification was made without actual malice, which is a key factor in slander law.\n\nB. **Succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.**\n   - This option suggests that the loss of the boyfriend's good reputation in the community was the basis for the defamation. However, the scenario does not mention any loss of reputation or community reaction.\n\nC. **Not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.**\n   - This option suggests that the identification was made without actual malice, which is a defense in defamation law. However, the scenario does not provide any indication that the identification was made without actual malice.\n\nD. **Not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.**\n   - This option suggests that the identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest. However, the scenario does not provide any information about the telephone operator's identification being made in the public interest.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.**\n\nThe telephone operator's identification was made without actual malice, which is a defense in defamation law."
