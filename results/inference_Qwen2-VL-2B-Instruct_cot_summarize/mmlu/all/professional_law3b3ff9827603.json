After first stating all of his qualifications at the non-jury trial, the pathologist testified that he and his associates made five separate blood grouping tests and that all proper safeguards were taken to protect the integrity and accuracy of the tests. The pathologist also offered more detailed testimony about the testing procedures and stated that no discrepancies were found in the testing methods. Finally, the pathologist made the statement that the blood grouping tests were conclusive in proving that the defendant could not be the father of the child. If the complainant's attorney makes an objection to the introduction of the blood tests into evidence, the court will most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the blood tests are not conclusive evidence of paternity.\nB. sustain the objection, because blood tests have not been generally recognized by the scientific community.\nC. overrule the objection, because the court will take judicial notice of the accuracy of such tests.\nD. overrule the objection, because the blood tests are an admission.\n"

The reason is that the blood tests are not conclusive evidence of paternity. Blood grouping tests are generally used to determine the genetic relationship between individuals, but they do not provide definitive proof of paternity. The pathologist's testimony that all proper safeguards were taken to protect the integrity and accuracy of the tests and that no discrepancies were found in the testing methods is not sufficient to establish the defendant's paternity. The blood tests are not conclusive evidence of paternity, and the complainant's attorney's objection is valid. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the blood tests are not conclusive evidence of paternity."
