The landlord has the right to collect rent from the tenant, and the tenant has the right to receive rent from the landlord. The landlord cannot collect rent from the tenant without the tenant's consent, and the tenant cannot collect rent from the landlord without the landlord's consent.\n\n2. **Privity of Contract**: This principle exists between a landlord and a sublessee who has a sublease agreement. The landlord has the right to collect rent from the sublessee, and the sublessee has the right to receive rent from the landlord. The landlord cannot collect rent from the sublessee without the sublessee's consent, and the sublessee cannot collect rent from the landlord without the landlord's consent.\n\nIn this case, the cousin is a sublessee who has a sublease agreement with the landlord. The landlord cannot collect rent from the cousin without the cousin's consent, and the cousin cannot collect rent from the landlord without the landlord's consent. Therefore, the landlord does not have privity of estate between the landlord and the cousin.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee."
