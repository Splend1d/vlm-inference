(which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, \"Look at that car upside down. \" The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will\n\nA. recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.\nB. recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\nC. recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\nD. recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.\n"
