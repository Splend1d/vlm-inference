Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.**\n   - This is true. In IPv4, datagrams are typically sent as a single packet, and the size of the smallest MTU is used to determine the size of the datagram. If the smallest MTU is not the same as the size of the datagram, the datagram will be fragmented during routing.\n\n2. **II. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.**\n   - This is true. In IPv4, datagrams are typically sent as a single packet, but they can be fragmented during routing if necessary to fit through the network.\n\n3. **III. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.**\n   - This is false. In IPv4, datagrams are typically sent as a single packet, and they are not reassembled at the destination. They are typically delivered as a single packet to the destination.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. II only"
