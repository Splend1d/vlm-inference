The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\n\nThis statement is correct because human tissue proteins are assumed to be the primary source of amino acids for infants and young children, as they are the most rapidly growing tissues in the body. The amino acid requirements for adults are assumed to be the maintenance requirements, which are different from the growth requirements for infants and young children."
