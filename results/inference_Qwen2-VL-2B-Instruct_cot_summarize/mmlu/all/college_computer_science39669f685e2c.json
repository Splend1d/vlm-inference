Counting distinct values: Given a set of n keys, determine the number of distinct key values.\n- This problem can be solved using a hash table because it involves counting the number of distinct elements in a set, which can be efficiently done by iterating through the set and checking for uniqueness.\n\nB. Dynamic dictionary: Support the operations of insert, delete, and search in a dictionary.\n- This problem can also be solved using a hash table because it involves maintaining a dictionary where each key-value pair is stored in a hash table, which allows for efficient insert, delete, and search operations.\n\nC. Range search: Given values a and b, find all the records whose key value is in the range a, b.\n- This problem can be solved using a hash table because it involves searching for records whose key value falls within a specified range, which can be efficiently done by iterating through the hash table and checking the key value against the range.\n\nD. Symbol table lookup: Given a program identifier, find its type and address.\n- This problem can be solved using a hash table because it involves looking up a specific value in a table, which can be efficiently done by using a hash function to map the key to the appropriate location in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem that does not benefit from using a hash table for an efficient average-case solution is:\n\nC. Range search: Given values a and b, find all the records whose key value is in the range a, b."
