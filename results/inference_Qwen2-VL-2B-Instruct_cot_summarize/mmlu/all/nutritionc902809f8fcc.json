Iron deficiency can lead to changes in these markers, and infection can also alter these markers. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Low haemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin\n- Low haemoglobin and high ferritin are typical of iron deficiency. High serum transferrin receptors and high hepcidin are also commonly seen in iron deficiency. However, high ferritin can also be seen in other conditions, so this combination is not specific to iron deficiency.\n\nB. Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin\n- Low haemoglobin and low ferritin are typical of iron deficiency. High serum transferrin receptors and low hepcidin are also commonly seen in iron deficiency. This combination is specific to iron deficiency.\n\nC. Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin\n- Low haemoglobin and low ferritin are typical of iron deficiency. Normal serum transferrin receptors and high hepcidin are also commonly seen in iron deficiency. This combination is not specific to iron deficiency.\n\nD. Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, low serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin\n- Low haemoglobin and low ferritin are typical of iron deficiency. Low serum transferrin receptors and high hepcidin are also commonly seen in iron deficiency. This combination is not specific to iron deficiency.\n\nGiven the analysis, the combination that is likely to be found in a person with both iron deficiency and a severe infection is:\n\nB. Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
