She does not recall any sick contacts. She had chickenpox at the age of 7 years. Her most recent examination 1 year ago included PPD skin testing and showed no abnormalities. She takes a daily multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She received all appropriate immunizations during childhood but has not received any since then. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse petechiae. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Ceftriaxone\nB. Clindamycin\nC. Erythromycin\nD. Metronidazole\n"

Erythromycin\n\nErythromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacteria, including the type seen in the CSF analysis. It is also commonly used for prophylaxis against certain sexually transmitted infections and is not associated with the adverse effects seen with other antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone or clindamycin. Metronidazole is not indicated for this condition, and clindamycin is not effective against gram-negative bacteria. Ceftriaxone is not indicated for this condition either, as it is not effective against gram-negative bacteria."
