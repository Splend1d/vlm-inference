                    "text": "To determine the position of stable equilibrium, we need to find the points where the potential energy function U(x) = (x \u2013 2)3 \u2013 12x is zero. This is because at equilibrium, the net force acting on the particle is zero, and the potential energy is at a minimum.\n\nSetting U(x) = 0, we have:\n\n(x \u2013 2)3 \u2013 12x = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 2 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots analytically can be complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots. Let's use a numerical method like the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator to find the roots.\n\nUpon numerical evaluation, we find that the roots are approximately x \u2248 2.3 and x \u2248 0.3. Since we are looking for a stable equilibrium, we are interested in the root that represents a stable position.\n\nThe root x \u2248 0.3 corresponds to a stable equilibrium because it is a positive root, indicating that the particle will move away from this position when the force is applied. The root x \u2248 2.3 is a negative root, indicating that the particle will move towards this position when the force is applied.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. x = 0"
