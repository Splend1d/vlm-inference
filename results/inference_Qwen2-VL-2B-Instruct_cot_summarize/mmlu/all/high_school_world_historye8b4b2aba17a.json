The quote describes a person who is filled with all the works, desires, perfumes, and tastes of the universe. This person is described as loving all and encompassing the universe in silence. The speaker mentions that this person will come to them when they go beyond this life and that the person who has faith and doubts not will come to them.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Salvation is based on the correct completion of rituals.\n- This option suggests that salvation is achieved through specific rituals or practices. The quote does not mention any specific rituals or practices that are required for salvation. It focuses more on the inner state of the speaker and the expectation of a future life.\n\nB. There is an expectation of an afterlife.\n- This option aligns with the idea that the speaker expects a future life after death. The quote mentions that the speaker will come to the person who has faith and doubts not, implying that this person will be in a state of belief and faith.\n\nC. Right actions and right speech earn favor with the gods.\n- This option suggests that the speaker believes that good actions and speech will bring favor from the gods. The quote does not mention anything about good actions or speech, so this option is not supported by the text.\n\nD. It is a polytheistic religion.\n- This option suggests that the religion is polytheistic, meaning it has multiple gods. The quote does not provide any information about the number of gods or the nature of their relationship with the speaker. Therefore, this option cannot be confirmed based on the given text.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the statement that is true of the speaker's religion is:\n\nB. There is an expectation of an afterlife."
