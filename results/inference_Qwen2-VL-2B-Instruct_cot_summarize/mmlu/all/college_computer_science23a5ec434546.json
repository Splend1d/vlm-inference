                    "text": "To determine which representation will result in overflow when adding the integers 011000 and 011000, we need to consider the rules for two's complement, one's complement, and sign and magnitude representations.\n\n1. **Two's complement**: This representation uses the two's complement system, where the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. If the MSB is 1, the number is negative; if it is 0, the number is positive. The other bits represent the magnitude of the number.\n\n2. **One's complement**: This representation uses the one's complement system, where the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. If the MSB is 1, the number is negative; if it is 0, the number is positive. The other bits represent the magnitude of the number.\n\n3. **Sign and magnitude**: This representation uses the sign bit to indicate whether the number is positive or negative, and the magnitude bits represent the magnitude of the number.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis**:\n\n- **Two's complement**: The two's complement representation of 011000 is -11111111 (in binary). Adding 011000 to -11111111 results in 10000000, which is 10 in decimal. This is a positive number, so there is no overflow.\n\n- **One's complement**: The one's complement representation of 011000 is 10000000 (in binary). Adding 011000 to 10000000 results in 11000000, which is 11 in decimal. This is also a positive number, so there is no overflow.\n\n- **Sign and magnitude**: The sign and magnitude representation of 011000 is 011000. Adding 011000 to 011000 results in 11100000, which is 11 in decimal. This is a positive number, so there is no overflow.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe correct answer is **A. Two's complement only**."
