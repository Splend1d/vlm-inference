All of the options given are correct.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- **Option A**: \"In the embryonic period, the foetus is vulnerable to external factors in its environment.\"\n  - This is true. During the embryonic period, the foetus is still very vulnerable to external factors such as environmental pollution, exposure to toxins, and infections. This is because the foetus is still developing and has not yet fully formed.\n\n- **Option B**: \"The embryonic period often occurs before a woman knows she is pregnant.\"\n  - This is true. The embryonic period typically occurs before a woman knows she is pregnant, as the foetus is still in the uterus and not yet visible outside the womb.\n\n- **Option C**: \"Interventions in late pregnancy may be too late to be effective.\"\n  - This is true. Interventions in late pregnancy, such as prenatal care or nutrition, are often too late to be effective because the foetus has already begun to develop and is no longer vulnerable to external factors.\n\nTherefore, all of the options given are true."
