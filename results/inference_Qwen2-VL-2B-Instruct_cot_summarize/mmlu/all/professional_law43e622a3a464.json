On May 1, the collector sent the following letter to a retailer who had long coveted the collector's coin collection:\"I've decided to part with my coin collection. Since you've always been interested in purchasing my collection for your store, I'll sell you my entire collection for $50,000. You have until May 15 to make up your mind. \"The retailer received this letter on May 3. On May 10, without notif'ing the retailer, the collector sold her coin collection to a novice collector, for $60,000. The next day, the collector sent a letter to the retailer, regretfully informing him that she had sold the coin collection. This letter was received by the retailer on May 13. However, on May 12, the retailer read an article on the internet, published by a reputable site that reports coin collecting news, concerning the collector's sale of her coin collection to the novice collector. After reading the article, the retailer immediately sent an e-mail to the collector accepting her offer to buy the coin collection. This e-mail was read by the collector that same afternoon, May 12. In all likelihood was the retailer's e-mail to the collector on May 12 effective as an acceptance?\n\nA. Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation, since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.\nB. Yes, because consideration is not necessary under the UCC for the creation of a sale of goods contract.\nC. No, because the collector's sale of the coin collection on May 10 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\nD. No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n"

Therefore, the retailer cannot revoke the offer based on the collector's letter.\n\n- **May 12: Retailer's e-mail is effective as an acceptance.**\n  - The retailer's e-mail is sent on May 12, and it is read by the collector on the same day. This e-mail is an acceptance of the retailer's offer to buy the coin collection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe retailer's e-mail on May 12 was effective as an acceptance because the retailer's acceptance was communicated to the collector on the same day the retailer read the article on the internet, which occurred on May 12. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.**"
