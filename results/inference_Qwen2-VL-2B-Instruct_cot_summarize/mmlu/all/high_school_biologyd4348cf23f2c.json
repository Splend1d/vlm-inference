                    "text": "To determine the expected characteristics of kangaroo-rat kidneys compared to human kidneys, we need to consider the structure and function of the kidneys in both species.\n\nKangaroo rats have a specialized kidney structure that allows them to concentrate urine more effectively. This is achieved through the following key features:\n\n1. **Nephrons**: Kangaroo rats have a higher number of nephrons compared to humans. This is because they have a higher water intake and need to concentrate their urine more efficiently.\n\n2. **Nephron Structure**: Kangaroo rats have a unique structure where each nephron has a longer loop of Henle compared to humans. This loop of Henle is responsible for the concentration of urine.\n\n3. **Collecting Duct**: Kangaroo rats have a shorter collecting duct compared to humans. The collecting duct is responsible for transporting the concentrated urine from the nephrons to the bladder.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the expected differences in the structure of kangaroo-rat kidneys compared to human kidneys are:\n\n- **Thicker walls**: The thicker walls of the collecting ducts in kangaroo rats are not directly related to the concentration of urine but rather to the transport of urine from the nephrons to the bladder.\n- **Shorter loops of Henle**: The longer loops of Henle in kangaroo rats are responsible for the concentration of urine, not the transport of urine.\n- **Shorter collecting ducts**: The shorter collecting ducts in kangaroo rats are responsible for the transport of concentrated urine from the nephrons to the bladder, not the concentration of urine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. shorter collecting ducts"
