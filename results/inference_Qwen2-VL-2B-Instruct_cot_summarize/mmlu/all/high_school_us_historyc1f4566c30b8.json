But we do not have the right to resort to violence\u2014or the threat of violence\u2014when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton, \"What We Learned in Oklahoma City,\" 2010\n(Written on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing)\n\"If there would not have been a Waco, I would have put down roots somewhere and not been so unsettled with the fact that my government\u2026was a threat to me. Everything that Waco implies was on the forefront of my thoughts. That sort of guided my path for the next couple of years.\"\nTimothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City bomber, 2001\nU.S. Representative John Conyers, Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas: Hearing Before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 1993\nThe above excerpts most closely support which of the following inferences?\n\nA.

In the 1990s, anti-government sentiment, in response to excessive uses of federal power to resolve domestic conflicts, inspired militia groups and lone vigilantes, such as Timothy McVeigh.\n- This option suggests that the Oklahoma City bombing was influenced by anti-government sentiment. However, the excerpts do not explicitly mention any specific group or individual as the primary inspiration for the Oklahoma City bombing. The focus is more on the broader context of government power and the consequences of excessive use of federal power.\n\nB.

The excerpts do not provide information about the specific heavy-handed approach taken by Janet Reno.\n\nC. Fearing a rise in anti-government sentiment after the Oklahoma City bombing, Attorney General Janet Reno sent troops to quell the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff, and later faced congressional criticism.\n- This option suggests that Attorney General Janet Reno's actions were influenced by the Oklahoma City bombing. The excerpts do not provide information about the specific actions taken by Janet Reno after the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nD. Attorney General Janet Reno resigned from office in part due to Congressional pressure put on President Clinton by Representative John Conyers.\n- This option suggests that Janet Reno's resignation was influenced by Congressional pressure.

Fearing a rise in anti-government sentiment after the Oklahoma City bombing, Attorney General Janet Reno sent troops to quell the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff, and later faced congressional criticism.\n\nFinal answer: C"
