It dispensed with the idea of containment\n\nThe NSC 68, also known as the National Security Council 68, was a series of meetings held in 1961 by the US National Security Council (NSC) to discuss the Cold War and the potential for a nuclear war. The NSC 68 was seen as a turning point in US Cold War foreign policy because it dispensed with the idea of containment, which had been a central tenet of US foreign policy since the end of World War II. Instead, the NSC 68 emphasized the need for a more flexible and flexible approach to foreign policy, one that would allow the United States to engage with the Soviet Union and other countries without the fear of a nuclear war."
