According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is considered morally wrong because it promotes a dangerous and potentially harmful behavior. Licking cacti can lead to severe skin irritation or even infections.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is vacuuming their car after their interactions at home. This action is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Vacuuming a car is generally considered a necessary and legal activity, and it does not involve any harmful or morally reprehensible behavior."
