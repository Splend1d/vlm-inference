The sensitivity of the test is about the proportion of men with prostate cancer who actually have it, not the prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population.\n\nB. **Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen**: This information is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of the test. It tells us how many men with prostate cancer actually have a test result greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen.\n\nC. **Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population**: This information is not necessary to calculate the sensitivity of the test. The prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population does not affect the sensitivity of the test.\n\nD. **Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL**: This information is not necessary to calculate the sensitivity of the test. The sensitivity of the test is about the proportion of men with prostate cancer who actually have it, not the number of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen"
