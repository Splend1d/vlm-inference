Goodwin v UK (2002)\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has applied the 'living instrument principle' in several cases, but Goodwin v UK (2002) is the most relevant example of this principle in the context of the ECtHR's jurisprudence. In this case, the ECtHR held that the UK's criminal law was not sufficiently comprehensive to cover all forms of sexual harassment, which was a violation of the right to a fair trial. This decision was based on the principle that the law must be flexible enough to accommodate the evolving nature of human rights and the changing circumstances of individuals."
