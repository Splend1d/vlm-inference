The court should consider the negligence law of both State A and State B and apply the law that the court believes most appropriately governs negligence in this action.\n\nIn federal diversity actions, the court must apply the law of the state where the case is filed, which is the state where the plaintiff resides or where the defendant is located. In this case, the truck driver is from State A and the bus driver is from State B. Therefore, the court should apply the negligence law of State A, the truck driver's state of citizenship, to determine the appropriate law for this federal diversity action."
