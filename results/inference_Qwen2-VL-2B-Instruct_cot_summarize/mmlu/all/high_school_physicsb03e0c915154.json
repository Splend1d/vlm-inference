A high voltage battery with resistors arranged in series\n\nWhen resistors are arranged in series, the current is divided among the resistors, and the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances. Therefore, the current through each resistor is less than the current through a single resistor. This means that the total current through the circuit will be less than the current through a single resistor. \n\nOn the other hand, when resistors are arranged in parallel, the current is distributed evenly among the resistors, and the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances divided by the number of resistors. Therefore, the current through each resistor is greater than the current through a single resistor. This means that the total current through the circuit will be greater than the current through a single resistor.\n\nGiven the options, the configuration that will create a circuit with the greatest current is:\n\nA.
