Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents at a store. How is the amount of money Leslie spent written as a fraction?\n- The denominator is 8, representing the total amount of money spent.\n- The numerator is 20, representing the amount of money spent.\n\nSo, the fraction 20/8 represents the amount of money Leslie spent.\n\nB. Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?\n- The denominator is 8, representing the total number of crackers.\n- The numerator is 20, representing the total number of crackers.\n\nSo, the fraction 20/8 represents the number of crackers each grandchild gets.\n\nC. Mitch bought 20 containers of flowers at a plant store. Each container had 8 flowers in it. How many flowers did Mitch buy?\n- The denominator is 8, representing the number of flowers in each container.\n- The numerator is 20, representing the total number of containers.\n\nSo, the fraction 20/8 represents the total number of flowers Mitch bought.\n\nD. Stamps are sold in booklets of 20 stamps. Donna used 8 stamps to send invitations for a party. How many booklets of stamps did Donna use to send her invitations?\n- The denominator is 20, representing the number of stamps in each booklet.\n- The numerator is 8, representing the number of stamps Donna used.\n\nSo, the fraction 8/20 represents the number of booklets of stamps Donna used.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 20/8 can be represented by the situation in option A. Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents at a store."
