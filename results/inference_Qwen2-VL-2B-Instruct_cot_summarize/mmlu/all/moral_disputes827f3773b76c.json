Thomson's conclusion is that the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person. \n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. The abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\n- This option aligns with Thomson's conclusion. If Thomson's conclusion is correct, then the abortion issue cannot be settled by determining at what stage the fetus is a person.\n\nB. Abortion is always morally permissible.\n- Thomson's conclusion does not address the morality of abortion. It only discusses the legal and moral status of the fetus.\n\nC. Abortion is never morally permissible.\n- Thomson's conclusion does not provide information about the moral status of abortion. It only discusses the legal status.\n\nD. The abortion issue can be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\n- Thomson's conclusion does not address the possibility of settling the abortion issue by determining the stage of the fetus. It only discusses the impossibility of settling the issue by that means.\n\nGiven Thomson's conclusion, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person."
