This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves smoking in a public place, which is generally considered to be against the law and can lead to legal consequences. In scenario 2, the main character ran away from their family because their life was horrible. This action is not necessarily morally wrong, as it may be seen as a response to a difficult situation rather than a deliberate act of wrongdoing."
