All of the above.\n\nMetz's view on punishment suggests that the type of punishment that is justified for wrongdoers depends on the nature of the wrongdoing and the harm it caused. He argues that harmful punishment that is proportionate to the harm done by the wrongdoing is justified. Additionally, he suggests that punishment should be unfriendly action that is proportionate to the unfriendly wrongdoing, aimed at correcting the wrongdoing. Finally, he also suggests that punishment should be degradation proportionate to the degrading impacts of the wrongdoing. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
