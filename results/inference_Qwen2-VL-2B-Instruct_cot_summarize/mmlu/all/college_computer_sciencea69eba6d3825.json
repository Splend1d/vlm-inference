In this context, each entry in the hash table is a Boolean variable initialized to false. This means that initially, every word in the dictionary is considered to be in the dictionary.\n\n2. **Hash Function**: The hash function is applied to each word in the dictionary. This function maps the word to a unique index in the hash table. The index is used to set the corresponding Boolean variable in the hash table to true.\n\n3. **Checking Spell**: To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document. If the hash function returns a true value for a word, it means that the word was found in the dictionary. If the hash function returns a false value, it means that the word was not found in the dictionary.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option I**: \"true means the word was in the dictionary.\"\n  - This is correct. If the hash function returns true for a word, it means that the word was found in the dictionary.\n\n- **Option II**: \"false means the word was not in the dictionary.\"\n  - This is also correct. If the hash function returns false for a word, it means that the word was not found in the dictionary.\n\n- **Option III**: \"Hash table size should increase with document size.\"\n  - This is not necessarily correct. The size of the hash table is not directly related to the size of the document. The size of the hash table is determined by the size of the dictionary and the size of the document. The hash function is applied to each word in the document, and the size of the hash table is determined by the number of words in the dictionary and the size of the document.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and II only"
