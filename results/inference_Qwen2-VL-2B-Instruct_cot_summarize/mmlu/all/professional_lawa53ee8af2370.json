She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by \"smoking weed\" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n"

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Joint Enterprise**: The passenger was in the passenger seat and was smoking marijuana, which was blowing out the open window. This suggests that she was actively participating in the joint enterprise of the vehicle operation. The passenger's smoking activity was a part of the operation and contributed to the accident.\n\n2. **Negligence**: The passenger's smoking activity was a significant factor in causing the accident. The driver fell asleep, which was a result of the passenger's smoking activity. The passenger's smoking was not just a passive act but a contributing factor to the accident.\n\n3. **Liability**: The passenger's smoking activity was not per se negligent. It was a contributory factor that caused the accident. The court would likely find that the passenger was not liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances, as the passenger's smoking was not the sole cause of the accident.\n\nTherefore, the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim is likely to be granted because the passenger was actively participating in the joint enterprise and her smoking activity was a significant factor in causing the accident."
