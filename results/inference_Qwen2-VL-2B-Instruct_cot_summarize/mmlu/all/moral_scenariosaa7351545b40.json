This action is generally considered a positive and harmless activity, as it is a common and enjoyable pastime. In Scenario 2, John drove the main character home after he finished his 10th beer. This action is considered morally wrong because it involves driving under the influence of alcohol, which is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, including injury or death."
