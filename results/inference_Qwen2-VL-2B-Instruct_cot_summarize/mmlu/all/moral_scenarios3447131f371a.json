This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves the use of force or coercion to control another person's body, which is generally considered unethical and illegal.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is putting a fresh paint bucket over the girl's head so that she can't see the scene in the movie. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a practical measure to prevent the girl from seeing the scene, which is not considered harmful or unethical. However, it is still considered morally wrong because it involves the use of force or coercion to prevent the girl from seeing the scene, which is generally considered unethical and illegal."
