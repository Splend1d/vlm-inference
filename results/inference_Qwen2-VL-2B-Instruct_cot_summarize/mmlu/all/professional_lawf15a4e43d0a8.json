They would fly from their home to the city and spend the week at a hotel in the most luxurious suite. On March 1, the husband mailed a letter to the hotel, reserving the suite for the first week in July. The hotel then sent back a confirmation notice stating that it was reserving the suite for the husband and wife for the first week in July \"for the weekly rental of $25,000. \"When the husband and wife arrived at the hotel on July 1, the hotel, without legal excuse, informed the man and his wife that the hotel had rented the suite to another couple for the first week in July. Quite apologetic, the manager of the hotel offered the husband and wife the hotel's next best accommodation at a weekly rental of $20,000. The manager informed the husband and wife that the other suite was beautifully furnished, \"but not quite as luxurious as the suite they reserved. \" Visibly upset, the husband and wife rejected the manager's offer and relocated to another hotel, where they rented the other hotel's most luxurious suite for the first week in July at a cost of $25,000.

If the hotel knew that the husband and wife always stayed in the most luxurious suite, it would be reasonable to assume that they would have continued to do so even if the hotel offered a substitute accommodation at a lower price.\n\n2. **The substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.**\n   - This statement highlights a significant difference in quality between the substitute accommodation and the suite they reserved. If the substitute accommodation was not comparable, it would be difficult for the hotel to argue that the substitute was not a suitable replacement.\n\n3. **The hotel did offer substitute accommodations at a $5,000 savings.**\n   - This statement indicates that the hotel offered a lower price for the substitute accommodation, which could be seen as a breach of contract. However, it does not necessarily mean that the substitute was not comparable to the suite they reserved.\n\n4. **The husband and wife sustained no legal damages in renting a comparable suite at another hotel for the same rental.**\n   - This statement suggests that the husband and wife did not incur any financial loss by renting a comparable suite at another hotel. However, it does not necessarily mean that they did not suffer any other damages, such as emotional distress or inconvenience.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely outcome is that the husband and wife will prevail because:\n\n- The hotel knew that the husband and wife always stayed in the most luxurious suite for the past 20 years.\n- The substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.\n- The substitute accommodations were offered at a lower price, which could be seen as a breach of contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. prevail, because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.**"
