This action is generally considered morally wrong because it could have caused harm to the pedestrian, who is not a driver or pedestrian in the same way as a pedestrian is. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) ran to tell their superior after quickly putting a band aid over a small hole in the military submarine interior. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a necessary action to prevent further damage to the submarine and ensure the safety of the crew."
