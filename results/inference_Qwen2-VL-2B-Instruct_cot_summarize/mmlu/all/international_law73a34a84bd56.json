The courts exercise discretion as to the enforcement of foreign judgments on the basis of the rule of comity.\n\nThe rule of comity is a principle that allows courts to enforce foreign judgments based on the principle of fairness and justice, rather than the strict adherence to the rules of the treaty or the doctrine of incorporation or transformation. This principle is based on the idea that courts should consider the interests of the parties involved and the overall balance of justice when determining whether to enforce a foreign judgment."
