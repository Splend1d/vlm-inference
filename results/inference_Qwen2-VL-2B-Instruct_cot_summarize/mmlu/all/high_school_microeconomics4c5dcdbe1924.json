She decides to spend one more hour studying.\n3. We need to determine the relationship between the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of the fourth hour.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is certainly less than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The marginal benefit of the fourth hour could be greater than the marginal cost, depending on the context and the specific circumstances of the student's study habits.\n\nB. The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour.\n   - This statement is also not necessarily true. The marginal benefit of the fourth hour could be less than the marginal cost, depending on the context and the specific circumstances of the student's study habits.\n\nC. Without knowing the student\u2019s opportunity cost of studying, we have no way of knowing whether or not her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs.\n   - This statement is true. The opportunity cost of studying is the value of the next best alternative that the student could have chosen to do instead of studying. Without knowing the student's opportunity cost, we cannot determine whether her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs.\n\nD. The marginal cost of the third hour was likely greater than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The marginal cost of the third hour could be less than the marginal cost of the fourth hour, depending on the context and the specific circumstances of the student's study habits.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most likely true statement is:\n\nC. Without knowing the student\u2019s opportunity cost of studying, we have no way of knowing whether or not her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs.\n\nFinal answer: C."
