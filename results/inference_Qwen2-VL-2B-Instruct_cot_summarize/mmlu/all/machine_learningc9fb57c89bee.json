This is known as the \"boosting\" technique.\n\nStatement 2 is False, as cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model, but it does not directly help in selecting the number of iterations in boosting. The number of iterations in boosting is typically determined by the user or by the specific problem at hand, and cross-validation is not a method for selecting the number of iterations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
