According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each cancer patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute?\n\nA. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary power over the allocation of their public funds.\nB. Public subsidies in hospitals are privileges rather than rights and, therefore, are not entitlements protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\nD. The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.\n"

However, it does not directly address the constitutionality of the specific statute in question. It is more about the general power of the states to allocate funds rather than the specific statute.\n\n2. **Option B: Public subsidies in hospitals are privileges rather than rights and, therefore, are not entitlements protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n   - This option argues that the subsidies are not entitlements protected by the due process clause. However, it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute in question. It is more about the nature of the subsidies rather than their constitutionality.\n\n3. **Option C: The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.**\n   - This option suggests that the funding limitation is not directly related to a fundamental right and is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. This option directly addresses the constitutionality of the statute by arguing that it does not directly interfere with a fundamental right and is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n\n4. **Option D: The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.**\n   - This option suggests that the statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry. However, it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute in question. It is more about the purpose of the statute rather than its constitutionality.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, **Option C** is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute. It directly addresses the constitutionality of the statute by arguing that it does not directly interfere with a fundamental right and is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n\n**Final Answer: C. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.**"
