All tissue proteins undergo catabolism at more or less the same rate.\n\nProteolysis, or the breakdown of proteins, is a complex process that occurs in various tissues and organs throughout the body. The rate of tissue protein catabolism is generally more or less constant throughout the day, with some tissues undergoing more rapid breakdown than others. This is because different tissues have different rates of protein synthesis and degradation, and the overall balance of these processes determines the overall rate of protein turnover."
