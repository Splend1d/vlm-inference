The goal is to identify the strongest argument in support of the statute that would be most effective in defending it against the potential challenge that it might face under the Commerce Clause.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The statute will help racial minorities living in the state obtain gainful employment.**\n   - This option suggests that the statute is aimed at benefiting specific groups, which could be seen as a potential violation of the Commerce Clause if it is used to discriminate against non-citizens. However, it does not directly address the state's own taxpayer funds or the role of the state in creating demand for labor.\n\nB. **The state has the highest unemployment rate in the country.**\n   - This option highlights the state's economic situation but does not directly address the role of the state's own taxpayer funds or the state's ability to create demand for labor.\n\nC. **If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor.**\n   - This option directly addresses the state's role in creating demand for labor. If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor. This aligns with the purpose of the statute, which is to ensure that only citizens of the state are hired for state construction contracts, thereby helping to alleviate the state's high unemployment rate.\n\nD. **The statute was overwhelmingly adopted by the voters of the state.**\n   - This option indicates that the statute was popularly supported by the voters, but it does not directly address the state's role in creating demand for labor or the state's responsibility to hire only citizens of the state.\n\nGiven the analysis, the strongest argument in support of the statute is:\n\n**C. If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the state's role in creating demand for labor, which is the primary purpose of the statute."
