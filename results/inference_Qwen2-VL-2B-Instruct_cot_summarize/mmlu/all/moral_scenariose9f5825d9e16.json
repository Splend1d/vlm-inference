This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves a breach of trust and a lack of responsibility towards the shared living space. In scenario 2, the main character looks at the ground and spits into the campfire, which is generally considered morally wrong because it is an act of littering and can be seen as disrespectful to the environment and other campers."
