He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Search:** The search of the driver's vehicle was conducted during the arrest process. The officer had a reasonable suspicion that the driver was involved in a crime, and the search was conducted to secure her and find evidence related to the arrest. This is a valid search incident to an arrest, which is allowed by law.\n\n2. **Exclusionary Rule:** The exclusionary rule applies to evidence obtained through a search that was not conducted in a lawful manner, such as a warrantless search. However, in this case, the search was conducted in a lawful manner (arrest) and the evidence was seized during the arrest process.\n\n3. **Suppression of Evidence:** The driver moved for suppression of the cocaine, but the court will not grant the motion. The court will consider whether the search was conducted in a lawful manner and whether the evidence was seized during the lawful arrest process. The court will not consider whether the evidence was seized incident to an arrest, as that is not the issue at hand.\n\nTherefore, the motion for suppression will be denied because the search was conducted in a lawful manner and the evidence was seized during the lawful arrest process."
