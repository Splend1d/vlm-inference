O'Sullivan's statement in 1839 refers to the United States' acquisition of the Oregon Territory. The Oregon Country was a vast region that stretched from the Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains, and it was the first territory to be ceded by the United States to a foreign power. The territory was ceded to the United States by the British government in 1846 as part of a negotiated treaty, which was signed in 1846."
