This means we calculate the probability that none of his children are girls and then subtract this from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single child is a girl is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the probability that a single child is a boy is also \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe probability that none of his children are girls is the product of the probabilities that each child is a boy or a girl, which is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least half of his children are girls is \\(1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = 1 - \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{31}{32}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability that at least half of John's five children are girls is \\(\\frac{31}{32}\\), which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)."
