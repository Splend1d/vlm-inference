In about a quarter of households with children, men stay home with the children so their wives can work.\n- This statement is consistent with current research. Many studies have shown that many men are taking on more household responsibilities, including childcare, as a result of the increased availability of childcare facilities and the changing expectations of family roles.\n\nB. Most women believe that there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income.\n- This statement is also consistent with current research. Women are increasingly achieving equal opportunities in the workplace, with more women in managerial and professional roles compared to previous generations.\n\nC. Most men believe that women should be homemakers because men earn more money.\n- This statement is not consistent with current research. While it is true that men earn more money on average, this does not necessarily mean that women should be homemakers. Research has shown that women are more likely to choose to be homemakers due to cultural and societal expectations, not because men earn more money.\n\nD. Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives.\n- This statement is consistent with current research. Many studies have shown that men are often not equally involved in household chores and childcare, which can lead to stress and dissatisfaction for both partners.\n\nTherefore, the options that are consistent with current research are:\n\nA. In about a quarter of households with children, men stay home with the children so their wives can work.\nB. Most women believe that there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income.\nD. Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives."
