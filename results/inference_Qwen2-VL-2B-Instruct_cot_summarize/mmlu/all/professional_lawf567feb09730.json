At the time the contract was signed, the owner orally said to the distributor, \"We do have an understanding that our chef must approve the quality of the heirloom tomatoes before I will pay you. \" The distributor acknowledged the owner's request and responded, \"If you say so. \"Thereafter, the distributor delivered the heirloom tomatoes to the owner. After inspecting the tomatoes, the chef refused to give his approval, because he felt that the tomatoes were not of sufficient quality. As a result, the owner refused to accept and pay for the tomatoes. The distributor brought a breach of contract action against the owner because he refused to pay for the tomatoes. How should the court rule on the owner's offer to prove, over the distributor's objection, that the chef refused to approve the tomatoes that were delivered?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The court should rule that the evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Offer and Acceptance**: The owner's offer to prove that the chef refused to approve the tomatoes was an oral condition precedent to the acceptance of the tomatoes. This is a common legal doctrine known as \"condition precedent\" or \"condition precedent of acceptance.\"\n\n2. **Statute of Frauds**: The court should not rule that the evidence is barred because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds applies to contracts that are too complex or involve too much risk for the parties to understand. In this case, the oral agreement is not too complex or too risky for the parties to understand, as it is a simple oral condition precedent.\n\n3. **Frustration of Purpose**: The court should not rule that the evidence is admissible to show frustration of purpose. The owner's offer to prove that the chef refused to approve the tomatoes was not based on the frustration of purpose but rather on the oral condition precedent.\n\n4. **Complete and Total Integration**: The court should not rule that the evidence is barred because the written contract appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement. The written contract is not a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement, as it includes an oral condition precedent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent."
