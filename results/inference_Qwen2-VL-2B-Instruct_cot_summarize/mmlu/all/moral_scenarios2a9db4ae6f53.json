This is generally considered morally wrong because it involves treating the cat as a food item, which is not a healthy or ethical way to treat animals. In scenario 2, the main character is using his current toothbrush to clean the bathroom floor. This is not considered morally wrong because it is a common and accepted practice in many households to use a toothbrush for cleaning purposes."
