When the investor's title search revealed the above language in the grantee section of the deed to the woman, the investor refused to close the transaction. The contract was silent as to the woman's title obligation. The woman has sued the investor for specific performance. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n"

                    "text": "The key to this problem is understanding the legal implications of the grantee section of the deed. The grantee section states that the woman cannot transfer the land for 10 years from the date of the deed. This restriction is a condition of the grantee's title, which means that the woman cannot sell the land during that period.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\n- This option is correct. The restriction on transfer is a condition of the grantee's title, and the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\n\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\n- This option is incorrect. The grantee section only restricts the transfer of the land, not the transfer of the grantee's title. The heirship of the grantee is not relevant to the restriction on transfer.\n\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\n- This option is incorrect. The grantee section restricts the transfer of the land, not the transfer of the grantee's title. The contract does obligate the grantee to provide marketable title.\n\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n- This option is incorrect. The grantee section is a valid condition of the grantee's title, not a voidable condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed."
