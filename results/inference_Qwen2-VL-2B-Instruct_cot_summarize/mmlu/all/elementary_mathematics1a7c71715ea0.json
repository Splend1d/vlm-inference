The product of 5 and 2 is 10, which is an odd number because it cannot be divided evenly by 2.\n\nB. The product of 4 x 4 is odd because both of the factors are even.\n- This statement is false. The product of 4 and 4 is 16, which is an even number because it can be divided evenly by 2.\n\nC. The product of 2 x 7 is even because both of the factors are odd.\n- This statement is false. The product of 2 and 7 is 14, which is an even number because it can be divided evenly by 2.\n\nD. The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd.\n- This statement is false. The product of 5 and 3 is 15, which is an odd number because it cannot be divided evenly by 2.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that is true is:\n\nA.
