It was a late autunm afternoon, and the football team was practicing for its upcoming game against its archrival. While the team was practicing, the skies darkened as a storm approached. Minutes later, it began to rain heavily. Even though the storm intensified, the coach did not stop the practice because he had no reason to believe the storm presented a danger to his players. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck and killed the team's star player. This jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, and a school board may be sued as a private entity. If the player's parents bring a wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board, will they prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity.\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable.\nC. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\nD. No, because lightning is an act of God.\n"

No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\n\nThe key point here is that the coach was not negligent in continuing the practice despite the storm approaching. The coach did not have a reason to believe that the storm posed a danger to the players, and thus, he did not violate his duty to ensure the safety of his students. The coach's decision to continue the practice was based on a lack of reason to believe the storm posed a danger, which is a defense against liability under the doctrine of governmental immunity.\n\nThe jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, but this does not change the fact that the coach was not negligent in continuing the practice. The coach's decision to continue the practice was based on a lack of reason to believe the storm posed a danger, and thus, he was not liable for the player's death."
