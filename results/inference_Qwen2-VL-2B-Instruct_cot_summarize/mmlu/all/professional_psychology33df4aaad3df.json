It can provide a safe and supportive environment for minority clients to express their feelings and concerns, which can lead to greater emotional and psychological well-being. Additionally, minority clients may benefit from the unique perspectives and experiences that they bring to the therapy process, which can help them develop a more comprehensive understanding of their own experiences and challenges."
