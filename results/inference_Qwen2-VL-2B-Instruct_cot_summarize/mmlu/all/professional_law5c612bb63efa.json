The boyfriend was also an avid baseball fan and had a fanatic devotion to his favorite team. One evening, the boyfriend was watching his beloved team play their archrival on television. His favorite team lost in extra innings. After the game, the boyfriend became despondent and told his girlfriend that he was so disgusted that he was going to kill himself. The boyfriend took one of the pistols from his gun collection and shot himself in the head. As the boyfriend fell to the floor, wounded, his girlfriend couldn't believe her eyes. At first she thought that she should call 911 for an ambulance. But she was afraid that the police might think that she was responsible for the shooting. Consequently, she decided to do nothing. She proceeded to leave the apartment and spent the night at her mother's home. The boyfriend did not immediately die from the gunshot wound. A subsequent medical examiner's report concluded that the boyfriend died from loss of blood approximately two hours after the shooting. If the girlfriend had sought immediate medical assistance, the boyfriend would have lived. The girlfriend is subsequently prosecuted for her boyffiend's death. She should be found\n\nA. guilty of first-degree murder.\nB. guilty of second-degree murder.\nC. guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nD. not guilty, because she had no legal duty to render assistance.\n"

She had a legal duty to seek medical assistance, but she failed to do so. This failure to act can be considered a breach of duty, which is a legal concept that can be used to argue that the girlfriend should be held responsible for the boyfriend's death. Therefore, she should be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter."
