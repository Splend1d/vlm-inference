This action is generally considered morally wrong because it can harm the environment and disrupt the natural ecosystem. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is using olive oil to cook dinner for their cousin with a peanut allergy. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a safe and appropriate alternative to using peanut oil, which could cause an allergic reaction."
