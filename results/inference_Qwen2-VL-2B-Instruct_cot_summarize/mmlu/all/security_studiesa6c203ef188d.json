It emerged in the US and was exported to Europe. European security studies was \"theory has already been done\" kind of work.\nB. The think tanks became routine producers of narrow technical problem-solving succumbing to 'hectic empiricism': the internal logic of its key contribution (deterrence) broke down.\nC. Peace research developed on a parallel but separate track, and particularly the distinct critical branch was seen neither by its representatives nor by security studies as part of the latter.\nD.

This can be done by examining the emergence of new fields of study, the growth of research institutions, and the development of academic institutions that specialize in particular fields of study. Additionally, the period of institutionalization can be assessed by examining the impact of these institutions on the development of academic disciplines and the broader academic community."
