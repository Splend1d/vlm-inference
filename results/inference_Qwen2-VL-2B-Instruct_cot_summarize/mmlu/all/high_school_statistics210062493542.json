An experiment, but with no reasonable conclusion possible about cause and effect\nB. An experiment, thus making cause and effect a reasonable conclusion\nC.

An observational study, but a poorly designed one because randomization was not used.\n\nThis is because the teacher's practice quiz technique is being used as a treatment, and the students' grades are being used as the outcome measure. However, the study lacks a control group, which is essential for establishing causality. Without a control group, it is impossible to determine whether the improvement in grades is due to the practice quiz or some other factor. Therefore, this study is an observational study with a potential for confounding variables."
