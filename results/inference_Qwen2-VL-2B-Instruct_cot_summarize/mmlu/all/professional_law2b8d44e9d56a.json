                    "text": "A state has adopted a system of bifurcated trials in cases in which a defendant's insanity is in issue. According to the bifurcated trial system, whenever a defendant pleads not guilty to an offense by reason of insanity, two trials will be held. The first one will simply determine whether the defendant has committed the offense for which she is charged. This trial will not address the issue of insanity. In the event that it is found that the defendant has, in fact, committed the offense, then a second trial will be conducted to determine whether she should be exculpated for the criminal action by reason of insanity. A woman was arrested and charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At her first trial, the state introduced evidence showing that the woman was having an affair with the victim. When the victim tried to break off their relationship, the woman shot and killed him during a lover's quarrel. The woman was then called to testify in her own behalf. She testified that she had been living with the victim for two years prior to the time of his death. During that period she had undergone psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed as being schizophrenic. She further testified that at the time the victim was killed, she was under the influence of narcotics. While she was hallucinating, she remembered perceiving the victim as a demon and shot at this satanic figure in order to free herself from his evil spell. She then testified that she didn't believe shooting the demon was morally wrong. The prosecuting attorney objected to the woman's testimony. Over such objections, the trial judge admitted the woman's testimony. Was the trial judge correct in admitting the woman's testimony?\n\nA. No, because proof of mental disease requires the use of expert testimony.\nB. No, because testimony relating to her belief that she didn't know what she was doing was wrong, is not relevant until the second trial.\nC. Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime.\nD. Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the issue of self-defense.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the trial judge was correct in admitting the woman's testimony, we need to analyze the bifurcated trial system and the nature of the evidence presented.\n\nThe bifurcated trial system in this case involves two trials:\n1. The first trial determines whether the defendant has committed the offense for which she is charged.\n2. The second trial determines whether she should be exculpated for the criminal action by reason of insanity.\n\nThe key point here is whether the prosecution can present evidence that the defendant was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the murder, which would be relevant to the issue of self-defense.\n\nThe prosecution argues that the woman's testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime. Specifically, the prosecution argues that the woman's testimony about hallucinating and shooting at a demon is relevant to the issue of self-defense.\n\nThe defense argues that the prosecution cannot present evidence that the woman was under the influence of narcotics because the prosecution must use expert testimony to establish the defendant's mental state. This is because the prosecution must prove the defendant's mental state to meet the burden of proof for the insanity defense.\n\nGiven this analysis, the trial judge's decision to admit the woman's testimony is correct because it is relevant to the issue of self-defense. The prosecution has presented evidence that the defendant was under the influence of narcotics at the time of the murder, which is relevant to the issue of self-defense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the issue of self-defense."
