During her testimony, the victim recounted the incident and described how the defendant savagely beat her with a baseball bat. She was not asked by the prosecution whether she made any statements during the attack. After the victim was excused and left the witness stand, the prosecution called another witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, \"I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this. \"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's proffered testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an excited utterance.\nB. admissible as a dying declaration.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused.\n"
