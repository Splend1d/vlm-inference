The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\text{Sample Mean} \\pm (Z \\times \\frac{\\text{Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{n}}) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\text{Sample Mean} \\) is the average building time from the sample of 40 homes, which is 83 days.\n- \\( Z \\) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence level, \\( Z \\) is approximately 1.96.\n- \\( \\text{Standard Deviation} \\) is the standard deviation of the building time, which is 386 days.\n- \\( n \\) is the sample size, which is 40.\n\nFirst, calculate the margin of error:\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = Z \\times \\frac{\\text{Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 1.96 \\times \\frac{386}{\\sqrt{40}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 1.96 \\times \\frac{386}{6.32} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 1.96 \\times 60 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 117.6 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the confidence interval:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\text{Sample Mean} \\pm \\text{Margin of Error} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \\pm 117.6 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = (83 - 117.6, 83 + 117.6) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = (-34.6, 200.6) \\]\n\nSince the building time for a new house can be between 80 and 90 days, we can assert with 95% confidence that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 20.0%"
