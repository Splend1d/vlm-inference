Havelock Ellis\n\nHavelock Ellis, a British psychiatrist and author, is known for his work on the concept of \"punishment by association,\" which suggests that repeated exposure to a particular stimulus can lead to a decrease in the likelihood of that stimulus being experienced. In this context, the pain experienced during intercourse could be seen as a form of punishment, as it is repeatedly associated with the act of intercourse."
