Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design. A significance test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard. The resulting P-value was 0.07. Which is a correct interpretation of this P-value?\n\nA. The null hypothesis should be rejected.\nB. The null hypothesis should be accepted.\nC. There is a 7% chance that the null hypothesis is correct.\nD. There is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.\n"
