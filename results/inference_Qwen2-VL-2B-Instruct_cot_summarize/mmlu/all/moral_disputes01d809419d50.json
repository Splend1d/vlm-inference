The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible.\n\nThe doctrine of double effect refers to the principle that an action is morally permissible if it is intrinsically permissible and if its effects are morally permissible. This means that the action itself must be morally permissible, and its effects must also be morally permissible. The other options do not accurately reflect this principle. Option B suggests that the action is morally permissible only because of its effects, which is not the core idea of the doctrine. Option C implies that no actual person would endorse the action, which is not the focus of the doctrine. Option D suggests that the action is valuable because of its relationship to intrinsically valuable things, which is not the core idea of the doctrine."
