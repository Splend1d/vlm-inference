Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nBased on both passages, which of the following conclusions can be most reasonably made about revolutions?\n\nA. The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed.\nB. The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities.\nC. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.\nD. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.\n"

The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed.**\n   - The passage by Olympe de Gouges mentions that the Revolution did not achieve the hoped-for benefits for women and ethnic minorities, and she expresses a sense of disappointment and frustration. This suggests that the new liberties gained by revolution were not always worth the bloodshed.\n\n2. **B. The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities.**\n   - This option is somewhat similar to option A, but it specifically mentions women and ethnic minorities. The passage by Halima Ghomri does not specifically mention women or ethnic minorities, so this option is not directly supported by the information.\n\n3. **C. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.**\n   - The passage by Olympe de Gouges mentions that the Revolution did not achieve the hoped-for benefits for women and ethnic minorities, which implies that the distribution of new liberties was not always equitable or consistent.\n\n4. **D. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.**\n   - The passage by Halima Ghomri mentions that the Revolution did not achieve the hoped-for benefits for women and ethnic minorities, but it does not specifically mention economic improvement. Therefore, this option is not directly supported by the information.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most reasonable conclusion about revolutions based on the provided information is:\n\n**C. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.**"
