Digging troughs in the sand from the nests to the sea\n\nThis practice is the most environmentally sound because it allows the hatchlings to naturally orient to the sea, reducing the risk of them getting lost or injured. Artificial lighting and building fences can disrupt the natural behavior of the sea turtles, while scattering preferred turtle foods may not be effective in attracting the hatchlings to the sea."
