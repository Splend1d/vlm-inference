To break out of this cycle, Walzer suggests using psychological rather than military tactics. This approach involves using non-violent means to address the underlying issues that lead to terrorism, such as poverty, social inequality, and political instability. By focusing on addressing these underlying causes, it is hoped that the cycle of violence can be broken and a more peaceful and stable society can be achieved."
