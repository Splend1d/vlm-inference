This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves a violation of the patron's right to privacy and freedom of movement. In Scenario 2, the main character keeps the corpses in the garage because they would really stink up the house. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a practical decision to manage the disposal of dead bodies, which is a common and accepted practice in many societies."
