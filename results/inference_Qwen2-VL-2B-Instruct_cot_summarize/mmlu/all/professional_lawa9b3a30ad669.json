This is because the debtor's bankruptcy discharge of the debt means that the debtor is no longer legally responsible for the debt. Therefore, the creditor is not entitled to recover the full amount of the debt, which is $15,000.00. However, the creditor is still entitled to recover the amount of the debt that was not discharged, which is $5,000.00. This is because the debtor's bankruptcy discharge only applies to the debt that was not discharged, and the creditor is still entitled to recover the amount of the debt that was discharged."
