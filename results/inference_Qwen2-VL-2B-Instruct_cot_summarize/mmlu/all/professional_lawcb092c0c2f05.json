                    "text": "The farmer will most likely prevail, because the friend acquired title to the farm by quitclaim deed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Title Transfer**: The investor conveyed the farm to the friend by quitclaim deed. This means the friend acquired title to the farm without any transfer of title from the investor to the friend. This is a common method of transferring title in real estate, where the transfer is not documented in a formal deed but rather through a written agreement.\n\n2. **Delegation of Duties**: The deed instrument states that the friend \"assumed the mortgage.\" This implies that the friend assumed the obligations and duties of the investor in the mortgage. However, the farmer is a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend, which means the farmer is entitled to recover the amount of the mortgage due to the investor.\n\n3. **Effect of the Deed**: The fact that the friend assumed the mortgage does not automatically transfer the mortgage to the friend. The mortgage is still held by the investor, and the farmer is a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend. The farmer is entitled to recover the amount of the mortgage due to the investor.\n\n4. **Default and Recovery**: The investor defaulted on the mortgage, and the farmer brought an in personam action against the friend to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The farmer is a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend, and the farmer is entitled to recover the amount of the mortgage due to the investor.\n\nTherefore, the farmer will most likely prevail because the friend acquired title to the farm by quitclaim deed, and the farmer is a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend."
