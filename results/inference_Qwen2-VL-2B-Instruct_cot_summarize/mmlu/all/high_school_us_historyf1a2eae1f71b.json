                    "text": "To determine which president is most closely associated with the concept of Manifest Destiny, we need to analyze the information provided in the context of John L. O'Sullivan's essay \"The Great Nation of Futurity\" from 1839.\n\nThe essay discusses the potential greatness of the United States in the future, emphasizing its role in space and time, and the potential for the nation to manifest divine principles and establish a \"Temple of the Most High\" on Earth. It also mentions the idea of a \"Union of many Republics\" and the concept of brotherhood.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. James K. Polk - This president was known for his expansionist policies, including the annexation of Texas and the Mexican War. While he did support the idea of Manifest Destiny, his actions were more focused on territorial expansion rather than the idea of a \"Temple of the Most High\" or brotherhood.\n\nB. Andrew Johnson - This president was known for his efforts to expand the territories of the United States, including the acquisition of new territories through the Homestead Act and the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. While he did support the idea of Manifest Destiny, his actions were more focused on territorial expansion rather than the idea of brotherhood.\n\nC. Woodrow Wilson - This president is most closely associated with the concept of Manifest Destiny. He was a strong supporter of the idea of Manifest Destiny and his presidency was marked by the expansion of the United States through the acquisition of new territories and the expansion of the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nD. Ronald Reagan - This president was known for his efforts to reduce the size of the federal government and his support for the idea of a \"small government\" rather than the idea of Manifest Destiny.\n\nBased on the analysis, the president most closely associated with the concept of Manifest Destiny is Woodrow Wilson.\n\nFinal answer: C. Woodrow Wilson"
