Protons have a positive charge and are found in the nucleus, while neutrons have no charge and are found in the nucleus as well. Protons and neutrons have both orbital and spin angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum is due to the motion of the electron around the nucleus, while the spin angular momentum is due to the spin of the proton or neutron."
