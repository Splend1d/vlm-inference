The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The buildings' other floors were rented to professionals and used as offices. There was an enclosed walkway that connected the second floor of each building. Thus, shoppers and office staff could walk across the common walkway and gain access to each building. While the buildings were being used in this manner, the millionaire sold the dental building to an investor by warranty deed, which made no mention of any rights concerning the walkway. The walkway continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. Thereafter, the walkway became unsafe as a consequence of wear and tear. As a result, the investor hired a contractor to repair the walkway area. When the millionaire saw the contractor removing the carpeting along the walkway, he demanded that the investor discontinue the repair work. After the investor refused, the millionaire brought an action to enjoin the investor from continuing the work. The most likely result will be a decision for\n\nA. the millionaire, because the investor does not have rights in the walkway.\nB. the millionaire, because the investor's rights in the dental building do not extend to the walkway.\nC. the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\nD. the investor, because he has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect himself from possible tort liability from persons using the walkway.\n"

This right is implied by the fact that the walkway is part of the common area of the buildings.\n\n2. **Implied Right to Keep the Walkway in Repair**: The investor also has an implied right to keep the walkway in repair. This right is derived from the fact that the walkway is a part of the common area of the buildings, and the investor has a duty to maintain the common areas for the benefit of all occupants.\n\n3. **Right to Take Action to Protect Themselves**: The investor has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect themselves from possible tort liability from persons using the walkway. This right is based on the investor's duty to maintain the common areas for the safety and well-being of all occupants.\n\n4. **Right to Use the Walkway**: The investor has the right to use the walkway for their own purposes, including repairing it. This right is derived from the easement and implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\n\nGiven these points, the investor has a legal right to repair the walkway, and the millionaire's demand that the investor discontinue the repair work would likely be rejected by the court. Therefore, the most likely result will be a decision for the investor."
