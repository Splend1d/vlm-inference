Job performance for older workers depends both upon the decline of skills and the benefits of experience\n\nOlder workers may perform better than younger workers because they have accumulated more experience and knowledge over time, which can lead to better problem-solving skills, adaptability, and resilience. However, they may also experience a decline in physical and mental abilities, which can affect their job performance. Therefore, job performance for older workers can be influenced by both their experience and the decline of their skills."
