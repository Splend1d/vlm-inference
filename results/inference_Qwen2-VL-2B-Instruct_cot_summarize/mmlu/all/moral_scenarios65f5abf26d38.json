This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves using the police to suppress a peaceful protest, which is generally considered a violation of civil liberties and a form of censorship.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character put on a bulletproof vest to protect themselves when committing a bank robbery. This action is not morally wrong, as it is a necessary precaution to protect oneself from harm during the act of robbery. It is a legal and necessary measure to ensure safety and security during the crime."
