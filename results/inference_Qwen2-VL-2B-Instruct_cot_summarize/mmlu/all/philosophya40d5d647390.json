Socrates claims to be ignorant of these essences but is wise in recognizing that without such knowledge, actions are unjustified.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.**\n   - This option suggests that admitting ignorance is a necessary condition for wisdom. However, the context does not explicitly state that admitting ignorance is a necessary condition for wisdom. It only mentions that Socrates recognizes ignorance but does not explicitly state that admitting ignorance is a necessary condition for wisdom.\n\nB. **He knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.**\n   - This option suggests that Socrates knows what he is looking for, which is knowledge of the essences of things. However, the context does not provide information about Socrates' knowledge of the essences of things. This option is not supported by the given information.\n\nC. **Knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.**\n   - This option suggests that knowing the essence of something is impossible because it would require knowing what we are looking for before we know what it is. This is a valid point, but it does not directly address the context about Socrates' wisdom in recognizing ignorance and the importance of knowledge of the essence.\n\nD. **His method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.**\n   - This option suggests that Socrates' method of asking questions about essences is unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice. This is a valid point, but it does not directly address the context about Socrates' wisdom in recognizing ignorance and the importance of knowledge of the essence.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the context about Socrates' wisdom in recognizing ignorance and the importance of knowledge of the essence."
