Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\n\nExplanation:\n- Option A is correct. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\n- Option B is correct. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization.\n- Option C is correct. Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\n- Option D is incorrect. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, does not lead to sperm aggregation on the beads. This is because the sperm's acrosomal reaction is initiated by binding to ZP3, not by binding to ZP2."
