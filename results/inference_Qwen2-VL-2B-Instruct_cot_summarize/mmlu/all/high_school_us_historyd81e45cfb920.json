I come to place before the Legislature of Massachusetts the condition of the miserable, the desolate, the outcast. I come as the advocate of helpless, forgotten, insane and idiotic men and women; of beings, sunk to a condition from which the most unconcerned would start with real horror; of beings wretched in our Prisons, and more wretched in our Alms-Houses. . . .\n\"If my pictures are displeasing, coarse, and severe, my subjects, it must be recollected, offer no tranquil, refined, or composing features. The condition of human beings, reduced to the extremest states of degradation and misery, cannot be exhibited in softened language, or adorn a polished page.\n\"I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience!\"\n\u2014Dorothea Dix, \"Memorial to the Massachusetts Legislature\" (1843)\nDorothea Dix's testimony to the Massachusetts legislature reflects the influence of which of the following?\n\nA.

The Second Great Awakening.\n\nDorothea Dix's testimony to the Massachusetts legislature reflects the influence of the Second Great Awakening, which was a period of intense religious fervor and social reform in the 19th century. Dix's work, \"Memorial to the Massachusetts Legislature,\" was part of a broader movement to address social issues such as the treatment of the mentally ill and the poor, which were seen as a reflection of societal ills and a call for reform. The Second Great Awakening emphasized the importance of religious reform and the need to address social problems, which is consistent with Dix's advocacy for the mentally ill and the poor."
