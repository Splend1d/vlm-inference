Multiple-choice\n\nMultiple-choice tests are generally considered to be less likely to be challenged on the grounds of adverse impact, as they are designed to measure knowledge and skills rather than subjective opinions or attitudes. Projective tests, which require respondents to express their thoughts or feelings, can be more susceptible to bias and are therefore less likely to withstand legal challenge. Empirically keyed tests, which are based on standardized scores, are also less likely to be challenged on the grounds of adverse impact. Work samples, which involve a specific task or activity, are also less likely to be challenged on the grounds of adverse impact."
