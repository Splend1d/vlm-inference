In this case, the owner took the car without the mechanic's consent, which is a key element of larceny.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Not guilty - This option suggests that the owner should not be found guilty because the car was his own property. However, this is not necessarily the case. The owner's actions were unauthorized and without consent, which is a sufficient basis for larceny.\n\nB. Not guilty - This option suggests that the owner should not be found guilty if the servicing charge was considered reasonable. However, the owner's unauthorized taking of the car without consent is a sufficient basis for larceny, regardless of whether the charge was reasonable.\n\nC. Guilty - This option suggests that the owner should be found guilty if the jurisdiction has a statute making theft of services a crime. However, the owner's actions were not theft of services but rather unauthorized taking of the car without consent.\n\nD. Guilty - This option suggests that the owner should be found guilty because he took the car without the mechanic's consent. This is the correct interpretation, as the owner's unauthorized taking of the car without consent is the basis for larceny.\n\nTherefore, the owner should be found guilty, based on the legal principle of larceny. The correct answer is:\n\nD. Guilty, because he took the car without the mechanic's consent."
