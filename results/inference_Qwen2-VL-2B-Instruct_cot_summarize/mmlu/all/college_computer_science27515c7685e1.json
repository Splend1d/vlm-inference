This is the probability of the chip being from Company Y and being defective, divided by the probability of the chip being defective:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Company Y} | \\text{defective}) = \\frac{P(\\text{defective} \\cap \\text{Company Y})}{P(\\text{defective})} \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{defective} \\cap \\text{Company Y}) = P(\\text{defective} | \\text{Company Y}) \\times P(\\text{Company Y}) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{defective} | \\text{Company Y}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Company Y}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chip came from Company Y given that it is defective is:\n\\[ P(\\text{Company Y} | \\text{defective}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nC. 1 / 2"
