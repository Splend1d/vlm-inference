The passage discusses the urgency of perestroika and its necessity due to the development of socialist society. It highlights that any delay in perestroika could lead to serious social, economic, and political crises.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The problems that required perestroika were the fault of capitalist enemies of socialism.\n- This option suggests that the problems were caused by external forces, which is not supported by the passage. The passage emphasizes the internal development of socialist society as the primary reason for perestroika.\n\nB. The problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society.\n- This option aligns well with the passage. It states that perestroika is necessary because the socialist society is ripe for change and has long been yearning for it. This implies that the problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society.\n\nC. A socialist society could not work.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss the feasibility or the potential failure of a socialist society.\n\nD. A socialist society could not coexist with capitalism.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not compare socialism with capitalism or discuss the coexistence of socialism with capitalism.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most accurate inference from the passage is:\n\nB. The problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society.\n\nFinal answer: B"
