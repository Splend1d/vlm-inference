An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following is the best description of the plans being changed above?\n\nA.

The passage discusses the belief that unless working-class aspirations were met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia.\n2. By 1920, this fear receded, and Addison's policy was seen as extravagant.\n3. The Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, which was approved in September 1920, was deferred by the Government's Housing Board.\n4. The Housing Board deferred the scheme due to the Council's present commitments and the limited money available.\n5. In May 1921, the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\nGiven these points, the best description of the plans being changed is:\n\nC. Workers were threatening communist revolution.\n\nThis option aligns with the passage's mention of the belief that a revolution similar to that in Russia might occur if working-class aspirations were not met, which suggests a shift in the government's priorities and policies towards housing and social welfare."
