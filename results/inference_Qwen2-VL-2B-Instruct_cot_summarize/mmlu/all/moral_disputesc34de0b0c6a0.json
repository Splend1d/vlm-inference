Wellman's argument is that freedom of association is more important in the marital context than in the political realm.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. There is no freedom of association in the marital context.\n- This option contradicts the core of the question, which is to evaluate the relative importance of freedom of association in the two contexts.\n\nB. His argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important.\n- This option aligns with Wellman's argument, which suggests that freedom of association is more important in the marital context than in the political realm.\n\nC. Freedom of association is equally important in both contexts.\n- This option contradicts Wellman's argument, which states that freedom of association is more important in the marital context.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This option is not applicable because Wellman's argument is clearly stated and does not require any of the options provided.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. His argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important."
