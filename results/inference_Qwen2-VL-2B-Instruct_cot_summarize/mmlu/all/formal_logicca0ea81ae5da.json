This can be broken down into three conditions:\n1. The restaurant serves pie.\n2. The restaurant serves cheesecake.\n3. The restaurant serves ice cream.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. P \u2228 (C \u2228 I) - This option suggests that the restaurant serves pie or cheesecake or ice cream. This is not the best symbolization because it does not explicitly state that the restaurant serves all three desserts.\n\nB. (P \u2228 C) \u2228 I - This option suggests that the restaurant serves pie or cheesecake or ice cream. This is not the best symbolization because it does not explicitly state that the restaurant serves all three desserts.\n\nC. P \u2228 C \u2228 I - This option suggests that the restaurant serves pie, cheesecake, or ice cream. This is the best symbolization because it explicitly states that the restaurant serves all three desserts.\n\nD. Options A and B - This option suggests that the restaurant serves pie or cheesecake or ice cream. This is not the best symbolization because it does not explicitly state that the restaurant serves all three desserts.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\n\nC.
