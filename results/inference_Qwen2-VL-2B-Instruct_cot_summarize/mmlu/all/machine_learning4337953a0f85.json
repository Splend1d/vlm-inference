Highway networks were introduced before ResNets and do not eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions. Instead, they use a combination of max pooling and convolutional layers.\n\nStatement 2: DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets.\n- This statement is false. DenseNets, which are a type of neural network architecture, do not generally cost more memory than ResNets. In fact, DenseNets are often designed to be more memory-efficient due to their structure and the way they process data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
