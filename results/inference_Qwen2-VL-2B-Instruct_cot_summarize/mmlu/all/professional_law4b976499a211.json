Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate?\n\nA. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\nB. Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.\nC. Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.\nD. Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.\n"

Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\n\nThis option aligns with the principle that the state's employment policies must be narrowly tailored to serve a legitimate state interest. The state's policy of prohibiting female officers from the special narcotics division is not related to an important state interest, as it is based on a discriminatory gender-based classification. The state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers is not a legitimate state interest that justifies the policy. Therefore, the state's policy is not substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest, and the woman's suit is likely to succeed."
