As it grew dark and the snow continued, he realized he was completely lost. He felt sure that he would freeze to death during the night. When all hope seemed lost, he stumbled across a small cabin. He knocked on the door, but no one answered. He tried to open the door, realized it was not locked, and went inside. In the cabin, he found some food to eat and some blankets that kept him warm through the night. By the next morning, the snow had stopped, and he was able to make his way out of the forest. If the owner of the cabin sues the hiker, seeking to recover damages for the cost of the food and for the use of his cabin, what is the most likely outcome of the case?\n\nA. The hiker does not owe anything because the importance of his survival outweighs the property interests of the cabin owner.\nB. The hiker must pay for the cost of the food and the rental value of the cabin for one night.\nC. The hiker must pay for the use of the cabin, but nothing else.\nD. The hiker must pay for the cost of the food, but nothing else.\n"

The hiker must pay for the cost of the food and the rental value of the cabin for one night.\n\nThis is because the hiker's survival was the primary concern during the blizzard, and the cabin provided him with the necessary food and shelter to survive the night. The owner of the cabin, therefore, has a property interest in the cabin, and the hiker's survival was a significant factor in his decision to use the cabin. The owner may argue that the hiker's survival was a reasonable justification for using the cabin, but the court would likely consider the balance of interests and the importance of the hiker's survival in determining the outcome."
