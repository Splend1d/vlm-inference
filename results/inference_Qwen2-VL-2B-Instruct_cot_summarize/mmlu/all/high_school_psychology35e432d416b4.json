Virginia, a 14-year-old Caucasian female, who is a C student, is sexually promiscuous, and is experimenting with drugs.\n\nAnorexia nervosa is a life-threatening illness that can lead to permanent physiological changes such as brittle bones and even death. It is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, which can lead to an extreme restriction of food intake and a distorted body image. This can result in a severe loss of weight, which can cause other health problems, including anemia, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, the use of drugs and alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms and make it more difficult to manage the illness. Therefore, individuals who are sexually promiscuous, experimenting with drugs, and struggling with debt from school are at the highest risk of developing anorexia nervosa."
