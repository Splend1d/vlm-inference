                    "text": "The Native American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Native Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\n\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\n"

The key constitutional provisions to consider are those related to voting rights and the protection of individual rights.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n   - This clause guarantees due process of law, which includes the right to a fair trial and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. It does not directly address the exclusion of non-Native American members or the election of a \"Native American Power\" candidate.\n\nB. **The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.**\n   - This clause guarantees the right to assemble peacefully for the purpose of petitioning the government. It does not specifically address the exclusion of non-Native American members or the election of a \"Native American Power\" candidate.\n\nC. **The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n   - This clause guarantees equal protection under the law, which includes the right to vote. It does not specifically address the exclusion of non-Native American members or the election of a \"Native American Power\" candidate.\n\nD. **The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.**\n   - This clause guarantees the right to vote, which includes the right to vote in federal elections. It does not specifically address the exclusion of non-Native American members or the election of a \"Native American Power\" candidate.\n\nGiven the context, the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party would be related to the right to vote, as it directly relates to the voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.**"
