This is because at this point, the firm is earning the highest possible profit.\n\nThe marginal cost (MC) is the cost of producing one more unit of output. The marginal revenue (MR) is the revenue from selling one more unit of output.\n\nFor a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal revenue (MR) is equal to the price (P) of the good. This is because the firm is selling at the market price, and the price is equal to the marginal revenue.\n\nTherefore, the profit-maximizing decision for a perfectly competitive firm is to produce at the level where the price (P) is equal to the marginal cost (MC), which is the minimum average total cost (MATC).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. is equal to minimum average total cost."
