                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The problem states that John needs to choose 4 marbles, with exactly one of them being red, green, or blue. This means we are essentially choosing 3 more marbles from the remaining 10 (since we already have one red, one green, and one blue marble).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 10 is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 10\\) (the total number of marbles) and \\(k = 3\\) (the number of marbles to choose). So, we have:\n\n\\[C(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3!7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\\]\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to choose 3 marbles from 10, which means there are 120 ways to choose exactly one red, one green, or one blue marble from the remaining 10 marbles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 84"
