The complement of \"at least one child develops a cavity\" is \"no child develops a cavity.\" \n\nThe probability of no child developing a cavity is the probability that each child does not develop a cavity, which is \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\) (since 2 out of 7 children develop cavities).\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one child develops a cavity is:\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) \\]\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - \\frac{2}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq 1) = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{2}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq 1) = \\frac{5}{7} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0)"
