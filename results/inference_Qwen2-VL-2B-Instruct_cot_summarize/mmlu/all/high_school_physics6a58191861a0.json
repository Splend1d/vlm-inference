                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the motion of the stone in two dimensions: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal motion is affected by gravity, while the vertical motion is affected by air resistance.\n\n1. **Horizontal Motion**: The stone is thrown horizontally with an initial speed of 10 m/s. The horizontal component of its velocity remains constant throughout its motion. The time it takes to travel a horizontal distance \\(d\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{horizontal}} = \\frac{d}{v_{\\text{horizontal}}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(v_{\\text{horizontal}}\\) is the horizontal velocity. Since the stone is thrown horizontally, its horizontal velocity is constant and equal to the initial velocity:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{horizontal}} = \\frac{80}{10} = 8 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\n2. **Vertical Motion**: The stone is thrown vertically downward from a height of 80 m. The vertical component of its velocity is given by:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{vertical}} = v_{\\text{initial}} - g \\cdot t_{\\text{vertical}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(v_{\\text{initial}}\\) is the initial velocity, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2), and \\(t_{\\text{vertical}}\\) is the time it takes to reach the water.\n\nSince the stone is thrown horizontally, its initial vertical velocity is zero. The time it takes to reach the water is the same as the time it takes to travel the horizontal distance, which we found to be 8 seconds. Therefore, the vertical velocity at this time is:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{vertical}} = 0 - 9.8 \\cdot 8 = -78.4 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the stone is moving downward. The time it takes to reach the water is the same as the time it takes to fall 80 m, which is:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{vertical}} = \\frac{80}{-78.4} \\approx 1.02 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nCombining the horizontal and vertical times, the total time it takes for the stone to strike the water is:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{total}} = t_{\\text{horizontal}} + t_{\\text{vertical}} = 8 + 1.02 = 9.02 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 8 s**"
