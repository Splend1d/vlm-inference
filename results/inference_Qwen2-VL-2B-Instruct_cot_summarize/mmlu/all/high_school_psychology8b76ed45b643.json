Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?\n\nA. Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.\nB. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.\nC. The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.\nD.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.\n"

The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.\n\nThis interpretation acknowledges that the student's native language skills in social English are already well-developed, which is why she has difficulty with the basal reader in her English second grade class. The difficulty in reading is likely due to the complexity of the English language, which is not as rich in social context as her native language. This suggests that the student's reading difficulties are not due to a lack of English proficiency but rather to the inherent complexity of the English language."
