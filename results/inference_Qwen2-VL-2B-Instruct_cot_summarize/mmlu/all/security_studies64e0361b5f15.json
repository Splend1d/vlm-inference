Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.\nB. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\nC. In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.\nD. Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.\n"

Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.\n\nCoercive diplomacy success is problematic because it can lead to a perception of cheap success, where the use of threats and sanctions is seen as a cheap way to achieve compliance, rather than as a costly and potentially irreversible action. This can undermine the effectiveness of coercive diplomacy and make it less likely to be used in the future. Additionally, the use of limited force can be seen as a costly and potentially ineffective approach, as it may not be able to achieve the desired outcome and may lead to unintended consequences."
