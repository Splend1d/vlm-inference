The nature of the act causing the death.\n\nIn most states, the division of homicide into degrees is based on the nature of the act causing the death. This typically involves distinguishing between first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and third-degree murder. First-degree murder involves the intentional killing of another person, while second-degree murder involves the intentional killing of another person with malice aforethought (a state of mind of malice). Third-degree murder involves the intentional killing of another person with malice, but without the intent to cause death.\n\nThe other options are not relevant to the classification of homicide degrees:\n\nA. The causal relationship between the defendant's act and the resulting death is not a factor in determining the degree of murder.\nB. The attendant circumstances surrounding the death are not a factor in determining the degree of murder.\nD. The defendant's state of mind at the time the killing was committed is not a factor in determining the degree of murder."
