Whether we allow classes to have different mean vectors or we force them to share the same mean vector.\n\nThis is because the choice of mean vector affects the complexity of the Gaussian distribution that is learned. If the classes have different mean vectors, the Gaussian distribution will be more complex and will be able to capture more of the variability in the data. This can lead to overfitting, as the model will be able to fit the training data too closely and may not generalize well to new data. On the other hand, if the classes have the same mean vector, the Gaussian distribution will be simpler and will be less able to capture the variability in the data. This can lead to underfitting, as the model will not be able to fit the training data well enough and may not generalize well to new data. Therefore, the choice of mean vector is a critical factor in determining the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting."
