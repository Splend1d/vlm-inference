When the elevator stopped on the fifth floor, a man entered the elevator smoking a cigar. The man was standing in front of the elderly woman on the elevator when the woman tapped him on the shoulder. When the man turned around, the woman pointed to the \"No Smoking\" sign and said, \"Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting that cigar out?\" The man indignantly responded by inhaling heavily on his cigar, and then he blew a big puff of smoke into the woman's face. When the elevator stopped on the next floor, the man then departed. If the woman brings a civil suit against the man for battery, who will prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because the smoke touched her face.\nB. The woman, because she had a reasonable basis for fearing that the man would attack her.\nC. The man, because he did not touch the woman.\nD. The man, because his conduct was annoying but did not inflict any bodily injury on the woman.\n"

The woman's claim of battery is based on the man's actions of inhaling and blowing smoke into her face, which is a direct and specific act that caused her harm. The smoke touching her face is a physical contact that constitutes battery. Therefore, the man's conduct is actionable and the woman has a reasonable basis for fearing that he would attack her. The other options are not applicable because the woman did not touch the man, and the man's actions were not annoying but rather harmful."
