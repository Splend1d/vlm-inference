The numbers on the vertices are the products of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to the vertex. So, the numbers on the vertices are $ab, ac, ad, ae, af, bc, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf, de, df, ef$.\n\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is given as $1001$. So, we have the equation $ab + ac + ad + ae + af + bc + bd + be + bf + cd + ce + cf + de + df + ef = 1001$.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $(a + b + c + d + e + f)(ab + ac + ad + ae + af + bc + bd + be + bf + cd + ce + cf + de + df + ef) = 1001$.\n\nSince the numbers on the faces are positive integers, we know that $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are all positive integers. Also, since the numbers on the vertices are the products of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to the vertex, we know that $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are all positive integers.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for $a, b, c, d, e, f$.
