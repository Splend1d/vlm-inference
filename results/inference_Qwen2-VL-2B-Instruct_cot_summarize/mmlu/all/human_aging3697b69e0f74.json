Congruence\n\nThe idea that the ability to complete a task depends on the fit between the environment and the person undertaking the task is a basic tenet of the Congruence theory of aging. Congruence theory suggests that individuals are more likely to succeed in tasks that match their abilities and interests, and that the environment should be designed to facilitate this match. This theory is often associated with the idea of \"fitting in\" or \"fitting the environment\" to achieve optimal performance."
