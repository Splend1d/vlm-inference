The friend was angry with the young man and decided to use the opportunity to get even with him by having him arrested. The friend said he would help, and that night, he drove the young man to the neighbor\u00d5s house. The young man broke in while the friend remained out-side. The friend called the police on his cell phone and then drove away. Police officers arrived at the scene just as the young man was carrying the TV out the back door. The jurisdiction defines crimes as at common law. Of what crime, if any, can the friend properly be convicted?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Conspiracy.\nC. Burglary.\nD. Conspiracy and larceny.\n"

Conspiracy and larceny.\n\nThe friend, by helping the young man break into the neighbor's house and then assisting him in carrying the stolen television, can be convicted of both conspiracy and larceny. Conspiracy is a crime where two or more people conspire to commit a crime, and larceny is the act of stealing property. The friend's actions align with both of these definitions, making him accountable for both crimes."
