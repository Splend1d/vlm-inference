However, Skylar is consuming the second piece of cake, which means he is consuming it at a cost. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Option B: The total benefit received from eating cake is falling.**\n   - This option suggests that Skylar is consuming cake at a cost that is greater than the benefit he receives from it. However, Skylar is consuming the second piece of cake, which means he is consuming it at a cost. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\n3. **Option C: The ratio of marginal benefit over marginal cost is less than one.**\n   - This option suggests that Skylar is consuming the second piece of cake at a cost that is less than the benefit he receives from it. This is consistent with the idea that Skylar is consuming the cake at a cost that is less than the benefit he receives, which is a necessary condition for the marginal benefit of the second piece of cake to be less than the marginal cost.\n\n4. **Option D: The marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is greater than the marginal cost.**\n   - This option suggests that Skylar is consuming the second piece of cake at a cost that is greater than the benefit he receives from it. This is not necessarily true because Skylar is consuming the second piece of cake, which means he is consuming it at a cost. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The ratio of marginal benefit over marginal cost is less than one.**"
