On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.\nLet the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.\nJerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.\"\nPope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.\nUrban II's discussion of Jerusalem in the third paragraph is best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA. Pilgrimages to centers of religious significance\nB. Eradication of heresies\nC. The reconstruction of trade routes\nD. Developments in religious art\n"

The reconstruction of trade routes\n\nThe third paragraph of Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont, dated 1095 C.E., discusses Jerusalem in the context of the reconstruction of trade routes. The Pope emphasizes the importance of Jerusalem as a center of religious significance and the need for the Christian community to take action against the Persians and other enemies who have invaded and depopulated the Christians. He argues that Jerusalem is the navel of the world and that the Christian community has a duty to defend and recover this holy city. The passage also mentions the need for the Christian community to engage in military actions to defend the holy city and to recover lost territory."
