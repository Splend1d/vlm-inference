If you feel that your feelings about Hermann's political views would interfere with your ability to provide him with appropriate therapy, it is important to consult with another psychologist or a supervisor to ensure that your feelings do not affect your professional judgment. Discussing the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process is also important to maintain objectivity and professionalism. However, it is not appropriate to provide Hermann with inappropriate referrals or to see him in therapy until his current crisis is over and then make a referral if necessary."
