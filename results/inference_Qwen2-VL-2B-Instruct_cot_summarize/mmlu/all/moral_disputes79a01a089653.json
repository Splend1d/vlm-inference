It holds that the punishment should fit the crime and that the wrongdoer should be punished for their actions. The theory does not claim that specific punishments are justified based on the overall intrinsic value that they produce, nor does it claim that the death penalty might be morally justified in some cases of murder. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the punishment should fit the crime."
