An increase in household income will increase the equilibrium price but the change in quantity is ambiguous.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Increase in Household Income**: An increase in household income generally leads to an increase in consumer spending power. This means that consumers are more willing to spend on goods and services, including DVDs. As a result, the demand for DVDs increases, leading to an increase in the equilibrium quantity of DVDs.\n\n2. **Equilibrium Quantity**: The equilibrium quantity of a good is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. An increase in demand (due to higher income) shifts the demand curve to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium quantity.\n\n3. **Equilibrium Price**: The equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves at the equilibrium quantity. An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right, which shifts the equilibrium quantity to the right but does not necessarily change the equilibrium price. If the supply curve is also to the right, the equilibrium price will remain unchanged. If the supply curve is to the left, the equilibrium price will decrease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
