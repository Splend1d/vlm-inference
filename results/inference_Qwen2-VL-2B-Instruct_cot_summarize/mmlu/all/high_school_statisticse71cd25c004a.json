The exam is normed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 9. Only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation. Estrella received a 90 on the test. What was her percentile rank on the test, and did she qualify for further evaluation?\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n"

The z-score formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( X \\) is the score Estrella received,\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the distribution,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( X = 90 \\),\n- \\( \\mu = 80 \\),\n- \\( \\sigma = 9 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{90 - 80}{9} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.11 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the percentile rank. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the area under the curve from the z-score of 1.11 to the left. This area represents the percentage of scores that are lower than Estrella's score.\n\nLooking up the z-score of 1.11 in a standard normal distribution table, we find that the area to the left of z = 1.11 is approximately 0.8665.\n\nTherefore, Estrella's percentile rank is 86.65, which corresponds to option C. She qualified for further evaluation."
