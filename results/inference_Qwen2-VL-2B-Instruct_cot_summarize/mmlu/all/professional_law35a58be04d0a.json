After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, prior to determination of compensation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of its property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking.\"\n\nThis option aligns with the principle that the power of eminent domain may only be exercised for a public purpose and that the state court's order to surrender the land to the corporation is a proper exercise of that power. The court's order is not an \"irreparable injury\" to the timber company, as it is not a \"taking\" of the land for a public purpose."
