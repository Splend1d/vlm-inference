L2 regularization (also known as L2 norm) encourages the model to have fewer non-zero coefficients, which results in sparser models compared to L1 regularization, which encourages the model to have more non-zero coefficients.\n\nStatement 2: Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers.\n- True. Residual connections are a common feature in ResNets and Transformers, which are deep neural networks used for image recognition and natural language processing tasks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
