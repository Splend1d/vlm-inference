It supports the idea that there is a single right answer in certain cases.\n\n2. **Option B: The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.**\n   - This statement aligns with Dworkin's view that rights play a significant role in determining cases. It supports the idea that there is a single right answer in most cases.\n\n3. **Option C: Judges exercise strong discretion.**\n   - This statement contradicts Dworkin's claim. Dworkin argues that there is only one right answer, implying that judges should make decisions based on a single principle or principle of law. However, strong discretion suggests that judges have considerable latitude in their decisions, which is inconsistent with the idea of a single right answer.\n\n4. **Option D: Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.**\n   - This statement aligns with Dworkin's view that judges should consider the broader context and history of the case. It supports the idea that there is a single right answer in many cases.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that **Option C: Judges exercise strong discretion** is most inconsistent with Dworkin's claim that to every legal question there is only one right answer.\n\nFinal answer: **C**"
