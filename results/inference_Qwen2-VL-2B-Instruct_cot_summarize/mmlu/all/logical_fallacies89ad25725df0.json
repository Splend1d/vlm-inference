A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument where the conclusion is a disjunction (or) of two premises. The statement essentially states that for a disjunctive syllogism to be valid, the minor premise must either support the antecedent or contradict the consequent.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. A disjunctive syllogism: This is correct because a disjunctive syllogism requires that the minor premise either agree with the antecedent or disagree with the consequent.\n\nB. A categorical syllogism: This is incorrect because a categorical syllogism requires that the minor premise either support the antecedent or contradict the consequent, not agree with both.\n\nC. A conditional syllogism: This is incorrect because a conditional syllogism requires that the minor premise either support the consequent or contradict the antecedent, not agree with both.\n\nD. Disjunctive enthymeme: This is incorrect because an enthymeme is a type of logical argument where the conclusion is a disjunction (or) of two premises, not a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. a disjunctive syllogism"
