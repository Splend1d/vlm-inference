She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Recommend behavioral therapy\nB. Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy\nC. Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem\nD. Review the patient's sexual history\n"

Review the patient's sexual history\n\nGiven the patient's history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels, and the fact that the symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and stop the day after she arrives at her destination, it is likely that the patient is experiencing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). This condition is characterized by increased frequency of urination and incontinence, which can be exacerbated by stress and anxiety.\n\nReviewing the patient's sexual history is the most appropriate next step to determine if there is a connection between her symptoms and her sexual activity. This can help identify if there are any specific behaviors or circumstances that exacerbate her symptoms, which could be addressed through lifestyle modifications or counseling.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is to review the patient's sexual history."
