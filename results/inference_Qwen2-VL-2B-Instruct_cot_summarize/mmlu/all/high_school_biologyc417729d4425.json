                    "text": "A. Lake B is alkaline.\n\nThe pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity. A pH of 8.0 is considered alkaline, meaning the solution is more basic than water (pH 7.0). A pH of 6.0 is considered acidic, meaning the solution is more acidic than water (pH 7.0). Therefore, Lake B is more acidic than Lake A, making it alkaline. \n\nB. Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A.\n\nThe pH of a solution is not directly proportional to the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+ ions). The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that a 100-fold increase in hydrogen ions results in a 10-fold decrease in pH. Therefore, Lake B is not 100 times more alkaline than Lake A.\n\nC. The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 104 M.\n\nThe hydrogen ion concentration (H+) in a solution is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{H+ concentration} = 10^{-\\text{pH}} \\]\n\nFor Lake B with a pH of 6.0, the hydrogen ion concentration is:\n\n\\[ \\text{H+ concentration} = 10^{-6} \\]\n\nFor Lake A with a pH of 8.0, the hydrogen ion concentration is:\n\n\\[ \\text{H+ concentration} = 10^{-8} \\]\n\nThe hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 100 times less than that of Lake A, not 104 M.\n\nD. The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain.\n\nAcid rain, which contains sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can react with water to form sulfuric and nitric acids, respectively. These acids can react with water to form hydrogen ions, making the solution more acidic. Therefore, both lakes will become more acidic in response to acid rain.\n\nThe correct answer is A."
