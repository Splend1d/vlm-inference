While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.\nB. The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.\nC. The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.\nD. The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.\n"

The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Insured Value vs. Market Value**: The painting was insured for $1,000,000, which is a significant amount compared to its market value of over $1,500,000. This indicates that the painting was valuable and had a high market potential.\n\n2. **Consideration**: The detective's request for the $50,000 was based on the woman's promise to pay him for recovering the painting. Since the painting's market value was significantly higher than its insured value, the detective had a strong basis for believing that the promise was reasonable and that the woman had the financial means to fulfill it.\n\n3. **Gratuitous Offer**: The woman's promise was not gratuitous. She was offering to pay the detective a substantial amount for a service that was valuable to her, and the detective was willing to accept it.\n\n4. **Acceptance**: The detective's acceptance of the woman's offer was necessary for the promise to be considered valid. The detective's request for the money was a clear indication that he accepted the offer.\n\nGiven these points, the detective is most likely to prevail because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, making the promise reasonable and the detective's request for payment a valid acceptance of the offer."
