This is because the marginal benefit is the additional benefit received from consuming one more unit of the good, and the marginal cost is the additional cost incurred by consuming one more unit of the good. If the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost, then consuming the next cookie will increase the consumer's total benefit. If the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost, then consuming the next cookie will neither increase nor decrease the consumer's total benefit. If the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost, then consuming the next cookie will decrease the consumer's total benefit. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
