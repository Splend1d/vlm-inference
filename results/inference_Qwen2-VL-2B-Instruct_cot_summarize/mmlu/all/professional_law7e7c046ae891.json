A group of students painted purple a statue of the university's founder in protest to the university's federally subsidized nuclear weapon experimental studies. The leader of this group of students was a first-year student from a neighboring state who established residency in the state after beginning classes. The group leader had been the recipient of a $5,000 annual grant from the state to finance his education. However, the aid was withdrawn because of a state statute, which provided: \"Any student attending a state university who engages in disruptive campus activities will not be eligible for state aid. \"The group leader was married to a fellow student. However, in light of his involvement in defacing the statue and the loss of his state aid, his wife left him. At that time, the group leader received a tax bill for $150. This tax was imposed uniformly by the city on all individuals over 19 years of age, with the exception that full-time female college students were exempted. The tax notice stated that his wife, 22 years of age, qualified for the exemption, and there was no bill enclosed for her. Subsequently, the group leader moved in with his new girlfriend and began making arrangements to secure a divorce. However, the group leader was not able to obtain a divorce, since he had not fulfilled the 12-month residency requirement as imposed by state law. In an action by the group leader against the state challenging the constitutionality of the state statute regarding disruptive campus activities in order to regain his $5,000 annual grant, the court will most likely declare the statute\n\nA. constitutional, because it promotes a compelling state interest.\nB. constitutional, because it is a proper exercise of state action designed to regulate the activities of state university students.\nC. unconstitutional, because it is vague and overbroad.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is discriminatory on its face.\n"

The statute in question is intended to regulate disruptive campus activities, but it is too broad and vague to be narrowly tailored to achieve its intended purpose. This is a common issue in constitutional law, where the court will typically find that a statute is unconstitutional if it is overbroad or vague.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. unconstitutional, because it is vague and overbroad."
