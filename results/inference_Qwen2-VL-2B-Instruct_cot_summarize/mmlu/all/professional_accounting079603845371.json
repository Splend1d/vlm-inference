A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied with the completed result.\n\nIn this scenario, Toby was not satisfied with the completed result of the hair styling, which is a substantial performance. The dissatisfaction is due to the fact that Toby was in good faith, meaning he had reasonable grounds to believe the work was satisfactory. Therefore, the doctrine of substantial performance applies here."
