Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized.\n\nCase studies are a type of qualitative research that involves examining a single case or a small group of cases in depth to understand the phenomenon of interest. They are not based on the assumption that the case can be generalized. Instead, case studies are designed to provide a detailed examination of a single case or a small group of cases to understand the phenomenon of interest. This allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon and to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent in larger samples."
