This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the shells of gastropods, which are marine organisms, show a decrease in oxygen isotope ratios, indicating a shift towards drier conditions. This shift is consistent with the historical record of the Indus Valley civilization, which experienced a series of catastrophic floods and a decline in population and economic activity. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. It collapsed due to increased monsoons and a series of catastrophic floods."
