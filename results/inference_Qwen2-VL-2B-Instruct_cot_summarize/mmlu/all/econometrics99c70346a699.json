In this model, the mean component is estimated using a linear regression of the daily corporate bond percentage returns on a set of explanatory variables. The value of the GARCH-in-mean parameter estimate will depend on the specific variables included in the regression and the estimated coefficients.\n\nWithout knowing the specific variables included in the regression and the estimated coefficients, it is not possible to determine the exact value of the GARCH-in-mean parameter estimate. However, we can say that the value of the parameter estimate will be between -1 and 0, as the mean component of the model is estimated using a linear regression of the returns on a set of explanatory variables, which can result in a positive or negative slope depending on the sign of the coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Between -1 and 0."
