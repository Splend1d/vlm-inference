Because of this increased work load, the Court has complained that it is unable to properly review all of its cases. As a consequence, Congress formed a committee to conduct a study on improving the functioning and operation of the Court. Based on the committee's recommendations, Congress enacted a statute dividing the Court into two panels. One panel would be assigned to handle criminal cases exclusively, while the other panel would handle all non-criminal matters. Each panel would be composed of four associate justices and a chief justice. According to the new law, the decisions of each panel would be final and not reviewable by any other court or judiciary. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute?\n\nA. The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.\nB. The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.\nC. Based on the doctrine ofjudicial supremacy, Congress does not have authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\nD. Based on the separate sovereignty doctrine, Congress does not have authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which argument is the strongest against the constitutionality of the federal statute, we need to analyze the context and the core of the question. The statute divides the U.S. Supreme Court into two panels, with each panel handling criminal and non-criminal cases respectively. The key issue is whether this division violates the requirement that there be one Supreme Court and whether it is necessary and proper for the effectuation of the enumerated powers of Congress.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.\n- This option suggests that the statute violates the requirement that there be a single Supreme Court. However, the statute does not violate this requirement; it simply divides the Court into two panels.\n\nB. The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.\n- This option argues that the statute is not within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary for the effectuation of those powers. However, the statute is within the enumerated powers of Congress (the powers of the federal government) and is necessary for the effectuation of those powers.\n\nC. Based on the doctrine of judicial supremacy, Congress does not have authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\n- This option suggests that Congress lacks authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, the statute does not violate judicial supremacy; it merely divides the Court.\n\nD. Based on the separate sovereignty doctrine, Congress does not have authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court.\n- This option argues that Congress lacks authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court. However, the statute does not violate the separate sovereignty doctrine; it simply divides the Court.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the strongest argument against the constitutionality of the statute is:\n\nB. The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.\n\nFinal answer: B."
