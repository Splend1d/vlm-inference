The prosecution cannot introduce evidence of the man's past crimes to prove his disposition to commit the crime in question. This is because the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the prosecution cannot introduce evidence of the defendant's past behavior to prove his guilt."
