Birds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance.\n\nThis observation helped Darwin shape his concept of descent with modification by showing that species can evolve over long periods of time through a process of natural selection, even when they are isolated from other species. It suggests that the diversity of species on islands is not due to a lack of diversity on the mainland but rather due to the isolation of species from each other and their ability to adapt and evolve."
