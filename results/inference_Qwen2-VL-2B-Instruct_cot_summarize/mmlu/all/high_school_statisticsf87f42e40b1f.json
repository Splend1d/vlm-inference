The analysis will include a significance test with H0: Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease. Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error?\n\nA. Patients will spend more money on Heartaid, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nB. Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nC. Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\nD. Researchers will calculate the wrong P-value, making their advice to doctors invalid.\n"

In this context, if the researchers fail to reject the null hypothesis that Heartaid is equally effective as the current medication, they will conclude that Heartaid is not more effective. This means that doctors will continue to prescribe the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective."
