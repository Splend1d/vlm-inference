This means that the estate would be divided in the ratio of 1:1, or 50% to each.\n\nHowever, Mary's will was executed on May 15, 1990, and she died on August 18, 1990. This means that the will was not in effect when she died. Therefore, the will is not binding and cannot be enforced.\n\nThe will is not enforceable because it was executed before Mary's death. The will is not binding because it was not in effect when Mary died.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army."
