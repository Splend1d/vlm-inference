Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.\n- This option suggests that the success of the upper classes was justified by cultural and intellectual arguments. However, Sumner's ideas do not focus on cultural and intellectual justifications but rather on the survival of the fittest and the selection of the best individuals.\n\nB. Popular writers rejected ideas from the sciences, and based their arguments on faith.\n- This option implies that popular writers rejected scientific ideas and instead relied on faith. Sumner's ideas do not involve rejection of scientific ideas but rather the selection of the best individuals based on natural selection.\n\nC. Intellectuals were critical of the cut-throat competition of the ages, and proposed radical alternatives based on creating a cooperative economy.\n- This option suggests that intellectuals were critical of the competitive nature of the era and proposed cooperative alternatives. Sumner's ideas do not focus on radical alternatives but rather on the survival of the fittest and the selection of the best individuals.\n\nD. Cultural products of the era tended to ignore the economic direction of society and looked back wistfully to the past.\n- This option suggests that cultural products of the era ignored the economic direction and looked back to the past. Sumner's ideas do not focus on cultural products but rather on the survival of the fittest and the selection of the best individuals.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option A aligns most closely with the sociological ideas of William Graham Sumner, which reflect the idea that during the late 1800s, cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nA. Cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable."
