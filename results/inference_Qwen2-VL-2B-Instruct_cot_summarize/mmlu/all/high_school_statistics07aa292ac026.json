This principle helps us to avoid double-counting the customers who request both services.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( O \\) as the event that a customer requests an oil change.\n- \\( R \\) as the event that a customer requests a tire replacement.\n\nWe are given:\n- \\( P(O) = 0.60 \\) (probability of requesting an oil change)\n- \\( P(R) = 0.30 \\) (probability of requesting a tire replacement)\n- \\( P(O \\cap R) = 0.10 \\) (probability of requesting both services)\n\nWe want to find \\( P(O \\cap R^c) \\), which is the probability of a customer requesting an oil change but not a tire replacement. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n\\[ P(O \\cap R^c) = P(O) - P(O \\cap R) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ P(O \\cap R^c) = 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a customer requests an oil change and does not request tire replacements is \\( 0.50 \\), which corresponds to option B."
