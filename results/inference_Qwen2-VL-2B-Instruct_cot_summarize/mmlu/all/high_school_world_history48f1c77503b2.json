The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich statement most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire?\n\nA. Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.\nB. The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works.\nC. Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women.\nD. The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion.\n"

The Mongol khans did not invest in building large-scale monuments; instead, they focused on military conquest and expansion. The Persian kings, on the other hand, were known for their public works, such as the construction of the Great Wall of China.\n\n3. **Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women.**\n   - This statement is false. The Persian kings did not improve the social, economic, and legal status of women; instead, they maintained a traditional gender hierarchy.\n\n4. **The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion.**\n   - This statement is false. The Mongols did not create a new syncretic belief system; instead, they maintained a traditional Mongol belief system that combined elements of Buddhism and Islam. The Persians, however, maintained a traditional monotheistic religion, which was based on the worship of a single deity.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire is:\n\n**A. Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.**"
