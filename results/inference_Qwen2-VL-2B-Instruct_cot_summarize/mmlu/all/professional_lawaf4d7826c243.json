When the driver could not produce a driver's license, the officer asked him if he minded if they searched the vehicle. The officer did not advise the driver that he had a right to refuse consent or that if he refused his decision would be honored, but there was nothing duplicitous or coercive in the officer's conduct. The driver smiled and said \"of course, no problem.\" The officer found stolen bank checks under the rear seat. In a later suppression motion, the driver claimed that his consent was not voluntary. What will the court most likely decide on that issue?\n\nA. The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.\nB. The consent was involuntary because it was the product of implied duress.\nC. The consent was involuntary because the officer did not advise the driver of his right to refuse.\nD. The consent became voluntary as a matter of law when the driver failed to produce a driver's license.\n"

The officer did not advise the driver of his right to refuse consent or that if he refused his decision would be honored. This is a standard practice in law enforcement, and it does not imply coercion or duress.\n\n2. The driver smiled and said \"of course, no problem.\" This indicates that the driver was willing to cooperate with the officer's request.\n\n3. The officer found stolen bank checks under the rear seat. This is a common practice in law enforcement to ensure that the driver is cooperative and willing to cooperate with the investigation.\n\n4. The court will likely find that the officer's actions were reasonable and necessary to protect public safety and investigate the stolen bank checks.\n\nTherefore, the court will most likely decide that the consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress."
