R-sq represents the proportion of the variance in the response variable that is predictable from the explanatory variable.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce the following:\n\n- R-sq = 98.1% means that about 98.1% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.\n- This implies that the relationship between the explanatory and response variables is strong, as a high R-sq value indicates a strong linear relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
