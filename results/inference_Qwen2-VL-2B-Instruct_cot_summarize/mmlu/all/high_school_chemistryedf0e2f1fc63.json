Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point.\n\nThis is because a weak base is titrated with a strong acid, which results in a rapid decrease in pH due to the formation of a weak acid (ammonium ion) and a conjugate base (hydroxide ion). The pH decreases rapidly until the equivalence point is reached, where the concentration of the weak base is equal to the concentration of the strong acid, and the reaction is balanced."
