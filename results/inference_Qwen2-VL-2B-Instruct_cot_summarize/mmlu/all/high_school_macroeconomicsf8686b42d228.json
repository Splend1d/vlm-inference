The government increases spending with no increase in taxes.\n\nWhen the government increases spending without increasing taxes, it is likely to stimulate economic activity and increase real GDP. This is because increased spending can lead to higher demand for goods and services, which can boost production and employment. On the other hand, if the government decreases spending while maintaining the same level of taxes, it can lead to a decrease in real GDP, as the reduction in spending may not be offset by an equal increase in taxes."
