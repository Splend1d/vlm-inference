BB BB - This represents two brown fur alleles (BB) from both parents. Since both parents have brown fur, their offspring will also have brown fur. This does not produce offspring with silver fur.\n\nB. BB Bb - This represents a brown fur allele (B) from one parent and a silver fur allele (b) from the other parent. The offspring will have brown fur (B) from both parents, but they will also have silver fur (b) from one parent. This does not produce offspring with silver fur.\n\nC. Bb Bb - This represents a brown fur allele (B) from one parent and a silver fur allele (b) from the other parent. The offspring will have brown fur (B) from both parents, but they will also have silver fur (b) from one parent. This does not produce offspring with silver fur.\n\nD. Bb bb - This represents a brown fur allele (B) from one parent and a silver fur allele (b) from the other parent. The offspring will have brown fur (B) from both parents, but they will also have silver fur (b) from one parent. This does produce offspring with silver fur (bb) from parents that both have brown fur (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Bb bb."
