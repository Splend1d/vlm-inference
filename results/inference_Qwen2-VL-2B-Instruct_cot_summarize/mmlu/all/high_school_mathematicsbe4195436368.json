However, for the purpose of this problem, we can use a numerical method or graphing software to find the roots of the equation.\n\nUpon solving the equation numerically, we find that the roots are approximately at \\( t \\approx 0.74 \\) and \\( t \\approx 2.74 \\).\n\nThese roots correspond to the points where the velocity changes from positive to negative or vice versa. Therefore, the object reverses direction at these two points.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nC. two"
