The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\nB. Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.\nC. Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.\nD. Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.\n"

Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Common Law Principle**: The retiree owned the building and had the right to collect rent from the artist. The artist entered into a lease agreement with the retiree, which was valid and binding.\n\n2. **Termination of Lease**: The original three-year term of the lease had expired, but the artist continued to pay rent. This indicates that the lease was not terminated by the retiree.\n\n3. **Infection of the Building**: The building became infested with rats due to the adjacent restaurant. This is a new and unforeseen event that caused the artist to leave the premises.\n\n4. **Notice and Notice Period**: The artist served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. This notice was given after the artist had been on the premises for a period beyond the three-year term.\n\n5. **Prorated Rent**: The retiree could recover double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period. This is because the artist was on the premises for more than the original three-year term.\n\nTherefore, the correct remedy available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period was to recover double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period."
