We can use the information given to calculate it:\n\nNet Income = (Return on Assets * Asset Turnover) * Sales\n\nWe know that Gamma's return on assets is 10% and its asset turnover is 4:1, which means it turns over its assets 4 times in a year. So, we can calculate the net income as follows:\n\nNet Income = (0.10 * 4) * Sales\nNet Income = 0.40 * Sales\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for Net Income into the profit margin formula:\n\nProfit Margin on Sales = (0.40 * Sales) / Sales * 100%\nProfit Margin on Sales = 0.40 * 100%\nProfit Margin on Sales = 40.00%\n\nTherefore, Gamma's profit margin on sales is 40.00%, which corresponds to option A."
