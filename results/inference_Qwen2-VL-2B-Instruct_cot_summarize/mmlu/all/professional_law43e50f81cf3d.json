The contract stated:\"The painting is to be done during the month of June, and payment is to be made within one week after the painting is completed. The rights under this contact are not to be assigned. \"The painter started the painting on June 1. On June 10, the painter assigned to his nephew the right to receive payment on the painter's contract with the homeowner. Which of the following statements is most accurate with regard to the painter's assignment to his nephew?\n\nA. The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.\nB. Since personal service contracts of this nature are nonassignable, the homeowner would be under no duty to pay the nephew.\nC. The assignment would constitute a novation, relieving the homeowner of liability.\nD. The assignment would be irrevocable if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter.\n"

The assignment would be irrevocable if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nonassignability**: The contract states that the rights under the contract are not to be assigned. This means that the homeowner cannot assign the right to receive payment to the painter's nephew.\n\n2. **Assignment**: The painter assigned the right to receive payment to his nephew. This is a form of assignment, which means the right to receive payment is transferred from the painter to the nephew.\n\n3. **Irrevocability**: An assignment is considered irrevocable if it is reduced to writing and signed by the painter. This means that the assignment cannot be rescinded or revoked by either party.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the assignment would be irrevocable if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter."
