Five years ago, the older computer was half as fast as the current computer, so \\(S_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{1}{2}S_{\\text{new}}\\).\n2. Five years ago, the older computer was twice as expensive as the current computer, so \\(P_{\\text{old}} = 2P_{\\text{new}}\\).\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the speeds to prices of the current computer to the older computer, which is \\(\\frac{S_{\\text{new}}}{P_{\\text{new}}} : \\frac{S_{\\text{old}}}{P_{\\text{old}}}\\).\n\nFrom the relationships above, we can express \\(S_{\\text{old}}\\) and \\(P_{\\text{old}}\\) in terms of \\(S_{\\text{new}}\\) and \\(P_{\\text{new}}\\):\n- \\(S_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{1}{2}S_{\\text{new}}\\)\n- \\(P_{\\text{old}} = 2P_{\\text{new}}\\)\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{S_{\\text{new}}}{P_{\\text{new}}} : \\frac{S_{\\text{old}}}{P_{\\text{old}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(S_{\\text{old}}\\) and \\(P_{\\text{old}}\\) with their expressions in terms of \\(S_{\\text{new}}\\) and \\(P_{\\text{new}}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{S_{\\text{new}}}{P_{\\text{new}}} : \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}S_{\\text{new}}}{2P_{\\text{new}}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{S_{\\text{new}}}{P_{\\text{new}}} : \\frac{S_{\\text{new}}}{4P_{\\text{new}}}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} : \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the speeds to prices is therefore:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} : \\frac{1}{4} = 1 : 1\n\\]\n\nThis means the ratio of the speeds to prices is the same as the ratio of the prices to speeds, which is 1:1. This means the ratio of the speeds to prices is the same as the ratio of the prices to speeds, which is 1:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)"
