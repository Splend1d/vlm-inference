This is a common observation in the field of computer vision and machine learning.\n\nStatement 2 is False, as ensembles of neural networks can indeed improve classification accuracy. The correlation between the representations learned by individual neural networks can be high, but ensembles can often achieve better performance by leveraging the strengths of individual models.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
