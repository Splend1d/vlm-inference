The parasympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the sympathetic responses.\n\nWhen a child is frightened by a sudden barking of a neighbor's dog, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, which is responsible for the fight-or-flight response. This response is characterized by increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and increased muscle tension. When the child is picked up by her mother, the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the relaxation response, resumes control. This allows the child to calm down and return to a more relaxed state."
