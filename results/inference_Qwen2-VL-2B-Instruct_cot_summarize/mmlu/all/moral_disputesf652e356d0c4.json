Self-evident propositions are those that are true by definition and do not require proof. The statement \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us\" is not a proposition that is universally true by definition, but rather a statement that is true by the nature of the light and the human perception of it. Therefore, it is not an example of a self-evident proposition."
