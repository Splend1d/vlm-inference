The demand is inelastic and the supply is inelastic\n\nWhen a good is taxed, the tax burden falls mainly on the consumer if the demand for the good is inelastic and the supply is also inelastic. In such cases, the price of the good remains relatively stable, and the consumer's demand for the good is not responsive to changes in the price. This means that the consumer is not willing to pay more for the good, and the tax burden falls mainly on the consumer."
