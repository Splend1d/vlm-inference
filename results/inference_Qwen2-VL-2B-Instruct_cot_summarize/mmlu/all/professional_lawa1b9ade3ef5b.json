After the daughter married, she and her husband lived on the farm in a small cottage. From 1985 to 1989, the daughter and the husband helped the widower farm and maintain the property. The widower, whose health was deteriorating, needed the services of the daughter and her husband in order to continue to live on the farm. In December 1989, the daughter told the widower that she and her husband were planning to move out of state. Worried that he could not survive without their help, the widower said to the daughter, \"Please don't ever leav. e. I'm totally dependent on you and your husband. If you stay and continue to care for me and help with the farming, the farm will be yours when I die. \" The daughter turned down a job offer in a neighboring state and decided to do as the widower requested. For nine years, the daughter cared for her father while her husband handled most of the farming operations. In 1998, the widower died intestate with the daughter and the son as his only surviving heirs. The period required to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is seven years. In an appropriate action to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son, respectively, in the farm, the result will depend upon the application of the principles of and exceptions to the\n\nA. statute of frauds.\nB. parol evidence rule.\nC. law for adverse possession.\nD. doctrine of resulting trusts.\n"

In this case, the daughter and her husband had continuous possession of the farm for nine years without the widower's consent. Therefore, the daughter and her husband have acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.\n\nThe other options are not relevant to this situation:\n\nA. Statute of frauds: This would apply if the daughter and her husband were not legally able to enter into a contract with the widower, but in this case, they did enter into a contract.\nB. Parol evidence rule: This would apply if the daughter and her husband were not required to reveal any prior agreements or understandings that would affect the title to the farm.\nD. Doctrine of resulting trusts: This would apply if the daughter and her husband had a legal obligation to care for the widower, but the title to the farm was not transferred to them until the end of the seven-year period."
