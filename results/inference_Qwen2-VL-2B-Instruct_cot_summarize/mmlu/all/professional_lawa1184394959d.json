Convicted, because intent to commit serious bodily harm is assumed when a deadly weapon is used.\n\nFirst-degree murder is a criminal offense that involves the intentional killing of another person. The law typically requires the defendant to have a specific intent to cause death, such as the intent to kill or the intent to cause serious bodily harm. In this case, Max used a deadly weapon (a gun) to kill a customer, which is a clear example of the use of a deadly weapon. The law assumes that the defendant had the intent to cause serious bodily harm when a deadly weapon is used, even if the defendant did not specifically intend to kill. Therefore, Max is likely to be convicted of first-degree murder."
