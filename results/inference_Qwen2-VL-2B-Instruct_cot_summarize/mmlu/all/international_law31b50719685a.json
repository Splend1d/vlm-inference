No, even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts.\n\nThe peremptory norms of international law are the fundamental principles and rules that are binding on all states, regardless of their nationality or status. These norms are set out in the United Nations Charter and other international instruments. However, it is important to note that not all peremptory norms are equally binding. Some may be subject to exceptions or reservations, and some may be subject to derogations or limitations. Additionally, some peremptory norms may be subject to interpretation and application by the international community, rather than being absolute obligations."
