According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is generally considered morally wrong to go to a public pool in a swimsuit without a swimsuit cover, as it is considered inappropriate and disrespectful to others. Therefore, scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character left their trash after the picnic in the park. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is generally considered morally wrong to leave trash in public places, as it can be a sign of poor personal hygiene and lack of consideration for others. Therefore, scenario 2 is also morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
