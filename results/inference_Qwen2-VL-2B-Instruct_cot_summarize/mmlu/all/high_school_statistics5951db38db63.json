It is noted that 25 players who claim to study the most hours have a higher point average than the 25 players who study less. This suggests a possible relationship between the amount of study time and point scoring.\n\n**Option A: While this study may have its faults, it still does prove causation.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the study does not prove causation. It only shows a correlation between study time and point average. The study does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n**Option B: There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The study does not account for other variables that might influence point scoring, such as physical fitness, mental focus, or other factors that could affect both study time and point average. Confounding variables can make it difficult to determine the true cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n**Option C: While this is a controlled experiment, the conclusion of the coach is not justified.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The study is a controlled experiment, meaning that the conditions are controlled and the results are interpretable. The coach's conclusion is justified based on the observed correlation.\n\n**Option D: To get the athletes to study more, it would be more meaningful to have them put in more practice time on the court to boost their point averages, as higher point averages seem to be associated with more study time.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While it is true that higher point averages are associated with more study time, the study does not provide evidence that practice time alone would lead to higher point averages. The study only shows a correlation between study time and point average, not causation.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.**"
