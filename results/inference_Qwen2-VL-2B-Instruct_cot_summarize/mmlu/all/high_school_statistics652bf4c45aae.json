If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\n- This statement suggests that increasing control over the situation would lead to higher job satisfaction. The correlation of 0.30 indicates a weak positive relationship, but it does not necessarily imply causation. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nB.

Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\n- This statement suggests that higher job satisfaction is associated with lower self-efficacy. The correlation of 0.30 indicates a weak positive relationship, but it does not necessarily imply causation. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n- This statement suggests that self-efficacy is a significant predictor of job satisfaction. The correlation of 0.30 indicates a weak positive relationship, but it does not necessarily imply causation. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that follows from the correlation of 0.30 is:\n\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n\nFinal answer: D."
