The impact will be positive, because drier weather will mean less habitat for malaria mosquitoes, so fewer workers will be sick at harvest time.\nC. The impact will be positive because there will be more carbon dioxide available for plant photosynthesis.\nD. There currently is no scientific consensus as to whether climate change is occurring or whether it will over the next 50 years.\n"
