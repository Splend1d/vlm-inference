The block reaches the bottom of the ramp first.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The sphere rolls down the inclined plane without slipping, meaning it does not lose any rotational kinetic energy. Therefore, it gains rotational kinetic energy as it rolls down the plane.\n- The block slides down the plane without friction, meaning it does not lose any translational kinetic energy. Therefore, it gains translational kinetic energy as it slides down the plane.\n\nSince the sphere gains rotational kinetic energy and the block gains translational kinetic energy, the block will reach the bottom of the ramp first."
