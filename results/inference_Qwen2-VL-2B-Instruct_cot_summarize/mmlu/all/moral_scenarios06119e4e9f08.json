However, it is important to note that the context and the circumstances of the kiss can significantly impact the moral judgment. If the kiss is consensual and not against the wishes of the other person, it might be considered a private and innocent act. However, if the kiss is forced or against the wishes of the other person, it could be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is rushing their grandfather to the hospital when he has a heart attack. This action is generally considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020. Rushing a person to the hospital in an emergency situation can be seen as a violation of the patient's right to receive timely medical care and can lead to serious harm or death.\n\nTherefore, the main character's actions in scenario 2 are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
