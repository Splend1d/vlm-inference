Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P. Hopkins, eds. Corpus of Early\nArabic Sources for West African History. Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1981.

Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.\nB. Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine which option best reflects the assertion about the kingdom of Mali, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage discusses the wealth of the kingdom of Mali, particularly focusing on the copper mine and the gold extracted from it. It mentions that the gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and that the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **A. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals**: This option aligns well with the passage, which describes the gold extracted from the copper mine as being the primary source of wealth for the kingdom.\n   - **B. Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors**: The passage does not mention any conquests or the presence of pagan neighbors, so this option is not supported by the information provided.\n   - **C. Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates**: The passage does not discuss large agricultural estates, so this option is not supported by the information.\n   - **D. Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade**: The passage does not mention any slave trade, so this option is not supported by the information.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The passage clearly states that the gold extracted from the copper mine is the primary source of wealth for the kingdom of Mali. Therefore, the most accurate reflection of the kingdom's wealth comes from the exploitation of minerals.\n\n**Final Answer**: A. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals."
