However, the character's actions are not aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as they are focused on personal appearance and not on the well-being or rights of others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is using \"I\" to describe their actions of finding and returning a lost award, which is generally considered morally acceptable. The character's actions are aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as they are focused on returning a lost item to its rightful owner.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
