There are $\\frac{100}{2} = 50$ such numbers.\n\nThe integers in the set $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,100\\}$ that are not divisible by 3 are the numbers that are not multiples of 3. The multiples of 3 in the set are $3, 6, 9, \\ldots, 99$. There are $\\frac{99}{3} = 33$ such numbers.\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected integer in the set $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,100\\}$ is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. The number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the number of even numbers and the number of multiples of 3, which is $50 + 33 = 83$. The total number of outcomes is the total number of integers in the set, which is $100$. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{83}{100} = \\frac{17}{31}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{31}}$."
