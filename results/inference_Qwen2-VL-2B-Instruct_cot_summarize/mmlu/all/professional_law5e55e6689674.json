This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n"

This tax is crucial to the state's economy. Congress has enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on pitchblende. This federal law affects only the state, as pitchblende is not mined in any other state.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\"\n     - This option suggests that the federal law is invalid because it conflicts with the supremacy clause, which grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, the federal law does not interfere with interstate commerce; it only affects the state.\n   - **Option B**: \"invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\"\n     - This option suggests that the federal law is invalid because it interferes with the general welfare of the nation. However, the federal law does not interfere with the general welfare of the nation; it only affects the state.\n   - **Option C**: \"valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\"\n     - This option suggests that the federal law is valid because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the state's taxing policies. However, the federal law does not interfere with the state's taxing policies; it only affects the state.\n   - **Option D**: \"valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\"\n     - This option suggests that the federal law is valid because it does not place one state on an unequal footing with other states. However, the federal law does not place one state on an unequal footing with other states; it only affects the state.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**Final Answer: Option C. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.**"
