This perspective acknowledges that both forms of speech target subsets of women and that they are part of a larger spectrum of oppression that includes other forms of discrimination and inequality. By viewing misogynistic speech as part of a broader spectrum of oppression, we can better understand the impact and significance of such speech and work towards addressing it more effectively."
