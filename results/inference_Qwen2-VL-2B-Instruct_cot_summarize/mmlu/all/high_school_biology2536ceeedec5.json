Increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane\n\nIncreasing the concentration gradient of a solute across the plasma membrane of a cell will increase the rate of diffusion of the solute across the membrane. This is because the concentration gradient provides a driving force for the movement of solutes across the membrane, and the higher the concentration gradient, the greater the rate of diffusion."
