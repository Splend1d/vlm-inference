C. training, the student was required to spend three weeks at a camp for Marine Corps. summer field exercises. While at the camp, the student was given a new synthetic helmet to wear during her basic training. An agency purchased the new high-technology helmets for the Army and Marine Corps. to replace the old \"steel pot\" headgear worn for decades by U. S. soldiers. These new synthetic helmets were manufactured by a corporation and were made of Kevlar, an extremely tough fiber material with high energy-absorbing qualities that made it stronger in some ways than steel. When the student received her helmet from the Marine Corps. , it was packaged in the original carton supplied by the corporation. On the box, there was a picture that depicted an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. One afternoon after training, the student decided to take a ride on her bicycle. Believing that it could be used as a bicycle helmet, the student decided to use it for that purpose. During the ride, the student hit a deep pothole that caused her to be thrown headfirst from the bicycle. As she was flying through the air, the strap from her helmet came loose, and the helmet fell off her head. The student landed on a lawn and was temporarily knocked unconscious. She suffered serious head injuries. If the student asserts a claim against the corporation to recover damages for her injuries, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur negligence can be inferred from the fact that the helmet came off the student's head.\nB. prevail, because the original package depicted a picture of a cyclist wearing the helmet.\nC. not prevail, because the student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\nD. not prevail, because the helmet had been properly designed by the corporation for its intended use by the Army and Marine Corps.\n"

Not prevail, because the student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Res Ipsa Loquitur**: This principle states that if an object falls on a person and causes injury, the person is presumed to have been negligent. However, in this case, the student was not negligent. The helmet fell off her head due to an accident, not because she was negligent.\n\n2. **Original Package**: The original package depicted a picture of a cyclist wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. This does not establish that the helmet was intended for use as a bicycle helmet.\n\n3. **Intended Use**: The helmet was intended for use by the Marine Corps, not by the student. The student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\n\n4. **Design**: The helmet was designed for use by the Army and Marine Corps, not by the student. The corporation had a responsibility to ensure that the helmet was suitable for its intended use.\n\nTherefore, the student's injury was not caused by negligence, and the corporation is not liable for damages."
