It is generally considered unethical to witness a car accident and not take action to help the injured parties or to report it to the authorities.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character sets the baby down after finishing feeding it. This action is generally considered morally right. Feeding a baby is a natural and necessary part of caring for them, and it is generally considered acceptable to do so without any moral qualms."
