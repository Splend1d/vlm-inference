According to the mother, the man told her, \"Don't worry, my insurance company will pay for all of your son's medical expenses. \"If offered into evidence, the court will most likely rule that the mother's statement is\n\nA. admissible, on the issue of the defendant's negligence.\nB. admissible, to show that the defendant is able to pay for the medical expenses.\nC. inadmissible, because the testimony was highly prejudicial.\nD. admissible, only to prove ownership or control of the motorcycle.\n"

The mother's statement is not relevant to the issue of negligence or the defendant's ability to pay for medical expenses. It is more likely to be considered highly prejudicial and therefore inadmissible."
