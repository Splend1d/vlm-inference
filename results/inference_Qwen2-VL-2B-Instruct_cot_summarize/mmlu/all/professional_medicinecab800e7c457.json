He\u00a0says that he has been constipated for the past 5\u00a0days and denies hematochezia and melena. He\u00a0says that he usually has loose stools during final exam week. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination\u00a0reveals mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, and the remainder of the findings are normal. Where does the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originate?\n\nA. C1-C2\nB. T1-T4\nC. T7-L2\nD. L3-L5\n"

The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for regulating blood pressure, heart rate, and other autonomic functions. In the abdominal region, the sympathetic innervation is primarily located in the thoracic and abdominal regions, with the most prominent innervation being in the thoracic region.\n\nTherefore, the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originates in the T1-T4 region.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB.
