It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.\n\nA. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\nB. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.\nC. No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.\nD. No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.\n"

The common law definition of defamation includes the elements of publication, malice, and damage to the reputation of the defendant. In this case, the competitor's letter was addressed to the manager, which is a form of publication. The language in the letter was defamatory, which is a form of malice. The letter also caused damage to the manager's reputation, which is a form of damage. Therefore, the court will likely find that all of the elements of defamation are present and dismiss the defendant's motion to dismiss."
