It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.\n\nFloating-point arithmetic is inherently nonassociative because it is based on the idea of floating-point numbers, which are represented as a combination of an exponent and a mantissa. The exponent is a fixed number of bits, and the mantissa is a variable-length number that can represent a wide range of values. The nonassociativity arises from the fact that the exponent and mantissa are not independent; they are related through the exponentiation operation. This relationship means that the order in which the exponent and mantissa are processed can affect the result, which is why floating-point arithmetic is inherently nonassociative."
