The woman, who was seriously injured in the accident, sued the motorboat operator in a personal injury action. During the course of the lawsuit, an important question of consequence was the wind speed on the afternoon the woman was sailing. At trial, the woman calls an orthopedic surgeon to testi1'. The surgeon, who is an amateur boating enthusiast, testified that he was navigating his sailboat into the bay when the motorboat hit the woman. Furthermore, the surgeon testified that in the cockpit of his boat he maintains a sophisticated electronic weathering device that measures wind speed, temperature, and barometric pressure at periodic intervals. The woman then offers into evidence the computer printout from the surgeon's weathering device measuring the wind speed at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the motorboat operator, the printout is\n\nA. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nB. admissible as the record of regularly conducted activity.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, unless there is foundation testimony as to the accuracy and good working condition of the surgeon's electronic weathering device on the afternoon in question.\n"

Inadmissible, unless there is foundation testimony as to the accuracy and good working condition of the surgeon's electronic weathering device on the afternoon in question.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Evidence**: The woman's claim is based on the wind speed at the time of the accident, which is a critical factor in determining the severity of the injury. The wind speed is a measurable physical quantity that can be objectively measured and recorded.\n\n2. **Purpose of the Evidence**: The purpose of the evidence is to establish the wind speed at the time of the accident, which is relevant to the woman's injury. The wind speed is a fact that can be objectively measured and recorded.\n\n3. **Admissibility**: The evidence of the wind speed is admissible as a fact in a personal injury action. The admissibility is based on the fact that the wind speed is a measurable physical quantity that can be objectively recorded and measured.\n\n4. **Foundation**: The foundation for the admissibility of the evidence is the accuracy and good working condition of the surgeon's electronic weathering device. The motorboat operator must show that the device was accurate and functioning properly on the afternoon in question.\n\n5. **Inadmissibility**: The evidence is inadmissible unless there is foundation testimony as to the accuracy and good working condition of the device. This is because the wind speed is a fact that can be objectively measured and recorded, and the motorboat operator must establish that the device was accurate and functioning properly on the afternoon in question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Inadmissible, unless there is foundation testimony as to the accuracy and good working condition of the surgeon's electronic weathering device on the afternoon in question."
