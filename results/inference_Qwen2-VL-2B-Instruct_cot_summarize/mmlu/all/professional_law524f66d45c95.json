Just ahead, the pedestrian noticed a private dinner club. As the pedestrian approached the club, he noticed a sign over the front door that read: \"ADMITTANCE TO MEMBERS ONLY. \" Although the pedestrian was not a member of the exclusive club, he entered the dimly lit club, found a door marked \"Gentlemen,\" and entered the restroom. Which of the following would best describe the pedestrian's legal status when he was in the restroom?\n\nA. Trespasser.\nB. Guest.\nC. Licensee.\nD. Invitee.\n"

Invitee.\n\nThis is because the pedestrian entered the restroom without the intention of becoming a member of the club, and the club's sign clearly states that it is for members only. The pedestrian's entry was not a result of a contract or agreement to become a member, nor was it a result of the club's invitation to enter. Therefore, he was not a trespasser, guest, or licensee, but rather an invitee who entered the restroom without the club's permission."
