A random sample of 20 employees was taken and their salaries recorded. A 95 percent t-confidence interval for the mean salary of the county school system employees is ($15,360, $32,470).

The skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied.\n\nIn a right-skewed distribution, the mean is pulled towards the higher end of the distribution, which means that the sample mean will be higher than the population mean. This is because the sample size is small compared to the population size, and the sample mean will be influenced by the outlier (the superintendent's salary). Therefore, the t-confidence interval will not be appropriate because the assumption of normality is not satisfied."
