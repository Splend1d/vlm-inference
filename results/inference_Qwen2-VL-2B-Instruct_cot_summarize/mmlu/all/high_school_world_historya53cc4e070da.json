They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.\n\u2014Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847\nWhich event or period in Japan's history best reflects Lord Ii's concerns?\n\nA.

Lord Ii is concerned about the potential for Japan to be overwhelmed by foreign powers, especially considering the advancements in maritime technology and military capabilities.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan\n- This event occurred in the 19th century, but it was not directly related to the steamships or the efficiency of foreign armies. It was more about the religious influence on Japan.\n\nB. The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court\n- This was a cultural change rather than a military or technological advancement. It did not directly address the threat posed by foreign powers.\n\nC. The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese\n- This was a historical event that occurred in the 19th century, but it was not directly related to the steamships or the efficiency of foreign armies. It was more about territorial expansion.\n\nD. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade\n- This was a significant event in the 19th century, but it was not directly related to the steamships or the efficiency of foreign armies. It was more about economic and political changes.\n\nConsidering the context and the letter's focus on the threat posed by foreign powers, the best reflection of Lord Ii's concerns is:\n\nD. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade\n\nThis event directly addresses the threat of foreign powers and the need for Japan to adapt to modern maritime and economic challenges."
