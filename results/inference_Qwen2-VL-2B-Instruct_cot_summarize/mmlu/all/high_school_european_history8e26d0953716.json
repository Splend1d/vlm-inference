If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following was the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV?\n\nA. His domination of the nobility left him without friends and allies.\nB. He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.\nC. He left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants.\nD. He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him.\n"

The memoir does not mention the king's lack of friends or allies.\n\n2. **He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.**\n   - This statement is somewhat plausible. The memoir mentions that Louis XIV was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree and used to cast his eyes to right and left, observing everyone. This suggests that he was overly concerned with appearances and possibly neglecting the practical aspects of governance.\n\n3. **He left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants.**\n   - This statement is not directly supported by the given information. The memoir does not mention the king leaving the administration to intendants.\n\n4. **He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him.**\n   - This statement is not directly supported by the given information. The memoir does not mention any war or major power conflicts.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that best captures the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV is:\n\n**B. He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.**"
