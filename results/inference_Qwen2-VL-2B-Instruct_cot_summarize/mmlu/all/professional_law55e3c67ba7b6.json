The high school was severely damaged and needed to be rebuilt. As a consequence, the city council held an emergency meeting to determine what measures should be taken to locate an appropriate alternative facility in which to conduct classes. Thereupon, the city council passed the following resolution: \"During restoration of the high school building, classes shall be conducted at the most suitable facility which submits the lowest bid. In determining a \u0080\u0098suitable' facility, the city council shall consider such factors as location and available classroom space. \"Several bids were submitted. The lowest bid was submitted by a church. The church was located on the same block as the high school and contained sufficient seating capacity for all students. In addition, there were a sufficient number of separate rooms to allow different classes to meet at the same time. The city council voted unanimously to accept the church's offer. Furthermore, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms utilized by the students. Only the main chapel was exempt, so that it could remain open for prayer. No high school classes or activities were to be held in the main chapel. A parent of one of the high school students is upset at this arrangement. On his son's behalf, the parent has filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church. Judgment for whom?\n\nA. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\nB. The city, because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\nD. The plaintiff, because the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church-owned facility. The plaintiff, in this case, is the parent of one of the high school students who is upset at the arrangement. The court will determine whether the emergency measure passed by the city council, which allows classes to be conducted at the church, is necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\n- This option suggests that the arrangement does not violate religious freedom. However, the issue is not about religious freedom but about the constitutionality of the emergency measure.\n\nB. The city, because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\n- This option implies that the city council acted based on the lowest bid, which is not relevant to the constitutionality of the emergency measure.\n\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\n- This option suggests that the arrangement is excessive and violates the plaintiff's religious freedom. The court will likely find this arrangement unconstitutional.\n\nD. The plaintiff, because the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n- This option suggests that the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest. The court will likely find this arrangement unconstitutional.\n\nGiven the context and the issue at hand, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C."
