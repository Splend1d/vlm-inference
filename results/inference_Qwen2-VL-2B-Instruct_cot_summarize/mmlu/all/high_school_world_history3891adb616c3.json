Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the two passages and determine which statement accurately reflects the context and implications of the Cawnpore Massacre.\n\n1. **Identify the type of logical reasoning involved**: This problem involves comprehension and interpretation of historical events, specifically focusing on the context and implications of the Cawnpore Massacre.\n\n2. **Comprehend the context and core of the question**: The passage discusses the Cawnpore Massacre, which was a violent event in which black men, including slaves and women, killed British officials and civilians. It highlights the violence as a part of the British colonial presence in India and the ways in which the British government used violence to maintain its power.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **A. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.**\n     - This option suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre was justified by local military customs, which contradicts the passage's emphasis on the violence as a reaction to British colonialism and the systemic brutality of British rule.\n   - **B. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.**\n     - This option aligns well with the passage's description of the Cawnpore Massacre as a reaction to the British colonial system, where the British used violence to maintain their power.\n   - **C. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.**\n     - This option suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre should be praised for its patriotic actions against British colonialism, which is not supported by the passage. The passage emphasizes the violence as a reaction to British colonialism and the systemic brutality of British rule.\n   - **D. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.**\n     - This option suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre was a well-planned and organized conspiracy, which is not supported by the passage. The passage describes the event as a spontaneous and unorganized reaction to British colonialism.\n\n4. **Conclude with the final answer**: The passage emphasizes that the Cawnpore Massacre was a violent event that was a reaction to British colonialism and the systemic brutality of British rule. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.**"
