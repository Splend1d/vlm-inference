Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n"

                    "text": "The man is likely to prevail in this case. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Easement Extinguishment**: The easement was conveyed by the man to the woman five years ago. This means that the easement is now extinguished. The man has no longer been the owner of the land that the easement was conveyed over.\n\n2. **Notice of Easement**: The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path, which was promptly recorded. This means that the man had notice of the easement when he conveyed it to the woman.\n\n3. **Purchaser's Acquisition**: The man conveyed the house to the purchaser by a warranty deed two years ago. The warranty deed is a legal document that transfers title to the property. It does not convey any easement rights.\n\n4. **Notice of Easement**: The man did not take actual possession of the house, and the easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. Therefore, the man did not have notice of the easement when he conveyed the house to the purchaser.\n\nGiven these points, the man has no longer been the owner of the land that the easement was conveyed over, and the easement is now extinguished. The man has no notice of the easement when he conveyed the house to the purchaser, so the purchaser cannot claim an easement over the man's land.\n\nTherefore, the man is likely to prevail because the easement is extinguished and the purchaser did not have notice of the easement at the time of acquisition."
