The defendant moved to dismiss the action, and the court granted the motion in an order that stated: \"The defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, and this action is dismissed with prejudice.\" The court accordingly entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff then filed the same claim against the defendant in federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. The defendant has asserted the defense of res judicata (claim preclusion) in its answer. Should the federal court give preclusive effect to the state court judgment?\n\nA. No, because the judgment was entered by a state court, not a federal court.\nB. No, because the state court did not rule on the merits in its dismissal.\nC. Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\nD. Yes, because a judgment for failure to prosecute operates as a judgment on the merits under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n"

Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\n\nWhen a plaintiff files a tort action in state court and then fails to prosecute the action, the court may enter a judgment dismissing the case with prejudice. This means that the judgment is final and cannot be appealed. The defendant may then move to dismiss the action in federal court, and the federal court will grant the motion if it finds that the state court judgment is conclusive and not subject to appeal.\n\nThe state court judgment is considered conclusive because it is entered with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be appealed. The federal court will not consider the state court judgment as evidence of the defendant's liability, as it is not subject to appeal. Therefore, the federal court will give preclusive effect to the state court judgment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
