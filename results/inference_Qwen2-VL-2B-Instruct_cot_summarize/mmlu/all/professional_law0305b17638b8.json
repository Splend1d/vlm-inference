Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.\nB. The plaintiff will prevail unless denial of membership to women can be justified by some \"compelling interest,\" since such discrimination is \"suspect\" and requires the strictest equal protection test.\nC. The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.\nD. The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most accurate statement, let's analyze the given information and the context provided:\n\n1. The plaintiff claims that the company's policy of excluding women from membership as a group violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n2. The company's bylaws require the establishment of a yacht club with strict membership standards, including a policy of excluding women.\n3. The membership committee has a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women.\n4. The plaintiff's application was denied because she is a woman, and she claims this discrimination violates her equal protection rights.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.\n   - This statement is incorrect because the Equal Protection Clause specifically addresses discrimination based on sex, and the plaintiff's claim is based on this violation.\n\nB. The plaintiff will prevail unless denial of membership to women can be justified by some \"compelling interest,\" since such discrimination is \"suspect\" and requires the strictest equal protection test.\n   - This statement is incorrect because the Equal Protection Clause does not require the strictest equal protection test for discrimination based on sex. The plaintiff's claim is based on the violation of the Equal Protection Clause, not on the strictness of the equal protection test.\n\nC. The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.\n   - This statement is incorrect because the plaintiff's claim is based on the violation of the Equal Protection Clause, not on the availability of other similar facilities to women.\n\nD. The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n   - This statement is correct because the plaintiff's claim is based on the violation of the Equal Protection Clause, and the company must prove that the exclusion of women is justified by some important basis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is:\n\nD. The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women."
