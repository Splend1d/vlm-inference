Instead, it aimed to end discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and public facilities, including schools. The act did not include enforcement provisions, which meant that it was not a law that could be enforced by the federal government. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Because it included no enforcement provisions, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had no appreciable effect on school desegregation."
