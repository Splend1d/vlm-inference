The difference between the appraised value of the land and the fair value of the machinery is $50,000 - $55,000 = -$5,000.\n3. Since the difference between the fair value of the machinery and the original cost of the land is positive, the gain on the exchange is the difference between these two values, which is $35,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $35,000."
