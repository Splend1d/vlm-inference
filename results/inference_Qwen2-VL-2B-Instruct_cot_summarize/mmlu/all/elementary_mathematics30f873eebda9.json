First, we can factorize each number into its prime factors:\n   - 25 = \\(5^2\\)\n   - 55 = \\(5 \\times 11\\)\n\n2. Next, we look for the common prime factors between the two numbers. In this case, the common prime factors are 5.\n\n3. Since 5 is the largest number that divides both 25 and 55, the GCD is 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 5"
