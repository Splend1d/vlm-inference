That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe\nB. Refinement of gunpowder technologies\nC. The development and application of steam-powered technologies\nD.
