This is a one-tailed test because we are only interested in whether the sample mean is greater than the true mean.\n\nThe sample mean is given by:\n\n\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( x_i \\) are the individual weights and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n\nThe sample mean is:\n\n\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303}{7} = \\frac{2100}{7} = 300 \\]\n\nThe sample mean is equal to the true mean, so the null hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) is that the true mean is 300 mg. The alternative hypothesis \\( H_a \\) is that the true mean is not 300 mg.\n\nThe test statistic \\( t \\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the true mean, \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation, and \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) is the sample size.\n\nThe sample standard deviation \\( s \\) is:\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}} \\]\n\nThe sample size \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sample standard deviation \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{(299-300)^2 + (300-300)^2 + (305-300)^2 + (302-300)^2 + (299-300)^2 + (301-300)^2 + (303-300)^2}{7-1}} \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 + 0 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 9}{6}} \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{6}} \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{3.333...} \\]\n\n\\[ s \\approx 1.82 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the test statistic \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{300 - 300}{1.82/\\sqrt{7}} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-100}{1.82/3.16} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-100}{0.59} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx -16.84 \\]\n\nThe P-value of the test is the probability of observing a sample mean as extreme as or more extreme than the observed sample mean, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Since we are only interested in whether the sample mean is greater than the true mean, we are looking for the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg. This is the same as the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, but with a one-tailed test.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, which is the same as the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, but with a one-tailed test.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, which is the same as the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, but with a one-tailed test.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, which is the same as the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, but with a one-tailed test.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of observing a sample mean of 300 mg or more, given that the true mean is 300 mg, which is the same as the"
