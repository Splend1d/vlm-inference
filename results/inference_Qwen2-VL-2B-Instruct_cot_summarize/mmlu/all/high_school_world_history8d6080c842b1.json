It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power.

                    "text": "To determine which of the following most inspired the national plan advanced by Kwame Nkrumah in the second paragraph, let's analyze the context and the core of the question.\n\nThe passage discusses the struggle against neo-colonialism and the non-alignment policy of Ghana and other countries. It highlights the importance of foreign investment from capitalist countries but emphasizes that such investment must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Fascism - This ideology promotes the idea of a strong, centralized state and often involves the suppression of individual freedoms and the suppression of dissent. It does not align with the idea of a non-aligned policy that involves cooperation and investment in accordance with a national plan.\n\nB. Social Darwinism - This ideology promotes the idea that the strongest and most efficient individuals will naturally emerge from society. It does not align with the idea of a non-aligned policy that involves cooperation and investment in accordance with a national plan.\n\nC. Classical liberalism - This ideology emphasizes individual freedom, limited government intervention, and free markets. It does not align with the idea of a non-aligned policy that involves cooperation and investment in accordance with a national plan.\n\nD. Socialism - This ideology promotes the idea of a society where the means of production are owned and controlled by the state. It does not align with the idea of a non-aligned policy that involves cooperation and investment in accordance with a national plan.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the question, the most inspired national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph is:\n\nD. Socialism\n\nSocialism aligns with the idea of a non-aligned policy that involves cooperation and investment in accordance with a national plan."
