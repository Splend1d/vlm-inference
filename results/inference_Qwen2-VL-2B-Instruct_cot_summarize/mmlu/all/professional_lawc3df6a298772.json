At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification by the witness.\nB. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.\n"

Hearsay evidence is not admissible in court unless it falls under one of the recognized exceptions, such as the rule of evidence that allows testimony about a witness's prior statements made under oath. In this case, the owner's testimony about the man's appearance before he shaved his head is not admissible because it is not a statement made under oath."
