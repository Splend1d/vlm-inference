                    "text": "The minimum thickness of the oil film is the distance between the glass and the oil, which is the difference between the index of refraction of the oil and the index of refraction of the glass. \n\nThe formula for the index of refraction of a medium is:\n\nn = (sin(\u03b81) / sin(\u03b82))\n\nwhere n is the index of refraction, \u03b81 is the angle of incidence, and \u03b82 is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this case, the angle of incidence is 0 (since the light is viewed near normal incidence), and the angle of refraction is 90 degrees (since the light is reflected off the oil). Therefore, we can use the formula for the index of refraction of a medium:\n\nn = (sin(0) / sin(90)) = 0 / 1 = 0\n\nThe minimum thickness of the oil film is the difference between the index of refraction of the oil and the index of refraction of the glass:\n\nn_oil - n_glass = 1.2 - 1.6 = -0.4\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the oil is denser than the glass. Therefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film is:\n\nd = n_oil - n_glass = -0.4 nm = 400 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film is 400 nm.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 400 nm."
