The weights of the books are 2.5, 3.2, 2.7, and 2.3 pounds.\n\nSince the weight of each book is given as a positive value, we can start by considering the smallest possible value for \\(w\\), which is 2.5 pounds. The largest possible value for \\(w\\) would be the sum of the weights of the four books, which is \\(2.5 + 3.2 + 2.7 + 2.3 = 10\\) pounds.\n\nTherefore, the inequality that represents the weight, \\(w\\), of any book chosen from the shelf is:\n\nD. \\(w < 3.3\\)"
