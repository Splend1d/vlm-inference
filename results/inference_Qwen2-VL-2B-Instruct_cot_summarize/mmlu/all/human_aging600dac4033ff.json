A higher proportion of older women have completed menopause\n\nThis is more likely to be a cohort difference rather than an age difference because it refers to a group of people who share a common characteristic (having completed menopause) at a specific point in time (older age). Age differences refer to the difference between two groups of people who are not necessarily at the same point in time."
