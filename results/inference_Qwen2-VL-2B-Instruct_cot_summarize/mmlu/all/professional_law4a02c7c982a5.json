                    "text": "Recently, Congress enacted a statute requiring all boat owners to register their boats with a newly created federal boat registry. Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the statute is likely to be held constitutional, we need to analyze the constitutional and legislative powers involved in the statute.\n\n1. **Purpose of the statute**: The statute aims to prevent theft of boats in coastal waters and protect individual boat owners throughout the United States. It is enacted despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles, indicating that the federal government is attempting to regulate the registration process.\n\n2. **State vs. Federal Regulation**: The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states or to the people. This suggests that the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\n\n3. **Interstate Commerce**: The statute is enacted to prevent theft of boats in coastal waters and protect individual boat owners, which could be considered an interstate commerce regulation. However, the primary purpose of the statute is to regulate the registration process, not to prevent theft or interstate commerce.\n\n4. **Regulation of Property**: The statute is enacted to regulate the registration process, which is a property regulation. The Tenth Amendment does not specifically address property regulation, but it does protect against unconstitutionally broad regulation of property.\n\nGiven these points, the statute is likely to be held constitutional because it is a property regulation that Congress has the power to regulate for the general welfare. The Tenth Amendment does not specifically address property regulation, but it does protect against unconstitutionally broad regulation of property.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.**"
