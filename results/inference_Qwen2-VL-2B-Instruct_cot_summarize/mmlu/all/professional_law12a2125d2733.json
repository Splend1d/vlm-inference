Before receiving an answer, the purchasing agent called the wholesaler to state, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase.\" The seller sent an acceptance form the next day, and shipped the goods with an invoice. When the purchasing company did not pay and shipped the goods back, the seller sued for his lost profit. The seller claimed that the purchasing agent's words did not clearly communicate a revocation of the offer. Will the seller prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection in order to be enforced.\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\nC. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\nD. No, because a buyer is never in breach of an agreement when it rejects goods prior to their shipment.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the seller will prevail in this situation, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in revocation of an offer and breach of contract.\n\n1. **Revocation of an Offer**: An offer is revocable if it is clear and explicit. The seller's words to the wholesaler, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase,\" clearly communicate that the offer is being withdrawn. This is because the offer is not vague or ambiguous; it is specific and unambiguous.\n\n2. **Breach of Contract**: A breach of contract occurs when a party fails to perform their obligations as agreed. In this case, the seller claims that the purchasing agent's words did not clearly communicate a revocation of the offer. However, the seller's claim is based on the interpretation of the words used by the wholesaler, not on the clarity of the offer itself.\n\n3. **Clear Communication**: For a revocation of an offer to be enforceable, it must be communicated clearly and explicitly. The seller's argument that the words used by the wholesaler were not clear enough to communicate a revocation is not a valid defense. The wholesaler's words were clear and explicit, and the offer was revocable.\n\n4. **Defective Performance**: The seller's claim that the purchasing agent's words did not clearly communicate a revocation is not a valid defense. The seller's breach of contract is based on the seller's own failure to communicate the revocation of the offer clearly and explicitly.\n\nGiven these points, the seller cannot prevail in this situation because the seller's claim is based on an interpretation of the wholesaler's words, which is not a valid defense. The seller's words were clear and explicit, and the offer was revocable.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. No, because a buyer is never in breach of an agreement when it rejects goods prior to their shipment."
