I had the culprit burned, explaining that the cause was his having killed that Indian and eaten him[,] which was prohibited by Your Majesty, and by me in Your Royal name. I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them.\n\u2014Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521\nWhich of the following was NOT a result of the European conquest of the Americas realized by the end of the seventeenth century?\n\nA.

Europeans expanded the African slave trade in response to the establishment of a plantation economy in the Americas and to demographic catastrophes among indigenous peoples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
