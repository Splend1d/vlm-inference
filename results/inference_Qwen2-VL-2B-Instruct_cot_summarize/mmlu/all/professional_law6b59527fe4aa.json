The article was false, and was printed without adequate research. The doctor sued the newspaper company, claiming damages per se. The paper defended on the basis that this was a public interest article, that the paper was not reckless or malicious in its investigation and reporting, and that the doctor could not prove any special damages. Will the court adopt the defense reasoning and dismiss the case for failure to state a claim?\n\nA. Yes, the doctor is a professional figure in the community and he must accept the risk of false reporting, especially where he cannot prove any special damages.\nB. Yes, the newspaper is allowed to make mistakes as long as there is no malice, and the case must be dismissed as a matter of law.\nC. No, this fits the requirements for slander per se and there is a valid claim of malice stated against the paper.\nD. No, this fits the requirements for libel per se, which is so inflammatory that the doctor does not have to prove special damages.\n"

No, this fits the requirements for slander per se and there is a valid claim of malice stated against the paper.\n\nThe court will likely dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. The newspaper's defense is based on the principle of slander per se, which is that the newspaper's article was false and therefore constitutes slander. The doctor's claim of damages per se is based on the newspaper's negligence in reporting the false information. The court will likely find that the newspaper's article was false and that the doctor cannot prove any special damages, thus dismissing the case for failure to state a claim.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. This option is incorrect because the doctor is not a professional figure in the community and does not have to accept the risk of false reporting.\nB. This option is incorrect because the newspaper's defense is based on the principle of slander per se, not negligence.\nD. This option is incorrect because the newspaper's defense is based on slander per se, not libel per se."
