Adjoining the orchard directly to the west was a 10-acre vineyard that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. A four-lane highway adjoined the orchard directly to the east. The farmer discovered that the southern portion of the orchard was rarely used by the landowner for any of the landowner's farming activities and found a convenient gravel road leading from the vineyard across the orchard all the way to the four- lane highway. The farmer used this road adversely and openly for the entire 20-year prescriptive period, and in doing so, the farmer has acquired a prescriptive easement over the roadway across the orchard. Thereafter, the farmer conveys the vineyard to a buyer in fee simple. The deed recited that \"the grantor hereby conveys the vineyard, together with an easement for the right of way across the orcharX, to the grantee. \"After the buyer took possession of the vineyard, the landowner brought an appropriate action to prevent him from using the roadway across the orchard. The issue that will determine the outcome of this suit is whether\n\nA. the description in the farmer's deed to the buyer was adequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway.\nB. the buyer will make excessive use of the roadway.\nC. easements can be reserved to third parties.\nD. the easement was appurtenant.\n"
