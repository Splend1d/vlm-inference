Thereafter, the skier sued the ski resort alleging negligent maintenance of the ski lift machinery. The ski resort's skier's attorney took a discovery deposition of a witness who was seated behind the skier at the time of the accident. The witness died shortly after the deposition. At trial, the skier offers the witness's deposition testimony into evidence. Upon objection by the ski resort's attorney, the deposition is\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible, provided that the witness's statements are more probative on the point than any other evidence the skier can procure through reasonable efforts and that the skier has given the ski resort reasonable notice that she would offer the deposition.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the ski resort's right to confront the witnesses against itself.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Hearsay is admissible only when it is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n2. **Notice Requirement**: The skier must have given the ski resort reasonable notice that she would offer the deposition. This notice requirement is not met here because the deposition was taken shortly after the accident and the witness died shortly after the deposition, making it impossible for the ski resort to have given the witness reasonable notice.\n\n3. **Admissibility Exception**: There is no recognized exception to the hearsay rule that would allow the deposition testimony to be admitted. The only exception to the hearsay rule is when the witness is unavailable for the trial, but in this case, the witness died shortly after the deposition, making it impossible for the ski resort to have given the witness reasonable notice.\n\nTherefore, the deposition testimony is inadmissible because it violates the hearsay rule and does not meet the notice requirement."
