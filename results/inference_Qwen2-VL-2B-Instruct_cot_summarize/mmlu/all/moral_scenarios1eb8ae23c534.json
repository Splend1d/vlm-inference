Ironing clothes while children are playing outside is generally considered a violation of the child's right to a safe and comfortable environment. This action can be seen as neglectful and irresponsible, especially if the child is not aware of the danger.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is not doing anything clearly morally wrong. Dressing up as a serial killer and walking around town with a fake kitchen knife is a form of behavior that is not considered morally wrong in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This behavior is often seen as a form of artistic expression or a form of self-expression, and it is not typically considered a violation of societal norms."
