After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\nC.

This would provide a strong basis for the court to find that the juror's bias and prejudice significantly influenced their verdict, thereby violating the defendant's right to a fair trial. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\n - This would not necessarily be a significant factor in securing a new trial, as the juror's misunderstanding of the instructions would not necessarily impact the fairness of the trial.\n\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\n - This would not be a strong basis for a new trial because the juror's actions were not related to the defendant's guilt or innocence but rather to the defendant's credibility.\n\nC. A juror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.\n - This would not be a strong basis for a new trial because the juror's fall asleep during the argument would not necessarily impact the fairness of the trial.\n\nD. A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.\n - This would not be a strong basis for a new trial because the juror's animosity was admitted during deliberations, not during the trial itself.\n\nTherefore, the affidavit of a juror who admitted to having a personal animosity toward the defendant would be the most likely basis for securing a new trial."
