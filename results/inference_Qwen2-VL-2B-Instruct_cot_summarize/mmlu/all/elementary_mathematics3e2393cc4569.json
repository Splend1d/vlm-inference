There are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the total number of students in the entire fourth grade is 5 times the number of students in Mr. Clark's class. Therefore, the equation that can be used to determine the number of students, n, in the entire fourth grade is:\n\nC. 20x5=n\n\nThis equation represents the relationship between the number of students in Mr. Clark's class and the entire fourth grade, where n is the total number of students in the entire fourth grade."
