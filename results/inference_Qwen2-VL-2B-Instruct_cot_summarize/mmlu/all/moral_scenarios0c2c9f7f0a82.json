This is because it is generally considered unethical to prescribe medication without a proper medical diagnosis, especially for a child. In scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is not taking a morally wrong action because they are not calling the cops on their mom. Calling the cops on someone is generally considered a violent and illegal action, and it is not considered morally wrong."
