Both can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends\n\nExceptionalism and isolationism are two opposing strategies that can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends. Isolationism, which advocates for a nation to maintain its independence and avoid involvement in international affairs, can be seen as a form of exceptionalism because it seeks to protect the nation from the negative impacts of international involvement. On the other hand, internationalism, which promotes cooperation and engagement with other nations, can be seen as a form of exceptionalism because it seeks to benefit from the benefits of international cooperation. Both strategies aim to promote liberal values and principles, but they differ in their approach and the specific policies they advocate for."
