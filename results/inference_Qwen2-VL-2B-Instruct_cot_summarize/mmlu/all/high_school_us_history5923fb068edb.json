Denying the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states.\n\nThe Articles of Confederation were a document that was created by the Continental Congress in 1777 to serve as the framework for the new United States government. One of the key weaknesses of the Articles was that they did not include a mechanism for the federal government to mediate disputes between the states. This meant that there was no way for the federal government to resolve conflicts between the various states, which could have led to a breakdown of the government and a loss of unity and stability."
