Which of the following is the primary reason for this phenomenon?\n\nA. The molecules of the person are, on average, moving faster than those of the surroundings.\nB. Thermal energy moves from high concentration areas (hot) to low concentration areas (cold).\nC. As heat flows out of the person and warms the fluid surrounding the person, the warmer fluid rises, allowing fresh cool fluid to come in contact with the person and increasing the rate of heat transfer.\nD. Water has more molecules per volume than air, increasing molecular contact with the person.\n"

As heat flows out of the person and warms the fluid surrounding the person, the warmer fluid rises, allowing fresh cool fluid to come in contact with the person and increasing the rate of heat transfer.\n\nThis is because when a person is exposed to cold water, the warm water surrounding the person cools down, causing the warmer fluid to rise. This movement of fluid allows for a more efficient exchange of heat between the person and the surrounding water, which can lead to hypothermia and potentially death if not treated promptly."
