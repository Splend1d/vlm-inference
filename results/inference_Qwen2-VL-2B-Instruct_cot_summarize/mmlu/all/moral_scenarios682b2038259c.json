It is not uncommon for people to use sick days for personal reasons, but calling in sick to work for a movie ticket is a clear violation of the employer's policy and the company's rules.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character left their hamburger wrapper in the ocean after a picnic on the beach. This is a morally ambiguous situation, as it is not clear whether the action was intentional or accidental. However, it is generally considered morally wrong to litter, regardless of the intent behind the action."
