Whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing.\n\nAge discrimination is a legal issue that can arise when an employer fires an employee based solely on their age, rather than their work performance or other relevant factors. This can be a violation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act (EEOA) and other anti-discrimination laws. To address this issue, it is important for the psychologist to understand that the basis for firing an employee should be their age, not their work performance. This means that if an employee is fired because they are older, regardless of their work performance, they may have grounds for a legal claim of age discrimination."
