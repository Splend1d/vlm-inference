                    "text": "A 10-year-old girl decided to go sledding during a heavy snow and ice storm. She planned to go sledding down Hill Street, a steep and winding thoroughfare. Hill Street, which was located around the corner from the girl's home, was a popular sledding site because of its precipitous incline. The girl's parents had given her permission to sled down Hill Street. On the way to Hill Street, the girl met a classmate, who was 12, and asked if she wanted to join her. The classmate agreed, and the two girls walked to the top of Hill Street together. There, the youngsters mounted the sled. The girl was sitting in front and controlling the steering mechanism while the classmate was behind her. They started their descent at a relatively good speed. As they were about halfway down the road, they approached the intersection of Hill Street and Maple Drive. A driver, who was driving his car along Maple Drive, entered the intersection at the same time as the girls on the sled. When the classmate saw the driver's auto cross into their path, she shouted to the girl to fall off the sled. The girl became frightened and refused to jump off. Just before the sled collided with the car, the classmate pushed the girl off the sled. Her push caused the girl to fall and break her leg. The classmate couldn't get off the sled in time and was struck and injured by the driver's car. If the girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the classmate to recover damages for the girl's broken leg, will they prevail?\n\nA. No, if the classmate believed that the girl was in imminent peril when she pushed her off the sled.\nB. No, unless the classmate acted unreasonably when she pushed the girl off the sled.\nC. No, if the driver was driving negligently.\nD. No, because the classmate had the girl's implied consent to act in an emergency.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where a 12-year-old girl was pushed off a sled by another individual, resulting in her breaking her leg. The key issue here is whether the classmate's action was reasonable and whether the girl had implied consent to be pushed off the sled.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No, if the classmate believed that the girl was in imminent peril when she pushed her off the sled.**\n   - This option suggests that the classmate believed the girl was in danger. If the classmate believed the girl was in imminent peril, it would be reasonable for her to act to protect her. However, the scenario does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the classmate believed the girl was in danger. The classmate's actions were based on the girl's behavior, not her own perception of danger.\n\nB. **No, unless the classmate acted unreasonably when she pushed the girl off the sled.**\n   - This option suggests that the classmate's actions were unreasonable. The scenario does not provide enough information to determine whether the classmate's actions were unreasonable. The classmate's actions were based on the girl's behavior, not her own perception of danger.\n\nC. **No, if the driver was driving negligently.**\n   - This option suggests that the driver's negligence played a role in the accident. The scenario does not provide enough information to determine whether the driver was driving negligently. The driver's actions were based on the girl's behavior, not her own perception of danger.\n\nD. **No, because the classmate had the girl's implied consent to act in an emergency.**\n   - This option suggests that the classmate had implied consent to act in an emergency. If the classmate had implied consent to act in an emergency, it would be reasonable for her to act to protect the girl. However, the scenario does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the classmate had implied consent to act in an emergency.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most reasonable conclusion is that the classmate's actions were reasonable and that the girl had implied consent to be pushed off the sled. Therefore, the girl's parents would likely prevail in their claim against the classmate.\n\n**Final Answer: D. No, because the classmate had the girl's implied consent to act in an emergency.**"
