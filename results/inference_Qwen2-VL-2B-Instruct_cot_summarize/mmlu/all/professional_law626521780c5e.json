                    "text": "The United States Congress passed, and the President signed, a law called the \"American Morality Leadership Act\" which limits the amount of makeup that women or men can wear in public and precludes the wearing of short dresses. Men over 65 must wear only brown or grey attire, while those under 65 must wear button down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action was filed to challenge the Act based on a constitutional attack. Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?\n\nA. The law is unconstitutional because it violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nB. The law is unconstitutional because it is primarily discriminatory against women's rights.\nC. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n"

The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n\nThis argument focuses on the law's impact on individual rights, specifically the right to privacy and freedom of expression, which are fundamental rights protected by the Constitution. The Act's restrictions on dress and grooming for both men and women, including the prohibition on short dresses and the requirement for button-down dress shirts with ties, could be seen as a violation of these rights. The court would likely consider whether the law's restrictions are necessary to achieve a compelling government interest and whether they are narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual."
