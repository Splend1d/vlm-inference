The margin of error is a measure of the uncertainty in the results of a survey. It is calculated as the difference between the sample mean and the population mean, divided by the standard error of the mean.\n\nGiven that the survey concluded that 82% of the population uses grocery coupons, and the margin of error is 3%, we can calculate the range of possible values for the population proportion using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = \\frac{\\text{Standard Error of the Mean}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}} \\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM):\n\n\\[ \\text{SEM} = \\frac{\\text{Margin of Error}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{SEM} = \\frac{0.03}{\\sqrt{500}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{SEM} = \\frac{0.03}{7.07} \\approx 0.0042 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the range of possible values for the population proportion:\n\n\\[ \\text{Lower Bound} = 0.82 - 0.0042 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Upper Bound} = 0.82 + 0.0042 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Lower Bound} \\approx 0.8168 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Upper Bound} \\approx 0.8232 \\]\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Three percent of those surveyed refused to participate in the poll.\nB. It would not be unexpected for 3% of the population to begin using coupons or stop using coupons.\nC. Between 395 and 425 of the 500 households surveyed responded that they used grocery coupons.\nD. It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Between 395 and 425 of the 500 households surveyed responded that they used grocery coupons."
