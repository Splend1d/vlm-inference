Tropical rainforest\n\nThe researcher found 35 percent more species than she has found in any other biome, which suggests that the biome she is most likely to be in is one with a high species diversity, such as the tropical rainforest. This is because tropical rainforests are known for their rich biodiversity, with an estimated 100,000 species, making them the most diverse biome on Earth."
