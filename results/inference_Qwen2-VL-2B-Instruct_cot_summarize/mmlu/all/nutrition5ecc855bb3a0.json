No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\nB. It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\nC. Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\nD. Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanises.\n"

Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\n\nUrbanisation can lead to a significant increase in food prices due to the increased demand for food in urban areas. This can lead to food insecurity and malnutrition for urban dwellers, who may not have access to affordable food options or may not have the means to grow their own food. Additionally, urbanisation can lead to a decrease in agricultural production, which can further exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition in urban areas."
