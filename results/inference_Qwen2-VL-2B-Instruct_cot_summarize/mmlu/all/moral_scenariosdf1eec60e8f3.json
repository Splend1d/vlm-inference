Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, breaking the glass ceiling on stockholder expectations is generally considered a positive action that aligns with the principles of fair treatment and the advancement of women in the workplace. It is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nIn Scenario 2, calling the cops on the man who hit your child is a morally wrong action. It is illegal to use force against a child, and it can lead to serious consequences for the perpetrator. Calling the cops is a reasonable response to a violent act, but it is not a justifiable action in this case."
