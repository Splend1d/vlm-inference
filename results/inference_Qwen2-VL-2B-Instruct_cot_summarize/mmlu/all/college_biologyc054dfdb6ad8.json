Brood parasites, such as the cuckoo, are able to trick other species of birds into rearing their own young by exploiting the host birds' instinctive response to the loud begging cues of a fledgling in their nest. The key to their success is that the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring remain in the gene pool of the population because:\n\nThe genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because:\n\nB. the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species.\n\nThis is because the cuckoo's success in tricking the host birds into rearing its young does not necessarily harm the host birds' own offspring. The host birds' response to the cuckoo's begging cues allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry, which is a more efficient strategy than rearing the cuckoo fledglings. Therefore, the genes that allow the host birds to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring are not detrimental to the host birds' own fitness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species."
