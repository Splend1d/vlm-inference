Such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0.\n\nThe net force between two charged particles is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant, \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the charges of the particles, and \\( r \\) is the distance between them.\n\nFor the net force to be 0, the force between the particles must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to each other. This means that the force between the particles must be zero if the charges are equal and opposite.\n\nTherefore, the particles must have the same sign of charge, and their masses must be equal. The distance between the particles does not affect the net force between them."
