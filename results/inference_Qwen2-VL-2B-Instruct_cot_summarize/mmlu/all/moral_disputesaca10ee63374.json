The key premise here is that the lack of imagination is a reason to reject genetic enhancement, which is a form of enhancement that involves altering the genetic makeup of an individual.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Genetic enhancement is always morally permissible.\n- This option is not a premise of the argument. The argument does not claim that genetic enhancement is always morally permissible; it argues that it is not always permissible.\n\nB. Nature ought to be honored over personal choice.\n- This option is not a premise of the argument. The argument does not discuss the relationship between nature and personal choice; it focuses on the lack of imagination as a reason to reject genetic enhancement.\n\nC. Most people's conception of the varieties of goods is limited.\n- This option is not a premise of the argument. The argument does not discuss the limitations of people's conception of goods; it focuses on the lack of imagination as a reason to reject genetic enhancement.\n\nD. We ought to always leave the development of valuable traits up to chance.\n- This option is not a premise of the argument. The argument does not discuss the idea of leaving valuable traits to chance; it focuses on the lack of imagination as a reason to reject genetic enhancement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. nature ought to be honored over personal choice."
