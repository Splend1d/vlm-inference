They arranged a meeting to purchase the secrets from an unscrupulous employee of the pharmaceutical company in the company's New York office. The person selling the \"secrets\" was an undercover FBI agent. The envelope that he held, with the word \"Confidential\" typed on the outside of it, contained various recipes and gardening tips. When the defendants turned over the money, they were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it was legally impossible to steal trade secrets when in fact there were no trade secrets in the envelope. Will the federal district court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, legal impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nB. Yes, factual impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nC. No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\nD. No, the defendants were guilty of conspiracy as a matter of law.\n"

                    "text": "The federal district court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss the indictment based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Legal Impossibility as a Defense**: The defendants claim that it was legally impossible to steal trade secrets when in fact there were no trade secrets in the envelope. This claim is based on the legal principle of legal impossibility, which is a defense to criminal conspiracy. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, legal impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy if the defendant can show that the crime was impossible under the applicable law.\n\n2. **Factual Impossibility**: The defendants also argue that the fact that there were no trade secrets in the envelope makes the conspiracy illegal. This is a defense to the crime of conspiracy, which is based on the idea that the crime was not committed because the necessary elements of the crime were not present.\n\nGiven that the defendants can show both that it was impossible to steal trade secrets and that the conspiracy was illegal because there were no trade secrets, the court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss the indictment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, legal impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.**"
