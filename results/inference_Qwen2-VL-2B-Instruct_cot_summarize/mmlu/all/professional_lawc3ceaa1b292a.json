For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?\n\nA. No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.\nB.

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the interpretation of the condominium association's amendment to the covenants and restrictions, which prohibits future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment was promptly recorded, and the condominium association had a valid covenant requiring all sales to be approved by the association. The amendment was based on safety concerns, and the amendment did not affect families with children already living in balcony units.\n\nThe fair housing agency, however, claims that the amendment is unenforceable because it violates federal fair housing laws. The key point here is whether the amendment is discriminatory based on the presence of children.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.\n- This option suggests that the amendment is not discriminatory because families with children can still purchase units without balconies. However, the amendment prohibits future sales of balcony units to families with minor children, which directly affects families with children already living in balcony units. This directly violates the covenant requiring all sales to be approved by the association.\n\nB. No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety concerns.\n- This option suggests that the amendment is based on a legitimate safety concern. However, the amendment specifically prohibits future sales of balcony units to families with minor children, which directly affects families with children already living in balcony units. This directly violates the covenant requiring all sales to be approved by the association.\n\nC. Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.\n- This option suggests that the amendment is not discriminatory because families with children already living in units with balconies are not affected. However, the amendment prohibits future sales of balcony units to families with minor children, which directly affects families with children already living in balcony units. This directly violates the covenant requiring all sales to be approved by the association.\n\nD. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\n- This option suggests that the amendment is not discriminatory because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development. However, the amendment specifically prohibits future sales of balcony units to families with minor children, which directly affects families with children already living in balcony units. This directly violates the covenant requiring all sales to be approved by the association.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most reasonable conclusion is that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred. The amendment is discriminatory based on the presence of children, and it directly affects families with children already living in balcony units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies."
