It is commonly used to diagnose sleep disorders, monitor brain activity during sleep, and assess brain function. In the context of a nap, the EEG would most likely show a preponderance of delta waves, which are slow, low-frequency waves that are characteristic of deep sleep. These waves are often associated with relaxation and restfulness, which is why Cyrus feels worse after a nap."
