So the perimeter is $6 + b + c$.\n\nWe are given that the perimeter is $18$, so we can write the equation $6 + b + c = 18$.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by subtracting $6$ from both sides to get $b + c = 12$.\n\nWe are also given that the legs of the triangle are $6$ and $b$, so we can write the equation $6^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by squaring both sides to get $36 + 12b + b^2 = c^2$.\n\nWe can then subtract $36$ from both sides to get $12b + b^2 = c^2 - 36$.\n\nWe can then rearrange this equation to get $b^2 + 12b - (c^2 - 36) = 0$.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by combining like terms to get $b^2 + 12b + 36 - c^2 = 0$.\n\nWe can then rewrite this equation as $(b + 6)^2 - c^2 = 0$.\n\nWe can then factor this equation as $(b + 6 - c)(b + 6 + c) = 0$.\n\nSince $b$ and $c$ are lengths, they must be positive, so we can discard the negative solution.\n\nSo we have $(b + 6 - c)(b + 6 + c) = 0$.\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either $(b + 6 - c) = 0$ or $(b + 6 + c) = 0$.\n\nIf $(b + 6 - c) = 0$, then $b + 6 = c$, and the perimeter is $6 + b + c = 6 + b + b = 6 + 2b = 18$, which gives $b = 6$.\n\nIf $(b + 6 + c) = 0$, then $b + 6 = -c$, and the perimeter is $6 + b + c = 6 + 6 - c = 12 - c = 18$, which gives $c = 6$.\n\nHowever, we are given that the legs of the triangle are $6$ and $b$, and the hypotenuse is $c$. So we must have $b = 6$ and $c = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$. The answer is: $6$"
