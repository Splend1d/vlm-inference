It does not contribute to the U.S. GDP.\n\n2. **Market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States**: This is a domestic production, not a U.S. economic activity. It does not contribute to the U.S. GDP.\n\n3. **Market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan**: This is a domestic production, not a U.S. economic activity. It does not contribute to the U.S. GDP.\n\n4. **Market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens**: This is a domestic production, not a U.S. economic activity. It does not contribute to the U.S. GDP.\n\nTherefore, the transactions that are included in U.S. GDP are:\n\n**III.
