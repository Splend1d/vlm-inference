The context is that Carens, a liberal egalitarian, acknowledges that opening borders can have negative consequences, but he argues that these consequences are not necessarily major and feasible policy options will not entail major costs to current citizens.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. In practice, feasible policy options will not entail major costs to current citizens.\n- This option aligns with Carens' argument that the potential harm is not major and feasible policy options will not entail major costs. It is a direct consequence of his belief that the consequences are not major.\n\nB. Liberal egalitarianism is false, and so this possibility is irrelevant.\n- This option contradicts Carens' belief that liberal egalitarianism is false. He argues that liberal egalitarianism is relevant and that the possibility of harm is not irrelevant.\n\nC. Sometimes you have to do more harm than good in the short term to do more good in the long term.\n- This option is not directly supported by Carens' argument. While he acknowledges that there can be short-term harm, he does not explicitly state that it is always necessary to do more harm than good in the short term to do more good in the long term.\n\nD. All of the above.\n- This option encompasses all the points mentioned in A and B, making it the most comprehensive answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D."
