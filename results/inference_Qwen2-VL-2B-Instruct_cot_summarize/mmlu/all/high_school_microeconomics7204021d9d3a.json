An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter.\n- This statement is negative. It implies that having more butter than guns is better than having more guns, which is not necessarily true. It suggests that having more butter is a desirable state, but it does not necessarily mean that having more guns is worse.\n\nB. Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war.\n- This statement is positive. It suggests that nations should prioritize producing goods that are beneficial to their citizens, such as consumer goods, rather than weapons of war.\n\nC. The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs.\n- This statement is negative. It implies that the production possibilities frontier (PPF) is curved, which means that as one good increases, the other good decreases, and vice versa. This is not necessarily true. The PPF can be concave or convex depending on the specific production possibilities of the economy.\n\nD. Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense.\n- This statement is positive. It suggests that nations should allocate resources towards national defense, which is generally considered important for a country's security and stability.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is positive is:\n\nB. Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war."
