The patient has a barrel-shaped chest, which is a characteristic feature of a hyperinflated chest, and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum, which is a common finding in emphysema. The patient also has difficulty rising from a chair, which is a common symptom of paralytic ileus, a condition caused by a lesion involving the parasympathetic nervous system. The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with a lesion involving the parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
