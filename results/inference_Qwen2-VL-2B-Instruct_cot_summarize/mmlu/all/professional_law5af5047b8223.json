This revocation is\n\nA. valid, because the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the September 1 offer.\nB. valid, because there was no consideration to support an option contract.\nC. not valid, because the retailer had 90 days in which to accept.\nD. not valid, because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1.\n"

The retailer's letter accepted the offer, but the manufacturer's fax revoking the offer was received on the same day, which means the offer was still open at the time the fax was received. Therefore, the manufacturer's fax revoking the offer was not valid because the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the September 1 offer. The correct answer is:\n\nA. valid, because the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the September 1 offer."
