This bid was $30,000 lower than the construction company's next lowest bid for the kitchen work. As a result, the construction company lowered its bid by $20,000 before submitting it to the hospital board. After the construction company was awarded the construction bid and had accepted the subcontractor's offer, the subcontractor discovered that in his preparation of the quotation, he had overlooked some subsidiary kitchen installments required by the plans.

The construction company received a quotation from the subcontractor for $120,000, which was $30,000 lower than the next lowest bid for the kitchen work. This means the subcontractor's bid was significantly lower than the company's bid, which is a critical factor in determining the contract price.\n\n2. The construction company then lowered its bid by $20,000, which is a further reduction in the contract price.\n\n3. The subcontractor then brought suit for rescission of the contract, claiming that the mistake in the quotation was an essential element of the bargain. This means the mistake had to be a fundamental part of the contract to be considered an essential element.\n\n4. The mistake in the quotation was that the subcontractor had overlooked some subsidiary kitchen installments required by the plans. This mistake was not a computational error but rather a failure to include these necessary elements in the quotation.\n\n5. The mistake was not antecedent to the acceptance of the bid, as the subcontractor accepted the bid after the mistake was discovered. The mistake was made before the acceptance of the bid, and the subcontractor's acceptance of the bid was not contingent on the mistake.\n\n6. Therefore, the mistake was not an essential element of the bargain, and the subcontractor cannot prevail on the rescission claim.\n\nThe correct answer is C. not prevail, unless the construction company knew or should have known of the subcontractor's error."
