Subsidize the firm or its customers.\n\nA positive externality occurs when the production of a private good benefits individuals who are not directly involved in its production. To address this, the government can provide subsidies to the firm or its customers to encourage the production of the good. This can help to shift the market towards an efficient outcome by reducing the cost for consumers and making the good more affordable or accessible."
