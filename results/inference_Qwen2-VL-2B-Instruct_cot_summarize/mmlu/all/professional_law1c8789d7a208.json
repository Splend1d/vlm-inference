The court will consider whether the records were kept in the ordinary course of business. If the records were kept in the ordinary course of business, the court will likely allow them into evidence. The court will not require a greater foundation to establish the reliability of the records, as the defendant is the declarant and is available in court. The court will not dismiss the hearsay objection because the defendant is the declarant and is available in court."
