The purchaser noticed that the car made a squeaking noise when the brakes were applied, so the purchaser took the car back to the dealership to have the mechanic there take a look at it. The mechanic worked on the car and then told the purchaser that the problem had been fixed. A few days later, the brakes failed, causing the purchaser to crash into a tree. The purchaser suffered a serious head injury in the crash. If the purchaser asserts a claim against the car dealership for damages for his injuries, will the purchaser prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.\nB. Yes, because the dealership is strictly liable for defective repairs on cars it has sold.\nC. No, because the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles.\nD. No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes.\n"

Let's analyze each option in detail:\n\nA. **Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.**\n   - This option suggests that the dealership is solely responsible for the brakes if they were defective when the car was sold. However, the passage does not provide any information about the condition of the brakes when the car was sold. The passage only states that the brakes failed after the car was driven more than 1,000 miles, but it does not specify whether the brakes were defective at the time of sale.\n\nB. **Yes, because the dealership is strictly liable for defective repairs on cars it has sold.**\n   - This option implies that the dealership is strictly liable for any defects in repairs made on the car. However, the passage does not provide any information about the specific nature of the repairs made by the mechanic. It only states that the mechanic fixed the brakes and then told the purchaser that the problem was fixed. There is no indication that the mechanic was negligent or that the repairs were defective.\n\nC. **No, because the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles.**\n   - This option suggests that the car's mileage is irrelevant to the dealership's liability. However, the passage does state that the car was driven more than 1,000 miles, which could be interpreted as a factor in the car's condition. If the car was driven more than 1,000 miles, it could be argued that the brakes were worn out or had other issues that contributed to the failure.\n\nD. **No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes.**\n   - This option suggests that the dealership's employee's negligence could be a factor in the claim. However, the passage does not provide any information about the employee's actions or negligence. It only states that the mechanic fixed the brakes and then told the purchaser that the problem was fixed.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles.**\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine whether the brakes were defective when the car was sold or whether the mechanic was negligent in repairing the brakes."
