A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nA. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nD. Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n"

                    "text": "The pedestrian's lawsuit against the appliance store for negligence is likely to be successful, even though the store argues that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Assumption of Risk**: The pedestrian clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area. This is a common defense in negligence cases, where the plaintiff has voluntarily exposed themselves to the risk of harm.\n\n2. **Trespass**: The pedestrian was not trespassing in the traditional sense. He was not entering the store's property or any other private area. He was simply walking through the public alleyway where the store was unloading its trucks.\n\n3. **Chain of Causation**: The chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road. The store's negligence in not warning the pedestrian about the danger and the pedestrian's failure to exercise reasonable care in avoiding the area are all part of the chain of causation.\n\n4. **Signs and Warning**: There were no warning signs or warning of unloading trucks, which is a significant factor in the store's defense. The store's failure to provide adequate warning is a key element of its defense.\n\nGiven these points, the pedestrian is likely to survive the store's motion to dismiss the lawsuit for damages. The store's defense relies on the assumption of risk and the foreseeability of the accident, which are both supported by the facts of the case."
