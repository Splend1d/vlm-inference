                    "text": "The owner of a drug store hired an independent contractor to renovate the store. Among other things, the renovations included installing a new front door made of plate glass. The contractor purchased the door from a glass door company. The sales representative of the glass door company told the contractor and the owner that plate glass was \"super safe\" and could withstand considerable pressure. The contractor installed the door, completed the other renovation work, and the store reopened for business later that same month. A few weeks later, a shopper and her 9-year- old son went to the drug store to purchase some merchandise. As they approached the store, the son was skipping ahead of his mother. Until he was within a few steps of the door, he thought it was open. When he realized it was, in fact, closed, he slowed down and, while still \"going faster than walking,\" pushed his hand against the handle to push open the door. His hand slipped off the handle and, at the same time, there was a \"kind of exploding noise. \" Due to a defect, the glass shattered and broke, cutting the son's hand and wrist. A subsequent inspection revealed that the glass door had been negligently installed by the contractor. If the shopper, on behalf of her son, asserts a claim against the glass door company based on strict products liability, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the glass door was defective.\nB. prevail, because the sales representative represented the plate glass as being \"super safe. \"\nC. not prevail, because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door.\nD. not prevail, because the son negligently pushed open the glass door.\n"

This negligence is a key factor in the case. The glass door company's sales representative, while not directly negligent, still failed to adequately inform the contractor about the potential risks associated with plate glass.\n\n2. **Defect**: The glass door was installed negligently, which means it was not installed according to the manufacturer's instructions or standards. This defect is a direct cause of the son's injury.\n\n3. **Strict Products Liability**: Strict products liability is a legal doctrine that holds the manufacturer or seller of a defective product liable for any harm caused by the product. In this case, the glass door company is liable for the son's injury because the glass door was installed negligently.\n\nTherefore, the son's claim against the glass door company will likely be upheld based on strict products liability, as the contractor's negligence is the primary cause of the son's injury."
