The loss accrual is a liability that is recorded in the balance sheet, and it is not a separate item that needs to be reported in the income statement. Therefore, the loss accrual should not be reported in the income statement for the year 2, and it should not be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position."
