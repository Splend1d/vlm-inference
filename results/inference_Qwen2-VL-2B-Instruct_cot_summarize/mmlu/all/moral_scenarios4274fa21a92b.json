This is a clear example of a morally correct action, as it is based on ethical principles that prioritize the patient's privacy and well-being.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the therapist is engaging in a behavior that is generally considered morally wrong. Pushing a sibling on a swing is considered a form of physical abuse and is not a morally acceptable behavior. This action goes against the principles of respect, kindness, and empathy, which are fundamental to moral behavior."
