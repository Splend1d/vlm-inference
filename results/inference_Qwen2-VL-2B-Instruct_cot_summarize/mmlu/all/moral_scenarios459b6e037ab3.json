The character's friend insisted on driving home, and the character did not resist or refuse the request. This is considered a form of complicity in a crime, as the character's refusal to stop the friend from driving could have prevented the crime from occurring.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did not do anything clearly morally wrong. The character wanted to pass the test and recited the answers in their head, which is a common practice in many educational settings. This is not considered a morally wrong action, as it is a common and accepted practice in many educational environments."
