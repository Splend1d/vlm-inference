She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen. She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support. She has a 6-month-old child and lives with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has never been married and does not work or attend school. She has no other symptoms. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem?\n\nA. Accept the girl's consent as sufficient\nB. Obtain a court order permitting evaluation\nC. Obtain the written consent of at least two licensed physicians\nD. Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents\n"
