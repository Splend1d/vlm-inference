                    "text": "A company incorporated and headquartered in State A sued a plumber domiciled in State B in a federal court in State A, alleging that the plumber had negligently installed pipes in a manner that resulted in $250,000 in damage to the company's headquarters building. In response to the complaint, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action. Sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the company asked the clerk to enter default, and the clerk did so. The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n"

                    "text": "The court's decision to enter a default judgment and then grant a motion to set aside the judgment is a complex legal issue that requires careful analysis. Let's break down the key points and evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Nature of the Default Judgment**: The court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought by the company. This means that the court found that the plumber was liable for the damages and ordered the plumber to pay the full amount without the need for a trial or further proceedings.\n\n2. **Notice of the Hearing**: The company applied for the entry of a default judgment three days before the hearing. This indicates that the company had ample notice of the hearing and the opportunity to respond to the default judgment.\n\n3. **Motion to Set Aside**: The plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. This motion is typically made within a certain period after the default judgment is entered, usually 21 days. The plumber did not file this motion within this period, which means the court has no reason to grant the motion.\n\n4. **Jurisdiction**: The court denied the plumber's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. This means that the court has jurisdiction over the plumber, and the court has the authority to enter a default judgment and set aside the judgment if the plumber fails to respond to the default judgment.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment because the plumber did not file a timely motion to set aside the judgment within the required period. This lack of timely response to the default judgment is a critical factor in determining whether the court should grant the motion to set aside the judgment.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action."
