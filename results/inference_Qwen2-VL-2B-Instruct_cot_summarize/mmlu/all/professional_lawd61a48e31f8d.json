The city's agent got a commitment from a major business corporation to build a large research center in the targeted area, which would bring new jobs and increased tax revenue. The city brought eminent domain proceedings to free up some 200 acres of land in the selected area. Although the city successfully condemned most of the privately-owned properties, it failed to reach agreement with nine residential property owners. Those owners brought suit seeking an injunction to prevent the taking. They claimed that this was not a taking for \"public use\" as required by the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment; rather the government was taking their property to give it to a private company. The case reached the Supreme Court of the United States. What will the Supreme Court decide?\n\nA. The taking for economic development purposes is proper because developing the city's economy constitutes a public use.\nB. The taking is improper because the major benefit will go to a private company and this contradicts the public use requirement.\nC. The taking would primarily increase the business corporation's profit margins, which is insufficient to support the public use requirement.\nD. The taking is improper because a private industry research center is not primarily open to the public's use.\n"

The Supreme Court will likely rule that the taking is not for \"public use\" as required by the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, which means that the taking is not justified by the public interest in the area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The taking is improper because the major benefit will go to a private company and this contradicts the public use requirement."
