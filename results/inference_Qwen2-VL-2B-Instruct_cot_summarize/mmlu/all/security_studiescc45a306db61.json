In their rejection of class orientated political interaction, HM scholars refer to wealth instead as the accumulation or access to physical resources, coining the term materialism to describe this approach.\n\nHistorical Materialism (HM) is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily in the United Kingdom, and is characterized by a focus on the role of material factors in the development of societies and the ways in which social structures change. The term \"materialism\" in this context refers to the rejection of class-oriented political interaction and the emphasis on the accumulation or access to physical resources as the basis for social change. This approach is distinct from the postmodern schools of thought, which often emphasize the role of culture and ideology in shaping social structures."
