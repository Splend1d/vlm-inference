During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?\n\nA. No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.\nB. No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.\nC. Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\nD. Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.\n"

The prosecution presented the facts that the wife was unhappy in her marriage and that the husband became abusive and violent. The wife hired a hit man to kill her husband, and the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. The defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self-defense under the battered women's syndrome. This instruction would be improper because the prosecution presented evidence that the wife was the victim of spousal abuse and that she was the one who hired the hit man to kill her husband. The prosecution's evidence shows that the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable. Therefore, the judge should not instruct the jury that the wife acted in self-defense under the battered women's syndrome. The correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable."
