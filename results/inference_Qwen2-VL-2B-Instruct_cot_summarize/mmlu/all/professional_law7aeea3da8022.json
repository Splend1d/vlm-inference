S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to \"dirty tricks\" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.\nB. prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.\nC. not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no \"false light. \"\nD. not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.\n"

The lawyer is now asserting a claim of invasion of privacy against the journalist. To determine the outcome, we need to analyze the legal implications of the journalist's actions.\n\n1. **Understanding the Nature of the Claim:**\n   - The lawyer claims that the journalist's publication of private information constitutes an invasion of his right to privacy.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n   - **Option A: prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.**\n     - This option suggests that the journalist's actions were illegal. However, the journalist did not break into the lawyer's private office or engage in any illegal activity. The journalist obtained the information through a lawful process (copying letters). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n   - **Option B: prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.**\n     - This option suggests that the publication was not newsworthy, which would mean it was not newsworthy enough to be published. However, the journalist's publication was not based on the lawyer's newsworthiness but rather on the private information he obtained. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n   - **Option C: not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no \"false light.\"**\n     - This option suggests that the journalist's publication was true and did not create a false impression. However, the journalist's publication was not based on the lawyer's truthfulness but rather on the private information he obtained. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n   - **Option D: not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.**\n     - This option suggests that the journalist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice. However, the journalist did engage in the burglary and conspired with the apprentice. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Option D: not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.**\n\nThus, the lawyer will most likely not prevail because the journalist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary."
