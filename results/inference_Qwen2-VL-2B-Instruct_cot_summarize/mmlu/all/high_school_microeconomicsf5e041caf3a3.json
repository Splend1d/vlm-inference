Wage = Marginal product of labor.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive labor market, the wage rate is determined by the market demand for labor, which is equal to the market supply of labor. The wage rate is equal to the marginal product of labor, which is the additional output produced by hiring one more unit of labor. Therefore, the wage rate is equal to the marginal product of labor, which is the highest rate at which the firm can produce additional output."
