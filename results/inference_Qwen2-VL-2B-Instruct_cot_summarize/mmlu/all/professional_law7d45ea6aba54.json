At an intersection, she could not stop for a red light and went into the intersection, where she slipped off the bike. While attempting to remount it, a car coming into the intersection with a green light ran her over, causing severe injuries. The car driver was distracted by his cell phone and received a careless driving ticket from the police. The woman filed a claim for damages, asserting that the car driver was negligent per se. She claimed that a finding of negligence per se prevented the driver from asserting comparative negligence under a state statute. Will the trial court likely grant the woman's motion to preclude the man's attempted comparative negligence defense?\n\nA. Yes, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law.\nB. Yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted.\nC. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.\nD. No, because she entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger, and she assumed the risk.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the application of negligence per se and comparative negligence laws in a scenario where a driver was involved in an accident. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Negligence Per Se**: This doctrine applies when a defendant is found to be totally at fault for an accident, leading to a presumption of negligence. The doctrine is typically used when the defendant's conduct was so reckless that it can be inferred that they were not acting with reasonable care.\n\n2. **Comparative Negligence**: This doctrine allows for the assessment of fault based on the defendant's conduct relative to the plaintiff's conduct. It is used when the defendant's conduct was not the sole cause of the accident but was contributory.\n\nGiven the scenario described, the woman claims that the car driver was negligent per se, arguing that the driver's conduct was so reckless that it precluded the driver from asserting comparative negligence. The key points are:\n\n- The woman claims that the driver's conduct was so reckless that it precluded the driver from asserting comparative negligence.\n- The car driver was distracted by his cell phone and received a careless driving ticket, indicating that the driver was not acting with reasonable care.\n\nThe key point here is that the woman is asserting that the driver's conduct was so reckless that it precluded the driver from asserting comparative negligence. This is because the doctrine of negligence per se applies when the defendant is found to be totally at fault, leading to a presumption of negligence.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident, which abrogates the comparative negligence law. This is not correct because the doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate comparative negligence; rather, it applies to total negligence.\n\n- **Option B**: This option states that negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted. This is incorrect because negligence per se does not preclude comparative negligence; it only applies to total negligence.\n\n- **Option C**: This option states that the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute. This is correct because the doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate comparative negligence; it applies to total negligence.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the woman entered the intersection knowing it was a red light, thereby putting herself voluntarily and knowingly in danger, and she assumed the risk. This is incorrect because the woman is claiming that the driver's conduct was so reckless that it precluded the driver from asserting comparative negligence.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the common law doctrine of negligence per se does not abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute.**"
