One day, the husband had been drinking beer while watching football on television. After his favorite team lost a close game, the husband went into a violent rage. As he was storming around the apartment, he suddenly grabbed his wife and led her outside to their car. He then ordered her to get inside the vehicle. The husband was driving around aimlessly when he negligently collided with another car. The other driver, who was injured in the accident, brought suit against the husband to recover damages. Thereafter, the husband retained an attorney to represent him. At his first consultation with the attorney, the husband was accompanied by his wife. During the conference, the attorney's secretary took notes of the meeting. Two weeks later, the wife separated from the husband. She then hired a lawyer to represent her in a suit against the husband for battery and false imprisonment. At the trial between the husband and the other driver, the other driver's attorney calls the wife to testify. She proposes to testify that her husband was intoxicated at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible as a proper lay opinion.\nB. inadmissible, under the attorney-clientprivilege.\nC. inadmissible, under the marital privilege.\nD. inadmissible, because the wife is biased.\n"

                    "text": "C. inadmissible, under the marital privilege.\n\nThe marital privilege is a legal doctrine that protects the privacy of a married couple from being compelled to testify against each other in civil litigation. This privilege is generally invoked when a spouse is called as a witness in a case involving their spouse. In this case, the wife is being called as a witness against her husband in a battery and false imprisonment case. The husband's attorney would likely argue that the wife's testimony is inadmissible under the marital privilege because it would be a direct attack on the husband's credibility and would be prejudicial to his case. Therefore, the wife's proposed testimony would most likely be inadmissible under the marital privilege."
