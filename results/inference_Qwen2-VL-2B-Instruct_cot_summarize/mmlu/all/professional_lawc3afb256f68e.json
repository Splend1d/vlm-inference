The first brother handed the deed to the second brother with instructions to take the deed to their lawyer for approval prior to delivery. Brother two, without his brother's permission, took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price. Is this a good deed as to partner one?\n\nA. No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\nB. Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.\nC. Yes, the deed was signed by both partners, which proved their intent to sell to buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by the fact of affixing their signatures to the document.\nD. No, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because partner two stepped outside his scope of authority.\n"

No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Signatory Authority**: The deed was signed by both brothers, indicating their intent to sell the land to the buyer. This is a valid indication of their intent to sell.\n\n2. **Delivery to the Buyer**: The deed was delivered to the buyer without the consent of partner one. Partner one did not participate in the delivery process and did not intend to deliver the deed to the buyer.\n\n3. **Agent's Authority**: Partner two took the deed directly to the buyer without partner one's consent. Partner two was acting as an apparent agent for partner one, but this does not change the fact that partner one did not intend to deliver the deed.\n\n4. **Validity of the Deed**: The deed was signed by both partners, which is a valid indication of their intent to sell. However, the fact that the deed was delivered without partner one's consent means that the deed cannot bind partner one.\n\nTherefore, the deed cannot bind partner one because partner two acted outside his scope of authority, which is not a valid reason for invalidating the deed."
