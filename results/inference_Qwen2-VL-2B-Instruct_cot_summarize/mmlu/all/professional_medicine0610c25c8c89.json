Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Bedside compartment pressure measurements\nB. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity\nC. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy\nD. Intraoperative angiography\n"

Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity\n\nThis is because the patient has developed increasing pain in his left foot, which could be indicative of a thrombus or other vascular complication. Doppler ultrasonography is a non-invasive test that can help diagnose and monitor blood flow in the lower extremities, which is crucial in identifying potential complications after vascular surgery."
