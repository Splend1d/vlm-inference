The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. Is the son's ownership interest enforceable in the face of the claim by the two non-selling sisters that they own 100% of the property pursuant to the law regarding joint tenancies?\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n"

Each tenant has an undivided interest in the property, and the property is held in the name of all the tenants as a whole. The joint tenants have the right to dispose of the property as a whole, and the property is subject to the joint tenants' joint liabilities.\n\n2. **Deed Recital**: The deed conveyed the title to the property to the three sisters \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" This indicates that the sisters were joint tenants with the right of survivorship, meaning they owned the property as a whole and had the right to dispose of it jointly.\n\n3. **Sister's Conveyance**: One of the sisters conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. This was a transfer of a one-third interest in the property.\n\n4. **Third Party's Death and Will**: The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. This is a testamentary transfer of the one-third interest.\n\n5. **Joint Tenancy and Will**: The will created a joint tenancy between the third party and her son, with the son taking a one-third interest in the property.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n- **Option A**: \"No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\"\n  - This option is incorrect because the deed conveyed the title to the property to the sisters as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, not as tenants in common. This means they owned the property as a whole and had the right to dispose of it jointly.\n\n- **Option B**: \"Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\"\n  - This option is incorrect because the deed conveyed the title to the property to the sisters as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, not as tenants in common. This means they owned the property as a whole and had the right to dispose of it jointly.\n\n- **Option C**: \"Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\"\n  - This option is incorrect because the deed conveyed the title to the property to the sisters as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, not as tenants in common. This means they owned the property as a whole and had the right to dispose of it jointly.\n\n- **Option D**: \"No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\"\n  - This option is incorrect because the deed conveyed the title to the property to the sisters as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, not as tenants in common. This means they owned the property as a whole and had the right to dispose of it jointly.\n\n**Conclusion**: The correct answer is **Option A**: \"No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\""
