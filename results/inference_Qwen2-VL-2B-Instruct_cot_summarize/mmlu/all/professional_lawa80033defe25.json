A protestor organized a demonstration against federal governmental support to rebels in a foreign country. The rally took place in a city park, and attracted about 100 supporters. During the rally, the protestor delivered a speech to the attendees. At the conclusion of his speech, the protestor said, \"I'm sick and tired of the garbage this administration is getting away with. Here's what I think about its policy of rebel aid . . . \" At which point, the protestor walked over to a trash can and dumped its contents on the ground. As the crowd cheered wildly, the protestor shouted, \"No more rebel aid . . . let's stop this garbage now!\" After littering the park, the protestor and his supporters left without picking up the trash. As a matter of constitutional law, may the protestor be prosecuted under the aforementioned city ordinance for littering the public park?\n\nA. No, because littering the park in these circumstances could be construed as symbolic speech and, thus, it is protected from government regulation by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nB. No, because the facts do not indicate that the protestor's actions presented a clear and present danger that was likely to produce or incite imminent lawless action, thereby necessitating an abridgment of his freedom of speech.\nC. Yes, because the city ordinance advances an important and legitimate public interest and is not directed at the suppression of communication.\nD. Yes, because littering the park is conduct, not speech and, therefore, it may not be treated by the law as communication.\n"

However, the city ordinance is directed at littering in public parks, not symbolic speech. The protestor's actions are not symbolic speech but rather littering.\n\nB. **No, because the facts do not indicate that the protestor's actions presented a clear and present danger that was likely to produce or incite imminent lawless action, thereby necessitating an abridgment of his freedom of speech.**\n   - This option suggests that the protestor's actions did not present a clear and present danger. However, the city ordinance is not concerned with the danger or imminent lawless action; it is concerned with littering in public parks.\n\nC. **Yes, because the city ordinance advances an important and legitimate public interest and is not directed at the suppression of communication.**\n   - This option suggests that the city ordinance is directed at a legitimate public interest and not at suppression of communication. However, the city ordinance is not directed at suppression of communication but rather at littering in public parks.\n\nD. **Yes, because littering the park is conduct, not speech and, therefore, it may not be treated by the law as communication.**\n   - This option suggests that littering is conduct and not speech, which is not the case here. The city ordinance is directed at littering in public parks, not conduct.\n\nGiven the analysis, the protestor's actions are not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments as they are not symbolic speech. The city ordinance is directed at littering in public parks, not symbolic speech. Therefore, the protestor may be prosecuted under the city ordinance for littering the public park.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. Yes, because littering the park is conduct, not speech and, therefore, it may not be treated by the law as communication."
