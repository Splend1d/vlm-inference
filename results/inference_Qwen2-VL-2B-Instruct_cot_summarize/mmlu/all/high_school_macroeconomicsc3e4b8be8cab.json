The GDP Deflator is a measure of the average change over time in the purchasing power of money.\n\nII. It is an alternative to the CPI.\n   - This statement is true. The GDP Deflator is indeed an alternative to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the average change in the prices of a basket of goods and services purchased by urban consumers.\n\nIII. It is more accurate than the CPI.\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. The GDP Deflator and the CPI are both measures of inflation, but they have different methodologies and assumptions. The GDP Deflator is based on the production of goods and services, while the CPI is based on the prices of a basket of goods and services. The accuracy of each measure depends on the specific data and assumptions used.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. I and II are true."
