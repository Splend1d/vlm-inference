It contradicts the hypothesis that the development of monumental construction among the Maya was an internal process.\n\nThe timing of monumental construction at Ceibal, which is a large Maya city located in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico, is significant because it challenges the hypothesis that the Maya were primarily influenced by the Olmec. The Olmec civilization, which flourished in what is now northern Mexico, is known for its large and elaborate stone structures, including pyramids and temples. However, the construction of Ceibal, which is much larger and more complex than any Olmec structure, suggests that the Maya were capable of building monumental structures independently. This contradicts the idea that the Maya were primarily influenced by the Olmec and supports the hypothesis that the development of monumental construction among the Maya was an internal process."
