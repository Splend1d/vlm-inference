The woman purchased an owner's policy of title insurance before the an owner's policy of title insurance before the closing. Because of an error by the title insurance company, the title commitment and title policy failed to list a county tax lien encumbering the lot as an exception to coverage. Last year, the woman conveyed the lot for a bargain price by a quitclaim deed to a friend, who paid cash, did not conduct a title search, and did not purchase title insurance. Subsequently, the county began proceedings to foreclose the tax lien, and the friend filed a claim with the woman's title insurance company, demanding that the company reimburse her for the tax lien amount. Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?\n\nA. No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\nB. No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.\nC. Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\nD. Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n"

Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Title Insurance Policy**: The title insurance policy is a contract between the title insurance company and the insured (the woman). The policy covers the woman for any defects in the title of the lot, including any county tax liens. The policy is valid until the policy expires, which is typically 10 years after the conveyance date.\n\n2. **Title Commitment and Title Policy**: The title commitment and title policy are separate documents that list the title of the lot. The title commitment is a legal document that lists the title of the lot, while the title policy is a contract that covers the title of the lot.\n\n3. **Title Policy Expiration**: The title policy is valid until it expires. If the title policy expires before the conveyance date, the title insurance company is not obligated to cover the woman for any defects in the title of the lot.\n\n4. **Title Policy Coverage**: The title policy covers defects in the title of the lot, including any county tax liens. If the title policy does not list the tax lien as an exception, the title insurance company is not obligated to cover the woman for the tax lien.\n\n5. **Title Insurance Company's Obligation**: The title insurance company is not obligated to cover the woman for the tax lien if the title policy does not list the tax lien as an exception. However, if the title policy does list the tax lien as an exception, the title insurance company is obligated to cover the woman for the tax lien.\n\n6. **Title Policy Expiration and Title Insurance Company's Obligation**: If the title policy expires before the conveyance date, the title insurance company is not obligated to cover the woman for any defects in the title of the lot. However, if the title policy is valid, the title insurance company is obligated to cover the woman for any defects in the title of the lot.\n\nIn this case, the title policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend, and the title insurance company is not obligated to cover the woman for the tax lien because the title policy expired. Therefore, the title insurance company is not obligated to pay the friend's claim.\n\nThe correct answer is D. Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss."
