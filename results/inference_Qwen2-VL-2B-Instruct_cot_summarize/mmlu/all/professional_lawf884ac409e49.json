On the software's web page, she clicked a \"download\" button and downloaded the product successfully. She did that without seeing or clicking to any information about the software's contractual licensing terms. If she had first scrolled down to the next visible screen, she would have seen the following invitation: \"Please review and agree to the licensing terms of this software program.\" She used the program for several months until she discovered that it was applying tracking technology to surreptitiously send dozens of third-party promotional offers to her clients. The company ignored her requests to stop doing this. She sued it to stop the unauthorized tracking but the company responded by citing to its licensing terms which require all disputes be submitted to private arbitration. Will the federal district court likely dismiss the web designer's complaint and order arbitration as required by the software licensing terms?\n\nA. Yes, because the designer got the benefit of the program and it required compliance with its licensing terms.\nB. No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.\nC. Yes, because the terms were obvious enough for anyone to find and she would have seen the notation if she had looked in a reasonable manner.\nD. No, because contracts formed online must be signed and executed with the same formality as paper contracts.\n"

However, the key issue here is that the user did not have clear notice that they must accept the terms before using the software.\n   - **Option B: No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.**\n     - This option correctly identifies the issue: the user did not receive sufficient notice that they must accept the terms before using the software. This is crucial because the terms require compliance with the software's licensing terms.\n   - **Option C: Yes, because the terms were obvious enough for anyone to find and she would have seen the notation if she had looked in a reasonable manner.**\n     - This option suggests that the terms were clear and obvious to anyone who looked at them. However, the key issue here is that the terms were not clear and obvious to the user who downloaded and used the software without seeing them.\n   - **Option D: No, because contracts formed online must be signed and executed with the same formality as paper contracts.**\n     - This option suggests that the terms must be signed and executed in the same manner as paper contracts. However, the key issue here is that the terms were not signed and executed in the same manner as paper contracts.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The web designer did not receive sufficient notice that she must accept the terms before using the software. Therefore, the terms require compliance with the software's licensing terms, and the federal district court is likely to dismiss the web designer's complaint and order arbitration as required by the software licensing terms.\n\n**Final Answer: B. No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.**"
