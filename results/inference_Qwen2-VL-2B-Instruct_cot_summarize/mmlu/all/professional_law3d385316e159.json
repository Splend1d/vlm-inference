An elderly woman, who was worried about her failing health, had heard that the fortuneteller was clairvoyant and could see into the future. Consequently, the woman decided to see the fortuneteller in order to have her Tarot cards read. As the fortuneteller was telling the woman her fortune, she suddenly said, \"I have a vision. If you give me $25,000 tomorrow, you will live to be 100 years old. \" The woman, who was 72 years of age, believed the fortuneteller and gave her the money the next day. The following week, the woman's physician informed her that she had a serious heart disease and he didn't expect her to live for more than a year or two. If the woman asserts a claim against the fortuneteller based on deceit, the plaintiff should\n\nA. prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.\nB. prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.\nC. not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties.\nD. not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed.\n"

Here's a detailed analysis of each option:\n\nA. **prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.**\n   - This option suggests that the plaintiff should prevail because she relied on the fortune teller's prediction, which was false. This is a strong argument, but it is not the only factor. The plaintiff also had a fiduciary relationship with the fortune teller, which could also be a factor in determining the outcome.\n\nB. **prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.**\n   - This option suggests that the plaintiff should prevail if the fortune teller did not genuinely believe the woman would live to be 100 years old. This is a strong argument, but it is not the only factor. The plaintiff also had a fiduciary relationship with the fortune teller, which could also be a factor in determining the outcome.\n\nC. **not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties.**\n   - This option suggests that the plaintiff should not prevail unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties. This is a strong argument, but it is not the only factor. The plaintiff also had a fiduciary relationship with the fortune teller, which could also be a factor in determining the outcome.\n\nD. **not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed.**\n   - This option suggests that the plaintiff should not prevail unless the fortune teller warranted the truth as believed. This is a strong argument, but it is not the only factor. The plaintiff also had a fiduciary relationship with the fortune teller, which could also be a factor in determining the outcome.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most comprehensive and strong argument is that the plaintiff should prevail because the fortune teller made a false prediction, which led to the plaintiff's financial loss. This is the most direct and logical basis for the plaintiff to assert a claim against the fortune teller.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**A. prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.**"
