Identity defines actors, and tells us who they are, what their preferences and interests are, and how those preferences might inform their actions.\nB. Identity is of fundamental importance to the social constructivist perspective because it is the basest principle in defining behaviour; it is a naturally bestowed quality comprised of certain unalterable behavioural characteristics.\nC. The identities, interests and behaviour of political agents are socially constructed by shared ideas, collective meaning, and interpretations and assumptions about the world.\nD. Actors form their identity through interaction, which in turn defines the types of relationship formed between these actors.\n"

Social constructivism emphasizes the social construction of identity, which means that identities are not fixed or unchangeable but are constructed through social interaction and shared meanings. It does not focus on the idea that identity is a natural, unchangeable quality."
