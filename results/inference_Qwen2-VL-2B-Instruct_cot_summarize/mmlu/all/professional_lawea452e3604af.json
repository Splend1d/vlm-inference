As part of the divorce decree, the wife was given custody of the son, while the husband was entitled to weekend visitation. Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence. As a consequence, the attorney advised the husband that he could take the son to live with him and not be in violation of the law. This was erroneous legal advice, and his new state, in fact, did honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. When his next scheduled visitation took place, the husband picked up his son at his ex-wife's home. Instead of returning his son, he took him to live with him in his new state. After refusing to return his son to his ex-wife, the husband was subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping. The applicable statute is defined as \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location. \"Should the husband be found guilty of kidnapping?\n\nA. Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.\nB. Yes, because mistake of law is no defense.\nC. No, because he lacked the requisite state of mind.\nD. No, because he received erroneous legal advice.\n"

                    "text": "The husband's actions in this scenario are best analyzed under the lens of criminal law, specifically focusing on the definition of kidnapping and the application of the applicable statute.\n\n1. **Definition of Kidnapping**: According to the applicable statute, kidnapping involves knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location. This definition encompasses the act of physically moving the person from one place to another, regardless of the reason for the movement.\n\n2. **Applicable Statute**: The husband's actions of taking his son to live with him in his new state, even though he was advised by an attorney that his new state would not honor his divorce decree, fall under the definition of kidnapping. The key element here is the husband's knowledge that his actions were illegal and his intent to move the son to another state.\n\n3. **Mistake of Law**: The husband's attorney's advice that his new state would not honor his divorce decree is not a defense to the charge of kidnapping. The advice was erroneous, but it does not absolve the husband of his criminal responsibility.\n\n4. **State of Mind**: The husband's actions were not based on a lack of state of mind, but rather on his knowledge that his actions were illegal and his intent to move the son to another state.\n\nGiven these points, the husband's actions are best characterized as kidnapping, as he knowingly and intentionally moved his son to another state, violating the applicable statute.\n\n**Final Answer: A. Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.**"
