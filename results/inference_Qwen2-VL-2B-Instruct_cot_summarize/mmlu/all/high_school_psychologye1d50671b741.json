The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools on the same day.\n\nConfounding variables in research are those that influence the results but are not the primary focus of the study. In this case, the psychologist is comparing the performance of second-graders in two different schools (Antrim School and Barton School) on the same day. This means that the psychologist is controlling for the day of the week and time of day when the students are tested, which helps to isolate the effect of the schools themselves. Therefore, the confounding variable is the day of the week and time of day when the students are tested."
