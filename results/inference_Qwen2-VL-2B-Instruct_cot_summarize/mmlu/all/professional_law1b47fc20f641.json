Inexplicably, he gave a campaign speech at a school assembly that was filled with graphic stories and anecdotes about the imagined sexual adventures and prowess of certain teachers and students. Several teachers and students complained. The principal suspended him for five days and retracted the valedictorian honors. The student, with his parents, sued in federal court, seeking an injunction and damages based on denial of First Amendment free speech rights. The federal courts ruled for the student but the case came before the U.S. Supreme Court for final decision. Did the Supreme Court uphold the relief granted to the student?\n\nA. No, the school exercised its appropriate function of trying to restrict the use of vulgarity and offensive discourse in a high school setting where free speech may be limited.\nB. Yes, despite some inconvenience to teachers and students, the immature presentation must be tolerated in deference to the need to provide platforms for free speech to students.\nC. No, the student had no rights to free speech, especially considering the violent disruptions in the schools in recent years.\nD. Yes, in today's society sexual images and sexual humor is so intertwined into the fabric of society that it is something that has to be tolerated in the interest of free speech.\n"

The court found that the student's speech was protected by the First Amendment, even though it was considered offensive and vulgar. The court ruled that the school's suspension of the student was an improper exercise of its authority, and that the student's speech was protected by the First Amendment. The court also ruled that the school's attempt to limit the use of vulgarity and offensive discourse in a high school setting was not appropriate, and that the student's speech was not inherently offensive or vulgar. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No, the school exercised its appropriate function of trying to restrict the use of vulgarity and offensive discourse in a high school setting where free speech may be limited."
