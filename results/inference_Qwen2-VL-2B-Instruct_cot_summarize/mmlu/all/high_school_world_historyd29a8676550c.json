It emphasizes the importance of understanding, mindfulness, and purity in achieving this goal.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith\n- Sikhism is a religious movement that emerged in the 15th century in India. It is not mentioned in the passage, so this option is not relevant.\n\nB. The arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders\n- Islam was introduced to India by the Arab conquests in the 7th century. The passage does not mention the arrival of Islam, so this option is not relevant.\n\nC. The eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force\n- The passage does not discuss the eradication of traditional Hinduism. It focuses on the concept of enlightenment and the importance of understanding, mindfulness, and purity.\n\nD. The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts\n- The passage mentions the self, the body, the intellect, and the mind, and it discusses the importance of understanding and mindfulness. It does not specifically mention Buddhism, so this option is not relevant.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting change in Indian religious practice under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka would be:\n\nD. The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts\n\nThis option aligns with the passage's focus on the importance of understanding and mindfulness, which are central to Buddhist teachings."
