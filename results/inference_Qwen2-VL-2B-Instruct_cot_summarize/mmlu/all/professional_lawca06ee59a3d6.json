In this scenario, the defendant, while standing in front of the passenger, suddenly grabbed the pocketbook and tried to run away. This action constitutes an attempt to steal the pocketbook, which is a form of attempted larceny. The act of attempting to steal is considered a separate crime from the actual theft itself, and the defendant should be held accountable for the attempted theft."
