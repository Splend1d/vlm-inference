There were no palaces, public architecture, and little evidence for status differentiation.\n\nCatalhoyuk is a site of the Neolithic period, which is characterized by simple, communal living and a lack of monumental architecture or roads. The site is located in the central Anatolian region of Turkey and is known for its large, communal houses and the presence of numerous stone tools and other artifacts. While there may have been some evidence of status differentiation in the form of different types of houses and artifacts, the overall lack of monumental architecture and roads makes it difficult to classify Catalhoyuk as a city."
