The defendant's admission that he was indifferent to the consequences of his actions indicates a lack of intent to cause harm, which is not sufficient to establish the required intent for assault with the intent to cause serious bodily injury. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of assault with the intent to cause serious bodily injury."
