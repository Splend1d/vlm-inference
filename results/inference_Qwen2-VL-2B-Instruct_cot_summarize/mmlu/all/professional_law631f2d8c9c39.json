In this context, a joint tenancy is a legal arrangement where two or more people own property together, with each person having an equal share of the property. When a person dies, the property passes to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\n- This option suggests that the mortgage lien does not destroy the joint tenancy. However, it does not address the issue of whether the bank can execute on the mortgage lien when the property passes to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\n- This option suggests that the bank needs to obtain a deed of trust to execute on the property. However, the question asks about the bank's ability to execute on the mortgage lien, not the deed of trust.\n\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\n- This option suggests that the bank can execute on the mortgage lien because the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy. However, it does not address the issue of whether the bank can execute on the mortgage lien when the property passes to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n- This option suggests that the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust, and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage. This option directly addresses the issue of whether the bank can execute on the mortgage lien when the property passes to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nGiven the majority view on this issue, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage."
