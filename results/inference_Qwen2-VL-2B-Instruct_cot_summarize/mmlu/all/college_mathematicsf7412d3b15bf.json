The circle \\(C\\) is given by the equation \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\), which represents a circle in the yz-plane with its center at (3, 0, 0) and a radius of 1.\n\nWhen this circle is revolved around the z-axis, it generates a torus. The equation of a torus in the xz-plane (where the z-axis is the axis of revolution) can be found using the parametric equations for a torus, which are:\n\n\\[x = r \\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\\[y = r \\sin(\\theta)\\]\n\\[z = z_0 + r \\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius of the torus, and \\(z_0\\) is the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of revolution (in this case, the z-axis).\n\nGiven that the center of the torus is at (3, 0, 0), the radius \\(r\\) is 1, and the distance \\(z_0\\) is 3 (since the torus is revolved around the z-axis), we can substitute these values into the parametric equations to find the equation of the torus:\n\n\\[x = 1 \\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\\[y = 1 \\sin(\\theta)\\]\n\\[z = 3 + 1 \\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\nTo express this in the form of a single equation, we can use the trigonometric identity \\(\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1\\), which allows us to simplify the equation:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of the torus generated by revolving the circle \\(C\\) around the z-axis is:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 5\\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)\\)"
