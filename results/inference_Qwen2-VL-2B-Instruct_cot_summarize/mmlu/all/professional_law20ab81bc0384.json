This income tax exempts taxable income earned by city residents outside of the state. Moreover, residents of the city were not taxed on their in-city earned income. A commuter who works in the city but is a resident of a neighboring state, challenges the constitutionality of this statute. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIV.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

This clause provides that \"no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the commuter argues that the city's tax on nonresident's city derived income is discriminatory because it imposes a higher tax rate on nonresidents than on residents of the city. This is a violation of the equal protection clause, which guarantees that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV."
