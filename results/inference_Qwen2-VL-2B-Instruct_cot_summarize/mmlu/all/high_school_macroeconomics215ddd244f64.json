Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.\n\nIn the short run, nominal wages are sticky to price level changes, meaning they do not adjust quickly in response to changes in the price level. This leads to a vertical short-run aggregate supply curve. In contrast, in the long run, nominal wages are more responsive to price level changes, allowing for a downward sloping long-run aggregate supply curve."
