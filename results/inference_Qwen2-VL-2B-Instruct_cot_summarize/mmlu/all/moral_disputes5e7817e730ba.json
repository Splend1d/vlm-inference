However, we can infer that this percentage is likely to be higher than the overall percentage of capital cases.\n\n2. **Percentage of Capital Cases**: The overall percentage of capital cases is given as 82%.\n\n3. **Percentage of Overturned Cases**: The percentage of capital cases overturned because of serious errors is not provided directly. However, we can infer that this percentage is likely to be higher than the overall percentage of capital cases.\n\nGiven these points, we can calculate the overall percentage of capital cases overturned because of serious errors as follows:\n\n- Let's assume the percentage of capital cases overturned because of serious errors is \\( x \\).\n- The overall percentage of capital cases is 82%.\n\nThe formula to calculate the percentage of overturned cases is:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of overturned cases} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage of overturned cases}}{\\text{Overall percentage of capital cases}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{82}{100} \\times 100 = 82\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the overall percentage of capital cases overturned because of serious errors is 82%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 82 percent"
