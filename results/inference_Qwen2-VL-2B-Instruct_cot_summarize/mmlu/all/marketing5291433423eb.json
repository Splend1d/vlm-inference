All of the above.\n\nMarketers should consider the following emerging trends to better understand consumer lifecycles:\n\n1. **Fewer people are getting married**: This trend reflects a shift in societal norms and attitudes towards marriage, which can impact the timing and duration of the marriage stage in consumers' life cycles.\n2. **People getting married at a later age**: This trend suggests that consumers are delaying marriage, which can affect the duration of the marriage stage and the overall lifecycle of individuals.\n3. **More couples co-habiting**: This trend indicates a growing preference for alternative living arrangements, which can influence the duration and stability of the cohabitation stage in consumers' life cycles.\n4. **All of the above**: These trends collectively reflect the evolving nature of consumer lifecycles and the changing dynamics within them. Marketers should be prepared to adapt their strategies and products to accommodate these changes."
