                    "text": "An object released from rest falls under the influence of gravity, which is a constant force. The distance an object falls under the influence of gravity is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( d \\) is the distance fallen, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 on Earth), and \\( t \\) is the time in seconds.\n\nGiven that the object falls a distance \\( h \\) during the first second of time, we can substitute \\( t = 1 \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 1^2 \\]\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\]\n\\[ h = 4.9 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow, we want to find out how far the object will fall during the next second of time. We can use the same formula but with \\( t = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 2^2 \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ d = 4.9 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ d = 9.8 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the object will fall 9.8 meters during the next second of time. The correct answer is:\n\nD. 4h"
