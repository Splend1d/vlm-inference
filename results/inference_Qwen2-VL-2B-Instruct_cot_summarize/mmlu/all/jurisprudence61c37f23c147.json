His concept of status is misrepresented.\n\nThe aphorism \"the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract\" is often misunderstood because it is misinterpreted as a prediction. The phrase \"from Status to Contract\" is not a prediction but rather a description of a historical trend in the development of societies. It suggests that as societies progress, they tend to move from a system where individuals are bound by their status and obligations to one where they are free to contract with others and make their own decisions. This is a historical observation rather than a prediction about the future."
