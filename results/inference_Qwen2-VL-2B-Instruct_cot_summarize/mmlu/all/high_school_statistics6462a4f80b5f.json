The probability of the union of two events A and B, P(A \u222a B), does not necessarily imply that A and B are independent. Independence is a property of two events, not of the union of two events.\n\nB. P(A \u222a B) = 1 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n- This statement is false. The probability of the union of two events A and B, P(A \u222a B), being equal to 1 does not necessarily mean that A and B are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive events are those that cannot both occur at the same time, and the probability of their union being 1 implies that they are disjoint, but not necessarily that they are mutually exclusive.\n\nC. P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are independent.\n- This statement is false. The probability of the intersection of two events A and B, P(A \u2229 B), being equal to 0 does not necessarily imply that A and B are independent. Independence is a property of two events, not of the intersection of two events.\n\nD. P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n- This statement is true. If the probability of the intersection of two events A and B, P(A \u2229 B), is 0, it means that A and B are mutually exclusive. This is because mutually exclusive events cannot both occur at the same time, and the probability of their intersection being 0 implies that they are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive."
