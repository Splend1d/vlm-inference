If the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, which of the following is the most likely result?\n\nA. Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence\nB.

Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence\n\nIn a placebo-controlled clinical trial, the primary goal is to determine whether the new antihypertensive drug is more effective than standard therapy. The alpha level (\u03b1) is typically set at 0.05 to control for Type I errors (false positives), which are the results that are incorrectly attributed to the treatment group. If the alpha level is increased to 0.01, the study will have more power to detect a true difference between the groups, meaning it will be more likely to detect a statistically significant difference between the groups. This increased power allows for a more robust conclusion about the effectiveness of the new drug. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
