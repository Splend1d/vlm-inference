The example is about the rules of membership and settlement within a physical territory, not about the legal status of Central Park.\n\n2. **There is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory**: This is the point of the example. The yoga group's rules about membership (not allowing others to join) contrast with its rules about settlement within the park (allowing others to use the park). This illustrates that different rules apply to different aspects of a physical territory.\n\n3. **Territorial rights only belong to individuals**: This is not the point of the example. The example is about the rules of membership and settlement within a physical territory, not about the ownership of territorial rights.\n\n4. **Wellman is committed to an absurd theory of group membership**: This is not the point of the example. The example is about the rules of membership and settlement within a physical territory, not about the commitment of an individual to a theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. there is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory."
