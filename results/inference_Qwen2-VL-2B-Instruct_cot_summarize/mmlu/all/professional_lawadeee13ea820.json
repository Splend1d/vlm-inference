If the electrician's work was not done according to the usual practices and procedures, the homeowner may have a case for negligence or malpractice.\n\n2. **Defective Wiring**: If the homeowner can prove that the wiring became disjointed because of the electrician's negligence or lack of expertise, the homeowner may have a case for negligence or malpractice. This would require demonstrating that the electrician's actions were the direct cause of the disjointed wiring.\n\n3. **Professional Judgment**: The homeowner must also demonstrate that the electrician used his best professional judgment in performing the electrical work. If the electrician's judgment was flawed, the homeowner may have a case for negligence or malpractice.\n\n4. **Knowledge of Contractor\u2019s Hiring**: The homeowner must show that the homeowner knew or should have known that the contractor had hired the electrician to perform the electrical work. If the homeowner did not know or should not have known about the contractor's hiring, the homeowner may not have a case for negligence or malpractice.\n\nGiven these points, the homeowner's case will depend on the specific facts of the situation. If the electrician's actions were not in accordance with established industry standards and if the disjointed wiring was a direct result of the electrician's negligence, the homeowner may have a case for negligence or malpractice. However, if the electrician's actions were within the scope of his professional judgment and the disjointed wiring was not a result of negligence, the homeowner may not have a case for negligence or malpractice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, unless the electrical wiring that became disjointed was defective.**"
