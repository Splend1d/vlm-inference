The electric force, because the protons in the nuclei of the top atomic layer of the table repel the nuclei in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\nB. The gravitational force, because by F = GMm/r^2, the force of the table on the wood at that close range is sufficient to balance the force of the Earth on the wood.\nC. The electric force, because the outer electrons in the top atomic layer of the table repel the outer electrons in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\nD.

The table supports the wooden block by exerting a force on it due to the gravitational pull of the Earth. The gravitational force is a fundamental force that arises from the mass of the objects and their relative positions. In this case, the table is exerting a force on the wooden block due to the gravitational pull of the Earth, which is a result of the mass of the Earth and the distance between the table and the wooden block."
