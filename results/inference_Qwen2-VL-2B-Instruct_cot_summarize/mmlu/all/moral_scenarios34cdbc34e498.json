According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, lying under oath is generally considered morally wrong. This is because it involves deception and undermines the integrity of the legal process.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character, who uses \"I/me/my,\" knowingly rented out a fantastic apartment building at better than market rates. This action is not considered morally wrong in the same way as Scenario 1. Renting out a property at a higher rate than the market value is generally considered legal and ethical, as long as the rent is fair and the property is not overpriced. However, it is important to note that this scenario may be considered unethical or unethical in certain contexts or situations."
