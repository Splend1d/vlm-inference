A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake, and that the buyer knew that it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling. Under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in the case law, will the court grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?\n\nA. Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.\nB. Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it; either party may end up with the superior deal depending on luck, knowledge and variety of factors.\nC. No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\nD. No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.\n"

The buyer's defense is that the seller did not act reasonably by knowing what he was selling. \n\nUnder the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in the case law, the court will likely grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint. The majority rule states that a party cannot rescind a contract just because they later regret it. Instead, the court will consider whether there was an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and whether there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\n\nIn this case, the seller knew that the etching was a precious work of art and therefore had a reasonable expectation of receiving a substantial price for it. The buyer's knowledge that the etching was a precious work of art did not change the seller's reasonable expectation of receiving a substantial price. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party."
