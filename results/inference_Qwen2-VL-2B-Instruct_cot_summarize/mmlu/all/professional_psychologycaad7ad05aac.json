It is no longer a simple symbol of power or equity, but rather a tool that can be used to achieve a variety of goals and objectives. This complexity means that money can be a more unpredictable motivator, as people may not always know how to use it effectively or may not have a clear understanding of its value. Additionally, the role of money as a motivator can become more complex as people may have to consider a range of factors, such as their financial situation, the costs of different goals, and the potential consequences of different actions."
