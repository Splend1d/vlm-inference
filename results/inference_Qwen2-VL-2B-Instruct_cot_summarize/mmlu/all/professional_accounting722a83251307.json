The partnership assumed a $10,000 mortgage on the land.\n3. **Recourse Liabilities**: The partnership had $20,000 in recourse liabilities that would be shared by partners according to their partnership interests.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the basis of the land:\n\n- **Basis of Land**: $12,000 (basis) + $20,000 (fair market value) = $32,000\n- **Mortgage on Land**: $10,000 (mortgage)\n\nThe basis of the land is $32,000, and the mortgage is $10,000. Therefore, the basis of the land after accounting for the mortgage is:\n\n- **Basis of Land after Mortgage**: $32,000 - $10,000 = $22,000\n\nNext, let's calculate Skinner's basis in the partnership interest:\n\n- **Skinner's Contribution**: $5,000\n- **Partnership's Recourse Liabilities**: $20,000\n\nThe basis of the partnership interest is Skinner's contribution plus the partnership's recourse liabilities:\n\n- **Skinner's Basis in Partnership Interest**: $5,000 + $20,000 = $25,000\n\nTherefore, the amount that represents Skinner's basis in the partnership interest is $25,000.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. $19,000**."
