Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character, as a school bus driver, is making a clear moral decision by ensuring no child is in front of the bus when starting to drive. This action is generally considered morally right and responsible, as it protects children from potential harm.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character, who called the fire station because of a messy kitchen, is not making a clear moral decision. Calling the fire station for a kitchen issue is not a morally wrong action, as it is a common and necessary action to address a problem in one's home. However, it is not a morally right action, as it is not addressing the issue in a way that would prevent harm or inconvenience to others."
