This charge implies that the gun dealer and the friend agreed to commit a crime together, specifically bank robbery.\n\n2. **Nature of the Crime**: Bank robbery is a crime that involves the use of a firearm to rob a bank. The gun dealer and the friend were charged with conspiring to commit bank robbery, which means they agreed to commit a crime that involves the use of a firearm.\n\n3. **Foreseeability**: The government must prove that the gun dealer and the friend were aware that the friend was going to commit a crime, specifically bank robbery. This is a requirement for conspiracy to commit a crime.\n\n4. **Agreement**: The gun dealer and the friend must have agreed to commit the crime of bank robbery together. This agreement is a necessary element of conspiracy.\n\nGiven that the gun dealer and the friend were charged with conspiracy to commit bank robbery, it is reasonable to conclude that they agreed to commit the crime of bank robbery. Therefore, the charge of conspiracy to commit bank robbery can be upheld against the gun dealer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nB. Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime."
