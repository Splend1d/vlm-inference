If A is uncountable, then A = R.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- If A is uncountable, it means that A contains an infinite number of distinct elements. This implies that A cannot be finite, as a finite set would have a countable number of elements.\n- Since A contains each rational number, and the set of rational numbers is countable (because it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers), it follows that A must also be countable.\n- Therefore, A cannot be uncountable, which means A must be equal to the real line R.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because an open set in the real line can be uncountable, such as the set of all open intervals (0,1) or (0,1) itself.\n- Option B is incorrect because a closed set in the real line can be uncountable, such as the set of all rational numbers (which is uncountable).\n- Option D is incorrect because an uncountable set can be open, such as the set of all open intervals (0,1) or (0,1) itself."
