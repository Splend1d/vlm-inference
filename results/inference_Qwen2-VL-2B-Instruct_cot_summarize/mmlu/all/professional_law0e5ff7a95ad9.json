In 1997, the rancher conveyed the 200-acre tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my uncle, his heirs, and assigns, but if my uncle's wife dies without issue, to my personal assistant and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 200-acre tract, the uncle discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the personal assistant of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the personal assistant learned that the uncle was selling oil from the drilling operations. The personal assistant has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal. If the decision is in favor of the uncle, it will be based on the fact that\n\nA. the right to remove oil is an incident of a defeasible fee simple.\nB. the personal assistant has no interest in the 200-acre tract.\nC. there was no showing that the uncle acted in bad faith.\nD. the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n"

The right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n\nThis is because the uncle's right to remove oil from the 200-acre tract is an incident of the right to possession, which is a fee simple absolute. The right to possession is a fee simple absolute because it is absolute and unencumbered, and it is not subject to any limitations or restrictions. Therefore, the uncle has the right to remove oil from the tract without any notice or consent from the personal assistant."
