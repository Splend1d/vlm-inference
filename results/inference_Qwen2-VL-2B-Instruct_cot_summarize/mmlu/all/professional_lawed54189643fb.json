Following the acquittal, the victim's estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim's estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim's estate then asked the witness the following question, \"Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim's broken nose?\" The witness replied, \"Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, \u0080\u0098And that's only the beginning. \"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible, because it reports the defendant's adoptive admission of the victim's assertion.\nC. inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Hearsay is evidence that is not admissible in court unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions. In this case, the witness's testimony is hearsay because it is not a statement made in the course of a trial, and it is not a statement made by the defendant or a person who has a direct personal knowledge of the facts. Therefore, the witness's testimony is inadmissible. The correct answer is D."
