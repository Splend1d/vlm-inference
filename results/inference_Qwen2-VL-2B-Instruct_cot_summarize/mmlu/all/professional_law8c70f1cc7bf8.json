                    "text": "A company owns and operates a chemical plant that manufactures paraquat, an herbicide used primarily as a weed killer. The plant is located in a rural area in the southwestern part of the state. In its production of paraquat, the company emits putrid smelling fumes throughout the surrounding countryside. Although the fumes are harmless to health, they are rank and highly offensive. Despite extensive research by the company to alleviate the problem, there is no known way to manufacture paraquat without discharging malodorous fumes into the air. An owner of a large dairy farm that is adjacent to the plant finds the foul-smelling herbicide fumes to be extremely unpleasant and totally objectionable. The owner brings an action based on private nuisance against the company and seeks to enjoin the manufacture of paraquat at the chemical plant. Which of the following facts, if proven, will be most helpful to the company's defense?\n\nA. Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce paraquat.\nB. The company has a contract with the federal government whereby it supplies 80 percent of its paraquat production to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which uses the herbicide as a marijuana eradicator.\nC. The company commenced the manufacture of paraquat at the plant before the owner acquired the land and built his dairy farm.\nD. Paraquat is the only herbicide that can safely and effectively kill marijuana, which, if not controlled, poses a serious drug-enforcement problem.\n"

                    "text": "The company's defense in this case would likely focus on the fact that the herbicide paraquat is specifically designed for use as a weed killer and is not intended for use as a drug. The company argues that the herbicide is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the fumes from the plant are a byproduct of that intended use, not a deliberate attempt to harm the environment or the community.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce paraquat.**\n   - This fact is irrelevant to the company's defense. The approval of the design and equipment does not address the company's claim that paraquat is safe and effective for its intended purpose.\n\nB. **The company has a contract with the federal government whereby it supplies 80 percent of its paraquat production to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which uses the herbicide as a marijuana eradicator.**\n   - This fact is also irrelevant. The company's contract with the federal government does not impact the company's claim that paraquat is safe and effective for its intended purpose.\n\nC. **The company commenced the manufacture of paraquat at the plant before the owner acquired the land and built his dairy farm.**\n   - This fact is irrelevant. The company's claim that paraquat is safe and effective for its intended purpose does not depend on when the company began manufacturing the herbicide.\n\nD. **Paraquat is the only herbicide that can safely and effectively kill marijuana, which, if not controlled, poses a serious drug-enforcement problem.**\n   - This fact is most helpful to the company's defense. It establishes that paraquat is specifically designed for its intended purpose of weed control, which is a legitimate and necessary use. The company can argue that the fumes from the plant are a byproduct of this intended use, not a deliberate attempt to harm the environment or the community.\n\nTherefore, the most helpful fact for the company's defense is:\n\n**D. Paraquat is the only herbicide that can safely and effectively kill marijuana, which, if not controlled, poses a serious drug-enforcement problem.**"
