Vaccine has been developed\n\nParvoviruses are a group of viruses that cause a range of diseases in humans, including paroviral enteritis, paroviral pneumonia, and paroviral encephalitis. The paroviral enteritis is a common childhood illness that causes diarrhea and abdominal pain. The paroviral pneumonia is a serious illness that can cause respiratory failure and death. The paroviral encephalitis is a rare but serious illness that can cause brain damage and death.\n\nThe paroviruses are targeted for reduction of disease through the development of a vaccine. The vaccine is a live virus that is weakened or inactivated and is given to individuals who are at risk of contracting the virus. The vaccine is designed to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that can protect the individual from the virus. The vaccine is usually given as a single dose and is effective in preventing the disease."
