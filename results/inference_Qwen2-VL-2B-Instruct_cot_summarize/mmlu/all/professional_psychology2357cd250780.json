EQUITY THEORY states that people assess both their inputs and outcomes and compare the ratio to other workers.\n2. Overpayment has a greater impact on worker performance than underpayment.\n3. The focus is on fairness in the procedures used, not in the outcomes.\n\nGiven this information, PROCEDURAL JUSTICE is most closely associated with fairness in the procedures used, rather than fairness in outcomes or perceptions of outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. fairness of procedures"
