We know that the z-score is 1.5, and we want to find the final exam score (\\( X_{final} \\)) that corresponds to this z-score. We can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this value.\n\nLooking up the z-score of 1.5 in the standard normal distribution table, we find that the cumulative probability for a z-score of 1.5 is approximately 0.9358. This means that about 93.58% of the final exam scores fall below a z-score of 1.5.\n\nTo find the final exam score that corresponds to a z-score of 1.5, we calculate the final exam score as follows:\n\n\\[ X_{final} = \\mu_{final} + z_{midterm} \\sigma_{final} \\]\n\\[ X_{final} = 112 + 1.5 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ X_{final} = 112 + 15 \\]\n\\[ X_{final} = 127 \\]\n\nTherefore, the student must have scored 127 points on the final exam to have the same standardized score (z-score) as the student who scored 58 points on the midterm.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 127 points."
