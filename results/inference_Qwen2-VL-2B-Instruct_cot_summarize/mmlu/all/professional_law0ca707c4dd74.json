Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road. After the woman used the private road for approximately two months, a teacher who was an owner within the residential subdivision, ordered the woman to discontinue using the private road. In an appropriate action by the teacher against the woman to enjoin the use of the private road, the woman will\n\nA. win, because there is an easement by estoppel over the private road.\nB. win, because there is an implied easement appurtenant over the private road.\nC. lose, unless the private road is the only access road by which woman can gain ingress and egress to her property.\nD. lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.\n"

In this case, the developer had an easement by estoppel over the private road, which means the developer had the right to use the road for the benefit of the subdivision's owners. The homeowner, however, did not have an easement by estoppel over the private road because it was not a part of the developer's easement.\n\n2. **Implied Easement Appurtenant**: This doctrine allows an owner to have an easement over another owner's land if the owner has a right to use the land for the benefit of the owner. In this case, the developer had an implied easement appurtenant over the private road because the developer had the right to use the road for the benefit of the subdivision's owners. The homeowner did not have an implied easement appurtenant over the private road because it was not part of the developer's easement.\n\n3. **Legal Right to Travel**: The woman did not have a legal right to travel over the private road because it was not part of the developer's easement. The easement by estoppel over the private road was a right of the developer, not the homeowner.\n\nTherefore, the woman will lose the use of the private road because she does not have a legal right to travel over it."
