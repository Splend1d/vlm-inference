Mountain ranges in the north of Great Britain act as a barrier to cold winds blowing from the Arctic.\n\nThe climate of Great Britain is generally milder than that of other places along the same latitude due to the presence of the British Isles, which act as a barrier to cold winds from the Arctic. This is because the mountains in the north of Great Britain, such as the Cairngorms and the Lake District, act as a natural barrier to cold air, preventing it from reaching the southern parts of the country. This results in a more temperate climate compared to other regions with similar latitudes."
