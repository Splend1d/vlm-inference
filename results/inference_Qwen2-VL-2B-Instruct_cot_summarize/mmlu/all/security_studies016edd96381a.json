The next generation is likely to develop their arguments in engagements with policy questions and in direct interaction with policymakers and think tanks.\nB. Policy knowledge reflected in terms of theories, when an interaction emerges between the US and European thinkers, the theoretical context will be the same.\nC. The set up continues to be one in which security studies is located between the IR discipline and technical experts and practitioners.\nD. European security studies will be treated as a form of (policy) knowledge, whereas security theory in the US will treat this as the main empirical source for critical analysis.\n"

They have also emphasized the importance of non-state actors and the role of technology in shaping security.
