One evening, the guard saw a young man stealing a rake that a homeowner in the neighborhood had left outside in his yard. The guard ran toward the young man. Seeing the guard, the young man dropped the rake and began to flee. Believing that the young man was about to escape, the guard pulled out his gun and fired a shot at the young man. The bullet struck the young man in the arm. If the young man asserts a claim against the security company for damages for his injuries, the young man will\n\nA. prevail, because the guard used unreasonable force to protect the homeowner's property.\nB. prevail, because the guard did not give a warning that he had a gun and was about to shoot.\nC. not prevail, because the young man was trespassing on the homeowner's property.\nD. not prevail, because the young man was engaged in theft when he was shot.\n"

                    "text": "The young man asserts a claim against the security company for damages for his injuries. The key issue here is whether the guard's actions were justified under the circumstances.\n\n1. **Reasonable Force**: The guard's actions were reasonable under the circumstances. The guard was responding to a theft in progress, and the young man was attempting to flee. The guard's actions were justified in protecting the homeowner's property.\n\n2. **Warning**: The guard did not give a warning that he had a gun and was about to shoot. This is a critical point. The guard's failure to warn the young man could be considered negligence, but it does not necessarily absolve the guard of liability for the shooting.\n\n3. **Trespass**: The young man was not trespassing on the homeowner's property. The guard was patrolling the neighborhood, and the young man was on private property.\n\n4. **Injury**: The young man was injured by the guard's shooting. This is a direct consequence of the guard's actions, which were justified under the circumstances.\n\nGiven these points, the young man will likely prevail in his claim against the security company. The guard's actions were reasonable, and the guard did not give a warning that he had a gun and was about to shoot. The young man was not trespassing, and the guard's shooting was a direct result of the guard's actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. prevail, because the guard used reasonable force to protect the homeowner's property.**"
