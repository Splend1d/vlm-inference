E \u2283 F\n- This is not necessarily true because the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between E and F. The premises only state that ~E implies ~F, but not the converse.\n\nB. F \u2283 G\n- This is not necessarily true because the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between F and G. The premises only state that G is implied by F, but not the converse.\n\nC. H \u2283 ~E\n- This is not necessarily true because the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between H and ~E. The premises only state that H implies ~E, but not the converse.\n\nD. ~H\n- This is not necessarily true because the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between ~H and H. The premises only state that H implies ~E, but not the converse.\n\nE. ~I\n- This is not necessarily true because the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between ~I and I. The premises only state that I implies ~I, but not the converse.\n\nNone of the propositions listed in option A through E directly follow from the given premises without any additional steps. Therefore, none of these propositions are immediate consequences of the given premises.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nNone of the propositions listed in option A through E are immediate consequences of the given premises."
