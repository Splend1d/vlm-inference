The Moon was once entirely molten.\n\nThe Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that the Moon was formed by a massive impact event that caused the Moon to be significantly larger than the Earth. This hypothesis is supported by the relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth, the presence of a much smaller iron core, and the fact that most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface. However, the Moon's current state, being mostly solid and not molten, does not directly support the Giant Impact Hypothesis."
