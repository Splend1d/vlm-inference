Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?\n\nA.

The reasons given for the fall of the Roman Empire can also be applied to other classical empires, as they too experienced similar issues of corruption, relaxation of military discipline, and the pressure of Barbarian invasions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Tang and Ottoman - These empires were not classical empires; they are modern ones.\n\nB. Ming and Aztec - These empires were also modern ones, not classical.\n\nC. Han and Gupta - These empires were classical empires, and the reasons given for their decline are applicable to them.\n\nD. Qin and Etruscan - These empires were also classical empires, and the reasons given for their decline are applicable to them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Han and Gupta."
