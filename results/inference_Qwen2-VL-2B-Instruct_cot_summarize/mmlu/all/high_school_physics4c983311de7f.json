The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.\n\nAn ideal projectile launched at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the horizontal will experience constant vertical acceleration due to gravity, which is -9.8 m/s\u00b2. This constant acceleration causes the projectile to accelerate downward, resulting in a decreasing vertical speed. Conversely, on the way down, the projectile will experience constant horizontal acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s\u00b2. This constant acceleration causes the projectile to accelerate upward, resulting in an increasing vertical speed."
