The key point is that treating it as a single instance implies justifying the practice of torture, which is a significant concern.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. Justifying one instance of torture requires justifying the practice of torture.\n- This option aligns with Baron's argument. If treating the ticking bomb case as a single instance justifies the practice of torture, then it implies that the practice of torture is justified in general.\n\nB. It is virtually impossible for torture to be limited to just one instance.\n- This option is not directly relevant to the argument about treating the ticking bomb case as a single instance. It discusses the practicality of torture, which is not the focus of Baron's argument.\n\nC. Both A and B\n- This option is correct. If treating the ticking bomb case as a single instance justifies the practice of torture, then it implies that the practice of torture is justified in general.\n\nD. Neither A nor B\n- This option is incorrect. The argument does imply that treating the ticking bomb case as a single instance justifies the practice of torture, which is a significant concern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both A and B"
