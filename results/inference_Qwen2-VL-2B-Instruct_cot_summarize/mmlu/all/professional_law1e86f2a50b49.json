In this case, the plaintiff's case-in-chief involved calling the managing agent of the defendant corporation as a witness. The defense counsel objected to the plaintiff's questions either as leading or as impeaching the witness. The trial court should overrule these objections because the witness is adverse to the plaintiff and therefore may be interrogated by leading questions and subjected to impeachment. This is a standard practice in legal proceedings to ensure that the witness is not subjected to unfair questioning and to maintain the integrity of the trial."
