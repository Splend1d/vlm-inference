In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\"\nJohn L.

                    "text": "The principle described in the passage is about the divine principles and the establishment of a nation that is destined to manifest the excellence of these principles on earth. This principle is about the idea that the nation of many nations is destined to manifest the excellence of divine principles and to establish a nation that is governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, brotherhood, and peace and good will amongst men.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Colonists were destined to leave the British Empire because of the distance between the New World and England.\n- This option talks about the geographical location of the colonies and does not directly relate to the divine principles or the establishment of a nation governed by divine principles.\n\nB. Women are biologically predestined to lives of child rearing and domestic labor.\n- This option talks about the biological nature of women and does not relate to the divine principles or the establishment of a nation governed by divine principles.\n\nC. America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\n- This option talks about the inevitability of America's expansion and the divine sanction, which aligns with the principle described in the passage about the divine principles and the establishment of a nation governed by divine principles.\n\nD. The abolition of slavery in the United States was certain to come about because slavery was immoral.\n- This option talks about the moral aspect of slavery and does not relate to the divine principles or the establishment of a nation governed by divine principles.\n\nTherefore, the best statement that best states the principle described above is:\n\nC. America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned."
