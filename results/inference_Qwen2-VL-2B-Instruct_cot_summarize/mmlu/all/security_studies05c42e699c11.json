Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field.\n- This statement is relevant because it highlights the interdisciplinary nature of peace studies, which involves combining social sciences with natural sciences.\n\nB. Now of fundamental importance to peace studies as a field of research, the creation of journals was not a prominent feature of the peace studies until late in the twentieth century.\n- This statement is relevant because it discusses the development of journals, which are essential for the dissemination of research in peace studies.\n\nC. Most early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia.\n- This statement is relevant because it describes the geographical focus of early peace studies, which was primarily in North America and Scandinavia.\n\nD. The establishment of research institutes across the world has been one of the lasting successes of peace studies.\n- This statement is relevant because it discusses the impact of research institutes, which are crucial for the development and advancement of peace studies.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies is:\n\nA. Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field.\n\nFinal answer: A. Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field."
