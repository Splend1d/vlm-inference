The American Atheism Association (AAA) has put together a broadcast segment about atheism, rejecting all religions, but four of the five Texarkana stations have declined to air the segment because they believe it would violate the statute. AAA has filed suit against the state, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. What is the strongest argument AAA can make in support of striking down the Equal Rights for All Religions statute?\n\nA. The First Amendment prohibits government interference with freedom of the press.\nB. The fact that the statute involves only broadcast media and not print media is an Equal Protection violation.\nC. The First Amendment prohibits government interference with the free exercise of religion.\nD. The statute is not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.\n"

The statute is not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that a law must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The statute in question, requiring equal time for segments discussing Christianity, would not be narrowly tailored because it does not address the promotion of any specific religion or belief system. Instead, it requires equal time for all religions, which is a broad and vague requirement that does not serve a compelling governmental interest. Therefore, the statute is not narrowly tailored and thus unconstitutional."
