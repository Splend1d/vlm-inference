Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

                    "text": "To determine the most supported inference from the passage, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. The passage mentions a copper mine in ZKRY, where ingots are brought to BYTY.\n2. The copper is sold for two-thirds of its weight in gold.\n3. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth.\n4. The gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Mali was able to forge advanced bronze tools from its mineral resources.\n- The passage does not provide any information about the technology or tools that were forged from the mineral resources of Mali. Therefore, this inference cannot be supported.\n\nB. International trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources.\n- The passage does not mention any international trade or exchange of mineral resources. Therefore, this inference cannot be supported.\n\nC. The jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit.\n- The passage does not provide any information about the collection of jizya or the criteria for its collection. Therefore, this inference cannot be supported.\n\nD. Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth.\n- The passage mentions that the gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth, indicating that Mali had advanced mining technologies. Therefore, this inference is supported.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most supported inference is:\n\nD. Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth."
