This is a sphere of radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) centered at the origin in \\(R^3\\). The expression \\(x + 4z\\) represents a line in \\(R^3\\). The minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) as a function of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) is achieved when \\(x = 0\\) and \\(z = 0\\), because this point lies on the sphere and is the closest point to the origin in the direction of the line \\(x + 4z\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 0\\) and \\(z = 0\\) into the expression \\(x + 4z\\), we get:\n\\[0 + 4(0) = 0\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) as a function defined on \\(R^3\\) subject to the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\) is \\(0\\), which corresponds to option A."
