The contractor who installed the shutters did so by drilling screws and brackets into the exterior window frames and the shutters. The man later agreed to sell the home to a buyer. The sales agreement did not mention the shutters, the buyer did not inquire about them, and the buyer did not conduct a walkthrough inspection of the home before the closing. The man conveyed the home to the buyer by warranty deed. After the sale closed, the buyer noticed that the shutters and brackets had been removed from the home and that the window frames had been repaired and repainted. The buyer demanded that the man return the shutters and pay the cost of reinstallation, claiming that the shutters had been conveyed to him with the sale of the home. When the man refused, the buyer sued. Is the buyer likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the sales agreement did not mention the shutters.\nB. No, because the window frames had been repaired and repainted after removal of the shutters.\nC. Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.\nD. Yes, because the man gave the buyer a warranty deed and the absence of the shutters violated a covenant of the deed.\n"

                    "text": "The buyer is likely to prevail in this situation. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Sales Agreement and Shutter Removal**: The sales agreement did not mention the shutters, and the buyer did not inquire about them. This lack of mention and the absence of inquiry suggest that the shutters were not part of the conveyance of the home. The absence of inquiry and the absence of mention in the sales agreement indicate that the shutters were not conveyed to the buyer.\n\n2. **Window Frames Repainted**: The window frames were repaired and repainted after the shutters were removed. This repair and repainting of the window frames does not affect the conveyance of the shutters. The repair and repainting of the window frames is a separate matter and does not affect the conveyance of the shutters.\n\n3. **Warranty Deed**: The man conveyed the home to the buyer by a warranty deed. This deed is a legal document that transfers ownership of the property. The absence of the shutters in the conveyance deed does not affect the conveyance of the shutters. The conveyance deed is a legal document that is binding on the parties and does not depend on the presence or absence of specific items.\n\n4. **Covenant of Deed**: The man gave the buyer a warranty deed, which is a legal document that transfers ownership of the property. The absence of the shutters in the warranty deed does not affect the conveyance of the shutters. The warranty deed is a legal document that is binding on the parties and does not depend on the presence or absence of specific items.\n\nGiven these points, the absence of the shutters in the sales agreement, the repair and repainting of the window frames, and the warranty deed all support the conclusion that the shutters were not conveyed to the buyer. Therefore, the buyer is likely to prevail in the lawsuit. The correct answer is:\n\n**A. No, because the sales agreement did not mention the shutters.**"
