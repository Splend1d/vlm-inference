He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, \"If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. \" The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be\n\nA. a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.\nB. a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\nC. the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.\nD. a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n"

The context is a situation where an athlete has agreed to pay his friend $1,000 for driving him to and from the baseball team's training facilities and paying for their housing and meal expenses during their stay. The athlete then assigns to his friend 10 percent of his first-year earnings, which is $100,00.\n\nThe friend then files suit to enforce the assignment. The most applicable legal principle here is:\n\nB. A contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\n\nThis principle states that a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not enforceable. In this case, the assignment of the athlete's rights to pay for the friend's expenses was made in the context of the athlete's first-year earnings, not in the future. Therefore, the assignment is not valid and the friend can enforce it.\n\nThe other options do not directly apply to the situation described:\n\nA. A purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.\n   - This option is not relevant because the assignment was made in the context of the athlete's first-year earnings, not in the future.\n\nC. The friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.\n   - This option is not relevant because the friend did not rely on the assignment prior to the revocation.\n\nD. A gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n   - This option is not relevant because the assignment was made in the context of the athlete's first-year earnings, not in the future.\n\nTherefore, the most applicable legal principle is:\n\nB.
