Strom contributed land with an adjusted basis of $16,000 and a fair market value of $50,000.\n2. The land was subject to a mortgage of $24,000, which was assumed by Ace.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the adjusted basis of the land. The adjusted basis is calculated as the sum of the fair market value and the mortgage amount, minus the adjusted basis of the land itself. \n\nAdjusted basis of land = Fair market value + Mortgage amount - Adjusted basis of land\nAdjusted basis of land = $50,000 + $24,000 - $16,000\nAdjusted basis of land = $64,000\n\nNow, Strom's basis in Ace is the difference between the adjusted basis of the land and the value of the land contributed by Strom. \n\nBasis in Ace = Adjusted basis of land - Value contributed by Strom\nBasis in Ace = $64,000 - $16,000\nBasis in Ace = $48,000\n\nTherefore, Strom's basis in Ace is $48,000. The correct answer is:\n\nD. $32,000"
