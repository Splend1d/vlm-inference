The group \\(G\\) must have 16 elements, and since it is abelian, it must have 12 elements of order 2 (since the order of an element in an abelian group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element and \\(a\\) is an element of the group). Therefore, \\(G\\) must have 6 elements of order 2.\n\n2. The remaining 6 elements of \\(G\\) must be of order 3. This is because the order of an element in an abelian group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\), and since \\(G\\) is abelian, the order of any element must be a divisor of 6 (since 6 is the smallest number that divides 16).\n\nGiven that \\(G\\) has 6 elements of order 2 and 6 elements of order 3, we can construct \\(G\\) as follows:\n\n- The group \\(G\\) can be constructed as a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and three cyclic groups of order 3. This is because the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and three cyclic groups of order 3 will result in a group of order 12, which is 6 more than 16. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 will give us 6 elements of order 2, and the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 3 will give us 6 elements of order 3.\n\nTherefore, the group \\(G\\) can be constructed as:\n\\[G = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\]\n\nThis construction ensures that \\(G\\) has 16 elements, and each element of \\(G\\) satisfies the condition \\(x + x + x + x = 0\\) for each \\(x\\) in \\(G\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2"
