The key point here is whether the man was aware of the ordinance before he washed his car.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The man was not aware of the ordinance.\n- This would be the most relevant fact. If the man was unaware of the ordinance, it would be difficult for the city to prove negligence. The man would argue that he did not know the ordinance existed and therefore did not violate it.\n\nB. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.\n- This fact would not help the man. The city council's decision to enact the ordinance does not affect the man's awareness of the ordinance before he washed his car.\n\nC. The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.\n- This fact would not help the man. The proximity of the driver to the man does not affect the man's awareness of the ordinance before he washed his car.\n\nD. The driver is not a resident of the city.\n- This fact would not help the man. The man's awareness of the ordinance does not depend on whether he is a resident of the city.\n\nThe most relevant fact for the man to argue that he was unaware of the ordinance is that he was not aware of the ordinance before he washed his car. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The man was not aware of the ordinance."
