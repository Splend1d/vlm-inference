Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision\n\nThis is because the patient has swallowed a nail, which is a foreign body. The nail is likely to obstruct the esophagus and cause significant distress and potential complications. Open laparotomy is the most appropriate surgical procedure to remove the nail safely and effectively."
