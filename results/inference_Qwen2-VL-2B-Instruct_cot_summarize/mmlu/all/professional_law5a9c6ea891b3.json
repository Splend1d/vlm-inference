The officers obtained a valid arrest warrant for the man and went to his house to arrest him. The officers found the front door ajar and could hear a radio playing inside. They knocked on the door, identified themselves as police officers, and stated that they had a warrant. Getting no response, the officers entered the house. After the officers called the man's name several times and again identified themselves as police officers, the man emerged from the basement and was arrested. The officers went into the basement to look for the accomplice. They opened a closet door and found cocaine in plain view. They did not find the accomplice. The man was indicted for cocaine possession. He has moved to suppress the cocaine as evidence on the ground that it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because the officers discovered the cocaine during a lawful protective sweep of the house looking for the man's accomplice.\nB. No, because the search was incident to the man's arrest.\nC. Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.\nD. Yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet.\n"

                    "text": "The court should grant the motion to suppress the cocaine evidence. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Probable Cause**: The officers had probable cause to believe that the man had committed a series of armed bank robberies with an accomplice. This is a standard for arrest, not for a search warrant. The officers had a valid arrest warrant for the man, which was sufficient to justify the search.\n\n2. **Search Warrant**: The officers did not have a search warrant for the closet. The search was conducted without a warrant, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment's requirement of a warrant before a search.\n\n3. **Incident to Arrest**: The search was conducted incident to the man's arrest. The officers had probable cause to believe the man was involved in the robberies, and the search was conducted to arrest him. This is a lawful protective sweep.\n\n4. **Cocaine in Plain View**: The officers did not have a warrant to search the closet, but they did find cocaine in plain view. This is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, as the search was conducted incident to the arrest and the officers had probable cause to believe the man was involved in the robberies.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the cocaine evidence because the search was conducted incident to the man's arrest and the officers did not have a search warrant for the closet. The Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches conducted incident to an arrest, and the officers had probable cause to believe the man was involved in the robberies."
