After missing two practices, the football player was dropped from the team by the head football coach. Following his dismissal, the football player met with the coach and asked if he could rejoin the team. The coach said that the football player was despised by the other players and under no circumstances could he return to the team. As the football player was leaving the coach's office, feeling very dejected, the coach then said to him, \"Hope you decide to transfer, because everybody hates your guts around here. \"Later that same evening, the football player wrote a suicide note in which he stated, \"The coach is responsible for my despondency. If I can't play football, I don't want to live. \" After swallowing a bottle of Quaalude barbiturates, the football player fell unconscious in his dormitory room. Moments later, the football player's roommate entered the room and saw his limp body on the floor. The roommate read the suicide note and then attempted to administer aid. Failing to revive him, the roommate picked up the football player and carried him to the college's first aid center.

The key point here is whether the coach's remark was intended to cause emotional distress or whether it was a mere statement of fact.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **prevail, because the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.**\n   - This option suggests that the coach's intention to cause emotional distress was the basis for the football player's claim. However, the coach's remark was not intended to cause emotional distress but rather to express his opinion about the football player's behavior and reputation. This is not an intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nB. **prevail, because the coach's remark did, in fact, cause the football player to suffer emotional distress.**\n   - This option suggests that the coach's remark did cause emotional distress. However, the coach's remark was not intended to cause emotional distress but rather to express his opinion about the football player's behavior and reputation. This is not an intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nC. **not prevail, because the football player's drug overdose resulted from his own voluntary act.**\n   - This option suggests that the football player's drug overdose was a result of his own voluntary act, which would negate the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the coach's remark was not intended to cause emotional distress but rather to express his opinion about the football player's behavior and reputation. This is not an intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nD. **not prevail, because the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, since everyone on the team hated the football player.**\n   - This option suggests that the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, which would negate the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the coach's remark was not intended to cause emotional distress but rather to express his opinion about the football player's behavior and reputation. This is not an intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate interpretation is that the coach's remark was not intended to cause emotional distress but rather to express his opinion about the football player's behavior and reputation. Therefore, the football player's claim that the coach intended to cause him emotional distress will most likely not prevail.\n\nThe final answer is:\n**D. not prevail, because the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, since everyone on the team hated the football player.**"
