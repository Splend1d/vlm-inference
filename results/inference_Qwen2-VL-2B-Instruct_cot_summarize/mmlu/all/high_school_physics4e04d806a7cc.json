Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\nE = (8.99 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m^2/C^2) * (1/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080) * (4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 C - 4.0 \u00d7 10^-9 C) / (0.02 m)^2\nE = (8.99 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m^2/C^2) * (1/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080) * (0) / (0.0004 m)^2\nE = 0\n\nTherefore, the electric field strength at the point midway between the charges is 0, which corresponds to option A."
