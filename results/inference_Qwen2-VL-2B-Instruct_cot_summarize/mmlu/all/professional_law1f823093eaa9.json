The judge has the authority to strike a potential juror for cause if the juror has a relationship that could reasonably be expected to cause bias. In this case, the potential juror's relationship to the company could reasonably be expected to cause bias, as he was an employee of the company and still owns shares of its stock. Therefore, the judge should strike the potential juror for cause. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company."
