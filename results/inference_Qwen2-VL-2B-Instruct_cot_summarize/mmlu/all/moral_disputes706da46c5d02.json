He argues that the death penalty is not just a punishment but also a form of social control and a means of maintaining order. Van den Haag's argument suggests that the death penalty is not just a punishment but also a form of social control and a means of maintaining order.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. We should refrain from imposing the death penalty.\n- This option aligns with van den Haag's argument. He argues that the death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and therefore, it should not be imposed.\n\nB. The refusal to execute criminals has a civilizing effect.\n- This option is not directly supported by van den Haag's argument. While he does mention that the death penalty is a form of social control and order, he does not explicitly state that the refusal to execute criminals has a civilizing effect.\n\nC. We should institute death by torture.\n- This option is not supported by van den Haag's argument. He argues against the death penalty, not for the use of torture as a punishment.\n\nD. Murder is wrong.\n- This option is not directly supported by van den Haag's argument. He does not make a direct argument about the morality of murder.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that aligns most closely with van den Haag's argument is:\n\nA. We should refrain from imposing the death penalty.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is A."
