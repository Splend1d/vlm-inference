One afternoon while the judge was mowing his lawn, the father decided to avenge his son's conviction. The father set up his water sprinkler behind some shrubbery separating their adjoining properties. As the judge was mowing his lawn and came within reach of the water sprinkler, the father turned on the sprinkling device. The judge did not see the water coming toward him. The water hit the judge in the back and drenched him. The judge would be able to recover against the father for which of the following tort or torts?\n\nA. Negligence and battery.\nB. Battery and assault.\nC. Negligence and assault.\nD. Battery and trespass to land.\n"

This is a clear example of battery.\n\n2. **Assault**: The father's act of turning on the sprinkler was not only harmful but also intended to cause harm. This is a clear example of assault.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Battery and assault."
