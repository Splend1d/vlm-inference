As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse\u00d5s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded tothe complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against thenurse\u00d5s attorney. Is the court likely to grant the hospital\u00d5s motion?\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\nC. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.\nD. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Complaint**: The nurse's complaint is about age discrimination, specifically the hospital's decision to fire him because of his age. The hospital's response to the complaint is that the nurse's replacement was hired because of his age, rendering the nurse's complaint unavailable.\n\n2. **Nature of the Motion**: The hospital's motion for sanctions is a legal motion to impose sanctions against the attorney for filing an unfounded complaint. The motion is based on the hospital's argument that the nurse's complaint is not valid because the replacement was hired for the same reason.\n\n3. **Nature of the Attorney's Inquiry**: The attorney's inquiry was to determine whether the nurse's complaint was valid. The attorney conducted a reasonable pre-filing inquiry, which is a standard procedure in legal proceedings.\n\n4. **Nature of the Complaint**: The nurse's complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing law based on the facts in this case. The hospital's response to the complaint is that the nurse's complaint is not valid because the replacement was hired for the same reason.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions because the nurse's complaint is not valid and the attorney's inquiry was reasonable. The court is not likely to grant sanctions against the attorney of a represented party, nor is it likely to grant sanctions because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing law based on the facts in this case.**"
