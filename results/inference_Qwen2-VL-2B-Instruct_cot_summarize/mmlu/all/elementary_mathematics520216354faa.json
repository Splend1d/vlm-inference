It is located at -25 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\n- This is incorrect because point B is to the left of point A.\n\nB. It is located at -15 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\n- This is incorrect because point B is to the left of point A.\n\nC. It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n- This is incorrect because point B is to the right of point A.\n\nD. It is located at -15 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n- This is correct because point B is located at -15 and is to the left of point A.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement about point B is:\n\nD.
