Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after the defeats in a recent election, the Party expelled all nonLatino members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Latinos. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in their Congressional District. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poil. In an action by non-Latino citizens in the relevantCongressional District to enjoin the Latino AmericanParty from conducting the mail ballot primary, thefederal court will most likely\n\nA. grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.\nB. grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\nC. deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.\nD. deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.\n"

The party's members pledged to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. The party expelled non-Latino members after recent defeats, suggesting a belief in the party's ability to effectively represent Latino interests.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.\"\n     - The Thirteenth Amendment prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude, but it does not specifically address political parties or elections. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n   - **Option B**: \"grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\"\n     - The Fifteenth Amendment guarantees the right to vote to all citizens, including those of color. However, it does not specifically address the issue of political parties or elections. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n   - **Option C**: \"deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.\"\n     - The Constitution does not explicitly prohibit private actions by political parties. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n   - **Option D**: \"deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.\"\n     - The Constitution grants the federal government the power to regulate elections, including the conduct of primary elections. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The primary election is a private action by the Latino American Party, and it is not subject to restriction under the Constitution. Therefore, the court is most likely to deny relief to non-Latino citizens who are enjoining the party from conducting the mail ballot primary.\n\n**Final Answer**: D. deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control."
