Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is engaging in a behavior that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Letting a dog hump all the dogs in the dog park is considered inappropriate and potentially harmful to the dogs involved. In Scenario 2, the main character is simply performing a task that is considered normal and expected behavior, such as putting dishes in the dishwasher and starting it. This action does not violate any moral standards and is generally considered acceptable."
