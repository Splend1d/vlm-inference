This scenario does not involve any actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The character's actions are not inherently wrong, as they are not harmful to others or violate any moral principles.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character pushed their sister off of the swing at the park. This scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action. Pushing someone off an object is generally considered to be a violent and harmful act, which is considered morally wrong."
