The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it's a three-digit number, it cannot be 0).\n2. The second digit can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n3. The third digit can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nSince each digit can independently take on any of its possible values, we multiply the number of possibilities for each digit together.\n\nFor the first digit, there are 9 possibilities (1 through 9).\nFor the second digit, there are 10 possibilities (0 through 9).\nFor the third digit, there are also 10 possibilities (0 through 9).\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit positive integers is the product of the number of possibilities for each digit:\n\n\\[9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 900."
