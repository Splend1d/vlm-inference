The character's action of insisting on being the last in line to receive food implies a lack of concern for others' needs and a disregard for fairness. This is a clear violation of the principle of fairness and the moral obligation to treat others as equals.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) does not do anything clearly morally wrong. The character spent the grocery money on needed food items, which is a morally acceptable action. This action aligns with the principle of self-interest and the moral obligation to prioritize one's own needs and well-being."
