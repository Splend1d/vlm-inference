                    "text": "To determine the most probable cause of the marital strain evident in the passage, let's analyze the context and the letter's content step by step.\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage is from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, dated ca. 1200. The trader is expressing his wish to divorce his wife, stating that the waiting period for relief from the Creator has been long, and he cannot come home with nothing. He is offering his wife the option to end the marriage and is free to do so.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **A. The strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation**: This option suggests that the long periods of separation might be causing strain in the family. However, the passage does not explicitly mention any family issues or stress.\n   - **B. Religious disagreements arising from the merchant's exposure to Hinduism**: This option suggests that the religious differences might be causing strain. The passage does not mention any religious differences or conflicts.\n   - **C. A decision on the part of the merchant to remain permanently in India**: This option suggests that the merchant's decision to stay in India might be causing strain. The passage does not explicitly mention any decision to stay in India.\n   - **D. Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home**: This option suggests that the financial strain might be causing strain. The passage does not explicitly mention any financial issues or bankruptcy.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: After analyzing each option, it is clear that the passage does not explicitly mention any financial strain or financial issues. The focus is on the long waiting period for relief from the Creator and the decision to end the marriage.\n\nTherefore, the most probable cause of the marital strain evident in the passage is:\n\n**D. Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home**"
