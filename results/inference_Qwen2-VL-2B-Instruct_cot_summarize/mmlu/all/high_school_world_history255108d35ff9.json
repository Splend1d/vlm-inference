Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\nFrench revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794\nThe passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles?\n\nA.

The end justifies the means\n\nThe passage discusses the French Revolution, highlighting the importance of maintaining the rights of the public interest over private interests and the need to smother internal and external enemies of the Republic. It emphasizes the necessity of leading the people by reason and using terror (justice) as a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to the most urgent needs of the country. This aligns with the principle of \"the end justifies the means,\" which suggests that the means used to achieve a goal should be justified by the goal itself."
