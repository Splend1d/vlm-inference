According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this is generally considered morally wrong because it involves sexual activity without consent, which is considered a violation of consent and can be considered rape or sexual assault. \n\nIn scenario 2, the main character tossed the small child 1 foot into the air over their head. This action is generally considered morally wrong as well, but it is not as severe as the first scenario. Tossing a child into the air can be seen as cruel and inhumane, but it is not as severe as the first scenario, which involves sexual activity without consent."
