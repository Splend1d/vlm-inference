She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?\n\nA. No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.\nB. No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\nC. Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.\nD. Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.\n"

                    "text": "The issue at hand revolves around the determination of lost earning capacity in a negligence case. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Nature of the Loss**: The woman lost her eye, which is a significant loss. However, she was also hospitalized, lost her coordination, and had several operations. These additional injuries and disabilities are not directly related to her ability to work as a ballet dancer.\n\n2. **Nature of the Evidence**: The trial court allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer, which is a speculative matter. The defendant claimed this was too speculative and should not be allowed.\n\n3. **Nature of the Dispute**: The main dispute is whether the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer is a relevant factor in determining the amount of damages awarded.\n\nGiven these points, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.\n\nThe appellate court is likely to consider whether the evidence of lost earning capacity is relevant and whether it is speculative enough to be excluded. The court will likely evaluate whether the evidence is necessary to determine the woman's overall financial loss and whether it is reasonable to infer that she would have been a successful ballet dancer based on her training and potential for success."
