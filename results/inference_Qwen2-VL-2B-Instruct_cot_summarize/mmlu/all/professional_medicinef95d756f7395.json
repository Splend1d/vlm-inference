All patients enrolled in the study are informed that they would be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. They are assigned to successive dose cohorts of 300 to 1000 mg/day of the drug. Six to eight patients are assigned to each dose. Treatment efficacy is determined based on the results of complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments conducted regularly throughout the study. This study is best described as which of the following?\n\nA. Case-control study\nB. Crossover study\nC. Open-labeled clinical trial\nD. Randomized clinical trial\n"

Open-labeled clinical trial\n\nAn open-labeled clinical trial is a type of clinical trial where patients are assigned to receive the treatment being studied without being randomized to specific dose groups. In this study, patients are assigned to successive dose cohorts of 300 to 1000 mg/day of the drug, and treatment efficacy is determined based on the results of complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments conducted regularly throughout the study. This type of study is often used when the goal is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new treatment without the need for randomization."
