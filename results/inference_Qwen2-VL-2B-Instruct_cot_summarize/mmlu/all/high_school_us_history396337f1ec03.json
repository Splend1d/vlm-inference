                    "text": "To determine which development in the broader society in the late 1800s is highlighted by the song \"The Hayseed,\" we need to analyze the lyrics and the context of the song.\n\nThe song \"The Hayseed\" is a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, written in 1872. It is a critique of the political and economic system of the time, particularly the role of big business and the influence of monopolies over the government.\n\nLet's break down the lyrics:\n\n1. \"I was once a tool of oppression\"\n   - This line suggests that the speaker was once a victim of oppression, which is a common theme in the song.\n\n2. \"And as green as a sucker could be\"\n   - This line implies that the speaker was naive and easily manipulated, which is another common theme.\n\n3. \"And monopolies banded together\"\n   - This line suggests that big business, represented by monopolies, worked together to oppress the speaker.\n\n4. \"To beat a poor hayseed like me\"\n   - This line implies that the speaker was a powerless individual who was easily defeated by powerful entities.\n\n5. \"The railroads and old party bosses\"\n   - This line suggests that the speaker was a victim of the railroads and old party bosses, who were powerful entities.\n\n6. \"Together did sweetly agree\"\n   - This line implies that the speaker and others agreed on a plan to oppress the speaker.\n\n7. \"And they thought there would be little trouble\"\n   - This line suggests that the speaker and others thought that there would be little resistance to their plan.\n\n8. \"In working a hayseed like me\"\n   - This line implies that the speaker was a powerless individual who was easily manipulated.\n\nFrom these lines, it is clear that the song is a critique of the political and economic system of the time, particularly the role of big business and the influence of monopolies over the government. The speaker is portrayed as a powerless individual who is easily defeated by powerful entities.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.\n   - This option aligns with the theme of the song, as it suggests that the speaker and others were frustrated with the corruption in government and the influence of big business.\n\nB. A large-scale movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers, was able to exert a great deal of leverage over federal legislation.\n   - This option is not directly related to the song's theme. The song focuses on the oppression of a powerless individual by powerful entities, not on the struggles of farmers or factory workers.\n\nC. The two-party system of the era broke down and led to the emergence of an additional major party that was able to win control of Congress within ten years of its founding.\n   - This option is not directly related to the song's theme. The song is about the oppression of a powerless individual, not about the development of a new political party.\n\nD. Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians created a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers.\n   - This option is not directly related to the song's theme. The song is about the oppression of a powerless individual, not about the conflicts on the frontier.\n\nBased on the analysis, the development in the broader society that is highlighted by the song \"The Hayseed\" is:\n\nA. Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments."
