Induced dipole < hydrogen bond < dipole-dipole\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Induced dipole**: This is a type of dipole where the dipole is induced by another dipole. Induced dipoles are weaker than dipole-dipoles because they are not as stable and can easily break down.\n\n2. **Hydrogen bond**: Hydrogen bonds are a type of intermolecular force that involves the sharing of electrons between a hydrogen atom and a non-hydrogen atom. Hydrogen bonds are stronger than induced dipoles because they are more stable and can form stronger bonds.\n\n3. **Dipole-dipole**: This is a stronger type of intermolecular force than either induced dipole or hydrogen bond. Dipole-dipoles are formed when two molecules have opposite charges and are attracted to each other due to the electrostatic forces.\n\nSo, the order from strongest to weakest is:\n\n1. Induced dipole\n2. Hydrogen bond\n3. Dipole-dipole"
