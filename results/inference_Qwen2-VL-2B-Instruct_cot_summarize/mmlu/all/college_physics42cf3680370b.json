The period of an orbit is given by \\( T = \\frac{2\\pi a}{v} \\), where \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit and \\( v \\) is the orbital speed. Since the period is related to the moon's mass, it can be calculated from the measurements.\n\nB. **Mass of the planet**: The moon's minimum and maximum distances from the planet's center can be used to calculate the planet's mass. The planet's mass can be determined by the period of its orbit, which is related to its mass and the gravitational constant. Therefore, this measurement can be calculated from the observations.\n\nC. **Minimum speed of the moon**: The moon's minimum distance from the planet's center can be used to calculate the minimum speed of the moon. The minimum speed can be found using the formula \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\), where \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the planet, and \\( r \\) is the minimum distance from the planet's center. This calculation can be performed using the measurements.\n\nD. **Period of the orbit**: The moon's maximum distance from the planet's center can be used to calculate the period of the orbit. The period of an orbit is related to the moon's mass and the gravitational constant. Therefore, this measurement can be calculated from the observations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the measurement that cannot be calculated from the observations of the moon's orbit is:\n\n**C.
