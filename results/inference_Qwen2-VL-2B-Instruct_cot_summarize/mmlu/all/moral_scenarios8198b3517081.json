This action is considered morally wrong because it involves putting oneself in danger to help someone else, which is not a typical response to a fire. In Scenario 2, the main character had his old dog put down because he wanted to end his suffering. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a decision made by the owner of the dog, who is responsible for the dog's well-being and quality of life."
