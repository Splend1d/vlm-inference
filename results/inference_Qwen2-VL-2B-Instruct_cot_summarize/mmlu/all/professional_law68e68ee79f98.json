Shortly thereafter, while the purchaser was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, the purchaser quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, the purchaser turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck a pedestrian. Both the pedestrian and the purchaser suffered injuries. The pedestrian asserted a claim based on negligence against the bicycle company. At trial, it was found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, and that the bicycle company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have led to the discovery of the existence of the defect. Will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\nC. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser of the bicycle.\nD. No, because the purchaser was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.\n"

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Manufacturing Defect**: The bicycle company is found to have a manufacturing defect that led to the brake failure. This defect is a significant factor in the accident, as the failure of the brake resulted in the pedestrian being struck.\n\n2. **Negligence**: The pedestrian asserts that the bicycle company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have led to the discovery of the defect. This is a common defense in negligence cases, where the manufacturer is held liable for any defects in the product that were not discovered by the consumer.\n\n3. **Stream of Commerce**: The bicycle company is held to have placed the defective bicycle into the stream of commerce, meaning it was sold to a retailer who then sold it to the pedestrian. This is a legal principle that allows the manufacturer to be held responsible for defects in the product that were not discovered by the consumer.\n\nGiven these points, the pedestrian's claim is based on the manufacturer's failure to conduct a reasonable inspection, which is a significant factor in the accident. The manufacturer is held responsible for the defect in the bicycle, and the pedestrian's claim is based on the manufacturer's failure to discover and address the defect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company."
