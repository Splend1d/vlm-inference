In a system where political parties are often seen as \"winner-take-all,\" it can be challenging to create a party that can effectively represent the interests of working-class constituencies without alienating other groups within the electorate. This can lead to a fragmented political landscape where different groups may have to support multiple parties to gain representation, which can make it difficult to achieve a unified policy agenda that addresses the needs of all working-class individuals."
