Inter-rater reliability\n\nInter-rater reliability is the most critical kind of reliability in this study, as it measures the consistency of the raters' judgments on the same data. In this case, the raters are viewing the same footage and rating the children's behavior, which means they are assessing the same data points. Therefore, inter-rater reliability is essential to ensure that the study's findings are reliable and valid."
