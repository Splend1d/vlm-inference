However, the state now wishes to prosecute him for manslaughter, which is a lesser charge that involves a death resulting from a criminal act. Since Howard was acquitted of the crime of attempted murder, he cannot be found guilty of manslaughter of the other man. Therefore, he should not be found guilty of manslaughter of either his wife or the other man."
