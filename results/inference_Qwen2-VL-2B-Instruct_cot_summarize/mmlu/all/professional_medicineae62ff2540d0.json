Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n\nPCOS is a common cause of amenorrhea in young women, characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, obesity, and elevated levels of androgens. The patient's symptoms, including emaciation, are consistent with PCOS. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are less likely causes of amenorrhea in this age group, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (primary amenorrhea) is not typically seen in young women. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is also a common cause of amenorrhea in young women, but it is not as common as PCOS."
