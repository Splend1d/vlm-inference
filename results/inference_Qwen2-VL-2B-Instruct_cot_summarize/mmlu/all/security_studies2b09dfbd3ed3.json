'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W.\nB. 'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M.\nC. 'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.\nD. None of the above\n"

Booth, K.\n\nSecurity in the contemporary world, according to the field of Security Studies, is best described by Booth, K. This view emphasizes the importance of freedom from physical and human constraints, which leads to true security. It suggests that emancipation, rather than power or order, is the key to achieving true security."
