This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves deception and manipulation, which are not considered acceptable in most moral frameworks. In scenario 2, the main character is giving the sick child two hundred Advil for their fever. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves the use of medication without proper medical advice or consent, which can have serious consequences for the child's health."
