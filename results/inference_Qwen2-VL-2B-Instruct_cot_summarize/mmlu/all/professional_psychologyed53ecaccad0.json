PKU is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. A high intake of phenylalanine, which is found in certain foods, can lead to severe neurological damage and retardation. A special diet, which is low in phenylalanine, can help to prevent the development of PKU."
