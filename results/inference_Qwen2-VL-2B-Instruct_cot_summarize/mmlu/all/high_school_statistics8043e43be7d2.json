This is because the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. The formula for the standard deviation of a set of values is:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(\u03a3(x_i - \u03bc)^2 / N)\n\nwhere:\n\n\u03c3 is the standard deviation\nx_i is each individual value in the set\n\u03bc is the mean of the set\nN is the number of values in the set\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(\u03a3(x_i - \u03bc)^2 / N)\n\u03c3 = \u221a(\u03a3(25 - 1)^2 / 10000)\n\u03c3 = \u221a(\u03a3(24)^2 / 10000)\n\u03c3 = \u221a(24^2 / 10000)\n\u03c3 = \u221a(576 / 10000)\n\u03c3 = \u221a(0.0576)\n\u03c3 = 0.0768\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes is approximately 0.0768 pounds. The closest answer to this value is:\n\nD. 2.021 pounds"
