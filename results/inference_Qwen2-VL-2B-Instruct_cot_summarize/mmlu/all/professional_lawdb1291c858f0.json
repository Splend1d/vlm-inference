As part of their agreement, a courier was hired to pick up the card from the dealer and transport it to the collector. The courier was then to get the purchase money from the collector and bring it back to the dealer. But rather than entrusting the genuine card to the courier, the dealer gave him a counterfeit replica that was valueless. After picking up the envelope containing the replica, the courier left the dealer's home and embarked on his trip. The police, however, received a tip concerning the scheme and intercepted the courier's car before he left the city limits. Thereafter, the dealer was arrested and charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses. If the dealer contends that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt, it will\n\nA. be to his advantage to claim that the courier was his accomplice and was participating in the scheme to receive a share of the proceeds.\nB. be to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the dealer to make the delivery.\nC. be to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the collector to make the delivery.\nD. make no difference whether the courier was the dealer's accomplice or was an innocent agent.\n"

                    "text": "The problem involves understanding the legal implications of a scheme involving a counterfeit card and the actions of the courier. Here's a step-by-step analysis of each option:\n\n1. **Option A**: The dealer claims that the courier was his accomplice and was participating in the scheme to receive a share of the proceeds. This option suggests that the courier was involved in the scheme, which would make it difficult for the dealer to argue that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt. If the courier was involved, the dealer would have to prove that the courier was acting independently and not as part of the scheme.\n\n2. **Option B**: The dealer claims that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the dealer to make the delivery. This option suggests that the courier was an innocent agent who was hired by the dealer to perform the delivery. If the courier was an innocent agent, it would be difficult for the dealer to argue that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt. The dealer would have to prove that the courier was involved in the scheme.\n\n3. **Option C**: The dealer claims that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the collector to make the delivery. This option suggests that the courier was an innocent agent who was hired by the collector to perform the delivery. If the courier was an innocent agent, it would be difficult for the dealer to argue that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt. The dealer would have to prove that the courier was involved in the scheme.\n\n4. **Option D**: The dealer claims that the courier was an innocent agent who was hired by the dealer to perform the delivery. This option suggests that the courier was an innocent agent who was hired by the dealer to perform the delivery. If the courier was an innocent agent, it would be difficult for the dealer to argue that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt. The dealer would have to prove that the courier was involved in the scheme.\n\nGiven the context of the problem, the dealer's claim that the courier was an innocent agent who was hired by the collector to perform the delivery would be the most advantageous option. This would make it difficult for the dealer to argue that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt, as the courier would be seen as an innocent agent who was hired by the collector.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. be to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the collector to make the delivery.**"
