Since the original premises state that (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D), it implies that either A or B is true, or both are true.

Since the original premises state that (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D), it implies that either A or B is true, or both are true. This does not directly follow from the given premises.\n\nC. C \u2228 D\n- This is a disjunction of two propositions. Since the original premises state that (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D), it implies that either A or B is true, or both are true.
