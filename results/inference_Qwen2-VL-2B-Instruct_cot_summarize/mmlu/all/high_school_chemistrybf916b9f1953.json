Transition metals will lose their outermost s-block electrons when forming bonds.\n\nTransition metals are characterized by their ability to form bonds with other elements, and they tend to lose their outermost electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. This process is known as oxidation. The oxidation state of transition metals is typically +2, as they gain two electrons to achieve this stable configuration."
