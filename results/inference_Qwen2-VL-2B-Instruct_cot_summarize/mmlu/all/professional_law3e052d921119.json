At trial, evidence of this conviction is\n\nA. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\nB. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\nC. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\nD. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\n"
