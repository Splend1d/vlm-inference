Two days after his funeral, the boy's mother saw a television program about gang violence and was shocked to see video of herself weeping over the boy's body. The video had been shot by the television reporting team while the boy's body was still lying on a public street. The mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of seeing the video. If the mother sues the television station for invasion of her privacy and that of her son, will the mother be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a person has no right to privacy after his or her death.\nB. No, because the street was open to the public and the subject was newsworthy.\nC. Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.\nD. Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video.\n"

The mother's emotional distress is a significant factor in determining whether she has a right to privacy. However, the mother's right to privacy is not absolute, and the court will consider whether the public interest in the dissemination of news outweighs the mother's privacy concerns.\n\nGiven that the video was shot by the television reporting team while the boy's body was still lying on a public street, the mother's claim that she did not give permission to have the video used in the program is not a valid defense. The mother's emotional distress is a valid reason for her to sue, but the court will also consider whether the public interest in the dissemination of news outweighs her privacy concerns.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video."
