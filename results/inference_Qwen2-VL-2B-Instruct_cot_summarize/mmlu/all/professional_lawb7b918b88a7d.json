Another customer, who had not been threatened by the woman, forcefully grabbed the woman and locked her in the tavern's storeroom until the police could arrive. In the process, although the customer used reasonable force, the customer badly sprained the woman's wrist. Is the woman likely to recover in an action against the customer?\n\nA. No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\nB. Yes, based on battery only.\nC. Yes, based on false imprisonment only.\nD. Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n"

The customer's actions were reasonable and justified in the context of defending another person from an imminent threat of harm. Therefore, the customer's actions can be considered a defense of others, which is a legal defense that protects the customer from liability for the actions taken in self-defense.\n\nGiven this context, the customer's actions can be considered a defense of others, and therefore, the woman is likely to recover from her injuries. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others."
