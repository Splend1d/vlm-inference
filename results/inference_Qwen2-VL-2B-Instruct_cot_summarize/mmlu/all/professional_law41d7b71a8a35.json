In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 \u0080\u009421, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement provides the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener, we need to analyze the circumstances surrounding the gardener's employment and the subsequent events.\n\n1. **Gardener's Adjudication**: The gardener was adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, which means he was unable to pay the agreed-upon amount of $2,400. This is a significant financial issue that could affect the gardener's ability to complete the job.\n\n2. **Completion of Work**: The gardener had completed 80 heads out of the 240 that needed to be replaced. This means he had completed 33.33% of the job.\n\n3. **Employment and Unemployment**: The gardener was unable to find gainful employment during the period and his application for unemployment compensation was rejected. This indicates that he was unable to support himself financially.\n\n4. **Defective Sprinkler Heads**: The gardener was unable to replace the defective sprinkler heads, which suggests that the job was not completed to the owner's satisfaction.\n\nGiven these points, the most compelling reason for the owner to discharge the gardener is the gardener's inability to complete the job and the financial implications of his bankruptcy.\n\n**Final Answer: A. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12.**"
