Testimony concerning subsequent repairs to the truck paid for by the trucking company where they have stipulated to ownership.\n\nThis evidence is most likely to be admitted because it provides direct evidence of the trucking company's ownership and responsibility for the accident. The court is more likely to accept evidence of ownership or control over the vehicle if it is provided by the party that has the legal right to control the vehicle, in this case, the trucking company."
