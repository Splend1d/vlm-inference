Change from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would increase the power of the test.\nB. Change from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would increase the power of the test.\nC.

Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test.\n\nIn a two-sample t-test, the power of the test is influenced by the variability of the data. When variability is reduced, the test can detect smaller differences between groups, leading to a higher power to detect a true effect. This is because a smaller difference between groups is more likely to be detected at a given level of significance, assuming the null hypothesis is true."
