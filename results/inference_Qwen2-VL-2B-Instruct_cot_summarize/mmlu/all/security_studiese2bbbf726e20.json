Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.\nB. Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.\nC. There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.\nD. The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.\n"
