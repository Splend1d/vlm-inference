They see it as an ideological fa\u00e7ade for US imperialism\n\nContemporary European liberal democrats tend to object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy because they see it as an ideological fa\u00e7ade for US imperialism. They believe that the United States is using exceptionalism as a way to justify its global influence and to justify its interventions in other countries. This view is often associated with the idea that the United States is using its exceptional status to dominate the world and to spread its values and ideology."
