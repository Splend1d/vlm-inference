Dashing to the car, the husband then drove his wife and ailing son to the nearest hospital. On the way to the hospital, the son had a seizure and stopped breathing. Seconds later, the car went out of control despite the husband's reasonable efforts, swinging across the center line into oncoming traffic, where it collided wit.

In this jurisdiction, a statute makes it a misdemeanor for any motor vehicle to travel to the left of the center line of any two-way highway, road, or street. If the driver asserts a claim against the husband, the most likely result is that the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the husband is strictly liable for violating the statute.\nB. prevail, because the statute was designed to protect motorists such as the driver.\nC. not prevail, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.\nD. not prevail, because the husband was acting reasonably in an emergency.\n"

The statute in question is designed to protect motorists such as the driver, and the husband's actions were reasonable in an emergency. The statute does not apply to the husband, who was not a motorist, and the statute does not provide a defense for the husband. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. not prevail, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident."
