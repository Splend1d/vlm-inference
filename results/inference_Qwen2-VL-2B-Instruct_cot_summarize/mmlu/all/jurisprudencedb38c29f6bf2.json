Universal values are meaningless.\n\nLyotard's dictum \"I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives\" means that postmodernism is characterized by a skepticism or disbelief in the ability of any single narrative or meta-narrative to capture or explain the complexities and contradictions of the world. This skepticism extends to the idea that universal values or principles are meaningless, as they are not able to account for the diversity and multiplicity of human experiences and perspectives."
