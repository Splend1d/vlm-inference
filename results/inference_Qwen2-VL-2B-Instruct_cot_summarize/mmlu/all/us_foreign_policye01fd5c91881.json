Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n\nCountries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market because the costs of free trade are concentrated, but the benefits are dispersed. This means that while free trade can lead to increased competition and potentially lower prices for consumers, it can also lead to increased competition for domestic firms, which can lead to job losses and reduced economic growth. Additionally, free trade can lead to increased trade barriers and tariffs, which can further harm domestic firms."
