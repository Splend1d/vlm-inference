When a price ceiling is imposed, it creates a shortage of the good or service, as producers are incentivized to produce more to take advantage of the higher price. This leads to a decrease in the quantity supplied, which in turn leads to a shortage of the good or service. As a result, the price ceiling is likely to be ineffective in achieving its intended goal of stabilizing the market price of the good or service."
