This is because the polynomial is of degree 3 and the only roots of an irreducible polynomial of degree 3 over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) are the roots of unity in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), which are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm i\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit. Since \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) is a field, it contains all its roots of unity, and thus the polynomial \\(x^3 + x^2 + c\\) cannot have any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\nTherefore, the only value of \\(c\\) that makes \\(Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c)\\) a field is \\(c = 0\\), because any other value of \\(c\\) would make the polynomial reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), and thus the quotient ring would not be a field.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0"
