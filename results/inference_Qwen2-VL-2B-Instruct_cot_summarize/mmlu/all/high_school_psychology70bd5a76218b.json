In this case, John has been handling money for 17 years, which means he has had ample opportunity to encode the pictures of the coins and bills into his memory. However, he is unable to recall them, indicating that the encoding process is not working properly.\n\nConfabulation is when a person creates false memories, which is not the case here. Failure to reconstruct is when a person has difficulty retrieving information from memory, which is also not the case. Deep processing refers to the process of processing information in the brain, which is not relevant to the issue of encoding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. failure to encode."
