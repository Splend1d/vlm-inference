According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, stealing is generally considered morally wrong. The main character's action is clearly morally wrong because it involves theft, which is a violation of property rights and is considered a theft offense.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character bought Joe's painting and then Joe stole it back. This scenario does not involve any theft or violation of property rights. The main character's action is not morally wrong because it does not involve any theft or violation of property rights."
