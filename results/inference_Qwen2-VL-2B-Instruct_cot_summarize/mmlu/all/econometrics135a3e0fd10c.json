In the context of GARCH models, MLE is used to estimate the parameters of the model. The likelihood function is maximized to find the parameter values that best fit the observed data. The likelihood function is a function of the parameters and the observed data, and it is maximized with respect to the parameters to find the values that maximize the likelihood.\n\nGARCH models are a type of GARCH model that are used to model the volatility of financial time series. GARCH models are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. The likelihood function is maximized to find the parameter values that best fit the observed data.\n\nThe other statements are not true. GARCH models can be estimated using both maximum likelihood estimation and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. The OLS and ML estimates for the slope and intercept parameters will be identical for a standard linear model (with no GARCH), but the estimator for the variance of the disturbances is slightly different. Most computer packages use numerical procedures to estimate GARCH models rather than a set of analytical formulae."
