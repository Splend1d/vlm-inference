Physiology\n\nThe difference in tail structure between monkeys of South and Central America and those of Africa and Asia is most likely due to evolutionary changes in the tail's structure and function. This could be explained by changes in the physiology of the tail, such as the development of muscles or the adaptation of the tail for specific functions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Physiology."
