Consumers' incomes cannot go as far now that prices have risen.\n- This statement is correct. When prices rise, consumers' purchasing power decreases, making it harder for them to buy the same amount of goods and services as before.\n\nII. Foreigners by less.\n- This statement is not necessarily correct. The impact of a rise in prices on foreign spending is complex and depends on various factors, including the exchange rate, the cost of living in the foreign country, and the overall economic conditions in the foreign country.\n\nIII. Higher prices result in higher interest rates which lower spending.\n- This statement is also correct. Higher prices lead to higher interest rates, which in turn reduces consumer spending as people tend to save more to avoid interest payments.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and III are correct."
