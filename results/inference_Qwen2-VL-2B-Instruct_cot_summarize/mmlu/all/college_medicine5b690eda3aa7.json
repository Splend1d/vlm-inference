Lower than the pOH\n\nFor a very weak base, the pKb (pKb is the negative logarithm of the equilibrium constant for the base being a weak acid) is typically lower than the pOH (pOH is the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution). This is because the equilibrium constant for a weak base being a weak acid is lower than 1, meaning that the concentration of the weak base is higher than the concentration of the weak acid."
