Recognition requires that the constitution of the recognized State includes sufficient human rights guarantees.\n\nThe constitutive theory of recognition is a concept in international law that states that a state must have a constitution that includes certain fundamental rights and freedoms in order to be recognized by other states. This theory is based on the idea that a state's recognition is contingent upon its adherence to certain standards of human rights and freedoms."
