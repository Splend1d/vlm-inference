Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\nC. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\nD. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\n"

The question asks us to explain the significance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans during the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.**\n   - This option suggests that European traders provided foodstuffs, which could have contributed to population growth. However, it doesn't directly address the role of trading contacts in the context of African underdevelopment.\n\nB. **Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.**\n   - This option implies that trading with Europeans led to the development of new states and kingdoms. However, it doesn't explain the role of trading contacts in African underdevelopment.\n\nC. **Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.**\n   - This option suggests that the primary role of trading contacts was to provide slaves. However, it doesn't explain the broader impact of trading contacts on African underdevelopment.\n\nD. **Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.**\n   - This option suggests that trading contacts led to alliances with European powers to eliminate Muslim and Arab merchant princes. This directly addresses the role of trading contacts in African underdevelopment by highlighting the impact of European intervention in African politics.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the question, the best explanation of the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. is:\n\n**D. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the role of trading contacts in African underdevelopment by explaining how European intervention led to the displacement of Muslim and Arab merchant princes, which in turn contributed to African underdevelopment."
