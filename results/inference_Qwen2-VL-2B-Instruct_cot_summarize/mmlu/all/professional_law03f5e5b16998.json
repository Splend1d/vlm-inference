Under state law, such an abuse of the prescription-writing privilege requires revocation of a doctor's license. After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing. The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license. The doctor does not deny the conviction or the factual basis for it. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the state medical board?\n\nA. A doctor's license to practice is a privilege, not a right, and therefore is not property within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding.\nC. The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.\nD. The licensing board was required to summarily revoke the doctor's license because Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the licensing board to give full faith and credit to the doctor's criminal conviction.\n"

The doctor claims that the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license, which he argues constitutes a deprivation of property without due process of law.\n\nLet's analyze each option to determine which one is the strongest argument in support of the state medical board:\n\nA. A doctor's license to practice is a privilege, not a right, and therefore is not property within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n- This option suggests that the license is not a property right, which is not relevant to the issue of due process. The due process clause is concerned with the right to a fair hearing, not the nature of the license itself.\n\nB. Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding.\n- This option suggests that the state's interest in preventing drug abuse is greater than the doctor's interest in the specific procedure. However, it does not directly address the issue of due process and the lack of a hearing.\n\nC. The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.\n- This option argues that the facts necessary for the license revocation were determined in a criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require a further hearing. This is a valid point, but it does not directly address the issue of due process and the lack of a hearing.\n\nD. The licensing board was required to summarily revoke the doctor's license because Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the licensing board to give full faith and credit to the doctor's criminal conviction.\n- This option suggests that the revocation was based on the doctor's criminal conviction, which is a legal basis for the revocation. However, it does not directly address the issue of due process and the lack of a hearing.\n\nThe strongest argument in support of the state medical board is option B. It argues that the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the specific procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding. This aligns with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires a balancing of interests to ensure due process.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nB. Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding."
