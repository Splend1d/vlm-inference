HM has some aspects in common with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it offers something distinctive in having class conflict within capitalism as its central focus.\nC. Whilst HM recognises the importance of the state as an actor within the international system, it also purports that states prioritize the interests of the ruling-class elite.\nD. All of the above\n"

It posits that the state is a product of the class struggle and that the interests of the ruling class are prioritized over those of the working class. This theory is distinct from realism, which focuses on the economic and political structures of capitalism and the role of the state in maintaining these structures. \n\nLiberalism and social constructivism are also related to realism, but they focus on different aspects of the capitalist system. Liberalism emphasizes individual rights and the role of the state in protecting these rights, while social constructivism focuses on the role of culture and social norms in shaping economic and political structures. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
