It weakened the plantation system in the southern states.\n\nThis was because the new transportation networks allowed for the movement of goods and people across the country, which led to increased competition and economic growth in the northern states. This, in turn, weakened the plantation system in the southern states, as they could no longer rely on the export of cotton and other crops to the northern market."
