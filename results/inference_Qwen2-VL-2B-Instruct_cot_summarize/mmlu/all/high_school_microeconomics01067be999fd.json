Elsa tutors David for two hours.\n3. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring.\n4. They negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus:\n\n- **Consumer surplus**: This is the difference between the amount the consumer is willing to pay and the amount the consumer actually pays. In this case, the consumer is willing to pay $175 but only pays $125. Therefore, the consumer surplus is $175 - $125 = $50.\n- **Producer surplus**: This is the difference between the amount the producer is willing to receive and the amount the producer actually receives. In this case, the producer is willing to receive $125 but only receives $125. Therefore, the producer surplus is $125 - $125 = $0.\n\nNow, let's compare these values:\n\n- **Consumer surplus**: $50\n- **Producer surplus**: $0\n\nThe difference between consumer surplus and producer surplus is $50.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**A. Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75.**"
