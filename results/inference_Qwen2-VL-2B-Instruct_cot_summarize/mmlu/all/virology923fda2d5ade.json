                    "text": "To determine which parameter is most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores, we need to consider the properties of each estimator.\n\n1. **Mean**: The mean is the average of all the scores. It is the most sensitive to outliers. If there are any students who scored exceptionally high or low, the mean will be heavily influenced by these scores. Therefore, the mean is likely to be the most biased estimator.\n\n2. **Median**: The median is the middle score when the scores are arranged in order. It is less affected by outliers than the mean. If there are any students who scored exceptionally high or low, the median will be less affected. Therefore, the median is likely to be a less biased estimator.\n\n3. **Mode**: The mode is the score that appears most frequently. It is not affected by outliers. Therefore, the mode is likely to be a less biased estimator.\n\n4. **Standard deviation**: The standard deviation measures the spread of the scores around the mean. It is less affected by outliers than the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation is likely to be a less biased estimator.\n\n5. **Variance**: The variance is the square of the standard deviation. It is a measure of how spread out the scores are from the mean. Therefore, the variance is likely to be a less biased estimator.\n\nGiven these considerations, the median is the most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Median"
