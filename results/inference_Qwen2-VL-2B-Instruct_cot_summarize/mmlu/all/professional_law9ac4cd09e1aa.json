As a result, a car that was next to the truck was forced off the highway and crashed into a concrete barrier along the roadway. The driver of the car suffered a broken leg. An ambulance arrived and rushed her to the hospital. A doctor there examined the broken leg and ordered X-rays to be taken. The doctor carelessly misread the X-rays and set the broken bone improperly. As a result of the doctor's negligence, the driver's leg never healed completely, and the driver was left with a significant impairment of the use of her leg. If the driver of the car brings a negligence action against the driver of the truck, the most likely result is\n\nA. the truck driver will not be liable for any damages, because the doctor's negligence constituted a superseding cause that relieved the truck driver of liability.\nB. the truck driver will be liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiff when her car crashed, but not the additional or enhanced harm resulting from the doctor's careless mistake.\nC. the truck driver will be liable only if his negligence is regarded by the jury as being more severe than the doctor's negligence.\nD. the truck driver will be liable for all the harm suffered by the plaintiff, although the doctor may be liable to some extent, as well.\n"

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the options provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The truck driver negligently changed lanes without checking, causing a car to crash into a barrier. The car's driver suffered a broken leg, and the doctor's negligence led to the leg not healing completely and causing a significant impairment.\n\n2. **Superseding Causes**: A superseding cause is a cause that occurs before the original cause and is the reason why the original cause is no longer the cause of the harm. In this case, the doctor's negligence is a superseding cause because it occurred before the original accident and caused the doctor's mistake.\n\n3. **Liability Analysis**:\n   - **Option A**: The truck driver will not be liable for any damages because the doctor's negligence constitutes a superseding cause that relieved the truck driver of liability.\n     - This option is incorrect because the truck driver's negligence was the original cause of the accident and the doctor's negligence was a superseding cause, not a cause that relieved the truck driver of liability.\n\n   - **Option B**: The truck driver will be liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiff when her car crashed, but not the additional or enhanced harm resulting from the doctor's careless mistake.\n     - This option is incorrect because the truck driver's negligence was the original cause of the accident, and the doctor's negligence was a superseding cause, not a cause that increased the harm.\n\n   - **Option C**: The truck driver will be liable only if his negligence is regarded by the jury as being more severe than the doctor's negligence.\n     - This option is incorrect because the truck driver's negligence was the original cause of the accident, and the doctor's negligence was a superseding cause, not a cause that increased the harm.\n\n   - **Option D**: The truck driver will be liable for all the harm suffered by the plaintiff, although the doctor may be liable to some extent, as well.\n     - This option is correct because the truck driver's negligence was the original cause of the accident, and the doctor's negligence was a superseding cause, which relieved the truck driver of liability. However, the truck driver's negligence still constitutes the original cause of the harm, and the doctor's negligence is a superseding cause that relieved the truck driver of liability, so the truck driver will still be liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiff.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is:\n\n**D. the truck driver will be liable for all the harm suffered by the plaintiff, although the doctor may be liable to some extent, as well.**"
