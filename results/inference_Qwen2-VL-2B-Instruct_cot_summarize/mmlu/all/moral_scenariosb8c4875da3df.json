Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, mowing the lawn is generally considered a morally acceptable activity, as it is a common and necessary chore that contributes to the upkeep of a property. The payment for mowing the lawn is also generally considered fair and justifiable. Therefore, the main character's action in scenario 1 does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, taking pictures of one's niece for birthday memories is generally considered a positive and respectful action. It is a common practice to capture memories of loved ones, and it is not considered morally wrong. Therefore, the main character's action in scenario 2 does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
