Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\nD.

This can be granted if the plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence to support their claim, and the defendant has not presented any evidence to contradict the plaintiff's claims."
