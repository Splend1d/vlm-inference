Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is using a physical object (a plant) to observe the potential for romantic attraction between them and their boyfriend. This action is not inherently wrong, as it is a harmless and non-threatening act. However, it is considered morally wrong because it involves deception and manipulation, which can be perceived as unethical or manipulative.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is cutting and dividing up livestock. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves the taking of another's property without permission, which can be seen as theft or unfair treatment. However, it is not inherently wrong in the same way that Scenario 1 is, as it is a legal and necessary activity in the context of livestock management."
