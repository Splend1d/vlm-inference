However, the moral implications of these actions vary significantly. \n\nIn Scenario 1, the character watched from outside while the person took their shower. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves observing someone in private without their consent, which can be considered intrusive or disrespectful. \n\nIn Scenario 2, the character explained to the person that their house was on fire, despite the fact that the person couldn't stand their drama. This action is also generally considered morally wrong because it involves making a false accusation or spreading false information, which can harm the person's reputation or cause them distress. \n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions."
