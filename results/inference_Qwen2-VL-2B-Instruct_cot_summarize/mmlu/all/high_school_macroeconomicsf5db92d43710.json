GDP increases and the price level increases.\n\nWhen the President plans to cut taxes for consumers and also plans to increase spending on the military, this combination of policies is known as a fiscal stimulus. Fiscal stimulus increases government spending, which can boost aggregate demand and lead to an increase in GDP. At the same time, the reduction in taxes for consumers increases disposable income, which can also contribute to an increase in aggregate demand and GDP. Therefore, both the increase in government spending and the increase in disposable income from tax cuts lead to an increase in GDP. However, the increase in government spending and the increase in disposable income from tax cuts also lead to an increase in the price level, as the increase in aggregate demand leads to higher prices for goods and services."
