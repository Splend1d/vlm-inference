After the meeting, she was injured in the building's elevator as it suddenly fell and crashed to the basement from the third floor. She sued the building's owner, but at trial the only evidence she had regarding the issue of negligence was that she was in the elevator when it malfunctioned. Will the trial judge dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury?\n\nA. Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\nB. Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\nC. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n"

No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Negligence Burden**: The injured party must prove negligence by a preponderance of the evidence. This means they must show that the defendant was aware of the risk and failed to mitigate it.\n\n2. **Exclusive Control**: The elevator was under the owner's exclusive control, meaning the owner had the authority to manage and maintain the elevator. This implies that the owner had the responsibility to ensure the elevator was safe and functioning properly.\n\n3. **Ordinary Accident**: Accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence. This means that if the elevator malfunctioned and crashed, it would be considered an ordinary accident unless the owner had a duty to mitigate the risk and failed to do so.\n\n4. **Assumption of Risk**: The injured party assumed the risk when they decided to use the elevator. This does not absolve the owner of liability, as the owner still has the burden to prove negligence.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge cannot dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence."
