This is consistent with the idea that lifestyle factors, rather than early life experiences, are the primary determinants of health outcomes.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"the observed links between early experience and later health have only been seen in UK studies.\"\n   - This statement implies that the observed links between early life and health are specific to UK studies. However, the information provided does not mention any specific studies from the UK. The focus is on the general trend and the potential for adult lifestyle to explain observed health outcomes.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"the epidemiological evidence shows programmed differences in physiology are only linked to events before birth.\"\n   - This statement suggests that programmed differences in physiology are linked to events before birth. However, the information provided does not provide any evidence or support for this specific claim. The focus is on the general trend and the potential for adult lifestyle to explain observed health outcomes.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"the epidemiological evidence shows programmed differences in physiology are linked to events before birth and in early postnatal life.\"\n   - This statement aligns with the information provided. It suggests that the observed links between early life and health are linked to both events before birth and in early postnatal life. This is consistent with the idea that both early life experiences and adult lifestyle factors can contribute to health outcomes.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that is true is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. the epidemiological evidence shows programmed differences in physiology are linked to events before birth and in early postnatal life.**"
