                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Common Law Analysis:**\n   - The common law principle is that the predominate purpose of the contract is the sale of goods. This means that if the primary purpose of the contract was to sell the goods, the court will likely find for the buyer.\n   - In this case, the predominate purpose of the contract was to sell the laptop computer. Therefore, the trial court is likely to find for Connie.\n\n2. **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Analysis:**\n   - The UCC provides a different framework for determining the predominate purpose of a contract.\n   - Under the UCC, the predominate purpose of a contract is determined by the intent of the parties. If the parties intended to enter into a service agreement, the court will likely find for Computer Retailer.\n   - Since the laptop computer was sold, the predominate purpose of the contract was to sell the goods. Therefore, the trial court is likely to find for Computer Retailer.\n\n3. **Intent Analysis:**\n   - The UCC also allows for an intent analysis, which considers the parties' intent at the time of the contract.\n   - If the parties intended to enter into a service agreement, the court will likely find for Computer Retailer.\n   - Since the laptop computer was sold, the intent of the parties was to sell the goods. Therefore, the trial court is likely to find for Computer Retailer.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract."
