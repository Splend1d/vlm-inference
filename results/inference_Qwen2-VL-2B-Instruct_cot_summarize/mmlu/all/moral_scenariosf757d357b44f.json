This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves intentionally exposing someone to a harmful substance without their consent. In Scenario 2, the main character turned up the music when his neighbors complained about the noise in his apartment. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it was done in response to a legitimate complaint and was not done intentionally to harm the neighbors."
