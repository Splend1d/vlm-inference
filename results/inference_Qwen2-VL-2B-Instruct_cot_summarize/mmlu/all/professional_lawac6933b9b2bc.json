If the professor pleads truth as a defense, he should not be permitted to introduce evidence that shows that the graduate did, in fact, cheat on an examination in the entertainment law class. This is because the professor's statement is a defamatory falsehood, and it is not relevant to the graduate's actual conduct in the entertainment law class. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
