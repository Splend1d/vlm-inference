Employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded.\n\nBonding is a critical control in preventing unauthorized access to cash and other assets, which can be a significant risk factor for fraudulent financial reporting. If employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded, it increases the likelihood of unauthorized access to cash, which could lead to misappropriation of funds or other fraudulent activities. This control weakness can significantly impact the reliability of financial statements and the auditor's assessment of the entity's financial position and performance."
