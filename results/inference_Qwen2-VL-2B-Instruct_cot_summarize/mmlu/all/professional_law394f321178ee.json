The university's residency requirement is based on the student's age and residence status.\n2. The requirement is that the student must be over 21 and have established a legal residence in the state for at least one year preceding the last day of registration for credit.\n3. The student moved to the state and immediately enrolled, but did not meet the residency requirement.\n\nGiven this context, the court will likely examine whether the residency requirement is a valid and necessary condition for tuition fees. The court will likely consider whether the requirement is a valid and necessary condition for the university's purpose of charging tuition.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n   - This option suggests that the requirement violates the equal protection clause. However, the requirement is based on residency status, not on race, religion, or other protected groups. The requirement is not based on any discrimination against students based on their residency status.\n\nB. **Unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.**\n   - This option suggests that the requirement violates the privileges and immunities clause. However, the requirement is based on residency status, not on any privilege or immunity.\n\nC. **Constitutional, because the fee differential promotes a compelling state interest.**\n   - This option suggests that the requirement is constitutional because it promotes a compelling state interest. However, the requirement is based on residency status, not on any compelling state interest.\n\nD. **Constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.**\n   - This option suggests that the requirement is constitutional because it does not trigger strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny is typically applied when a law has a significant impact on a protected class, but the requirement here does not appear to have a significant impact on any protected class.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.**\n\nThe court will likely declare the provision constitutional because it does not trigger strict scrutiny, which is a higher standard of scrutiny."
