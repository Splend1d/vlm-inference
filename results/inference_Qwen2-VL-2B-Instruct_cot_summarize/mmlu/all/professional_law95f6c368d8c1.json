The key issue here is whether the arrest was lawful or unlawful, and whether the suspect's account of the events is credible.\n\n1. **Duty to Refrain from Using Force or Weapons:**\n   - The state statute provides that knowing or should know that one is being arrested is a duty to refrain from using force or weapons in resisting arrest. Violation of this duty is punishable by fine and/or imprisonment.\n\n2. **Account of Events:**\n   - The suspect claims that after being arrested, he cursed at the police officer, and the police officer began hitting him with his nightstick. The suspect then hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down.\n   - The police officer claims that after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist.\n\n3. **Jurisdiction and Evidence:**\n   - The state statute does not specify whether the arrest was lawful or unlawful. The key issue is whether the arrest was lawful based on the suspect's account.\n\n4. **Legal Implications:**\n   - If the arrest was lawful, the suspect's account of events is credible, and the police officer's account is not.\n   - If the arrest was unlawful, the suspect's account is not credible, and the police officer's account is credible.\n\nGiven the scenario, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.**"
