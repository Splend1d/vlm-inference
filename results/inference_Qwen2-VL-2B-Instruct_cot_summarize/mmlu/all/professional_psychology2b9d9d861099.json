This is because age can be a factor in job performance, and if the tests indicate that the individual is not likely to perform well, it may be necessary to consider age as a factor in the selection process. \n\nOption A is incorrect because age is not necessarily a factor in job performance. \n\nOption B is incorrect because age is not a bona fide occupational requirement. \n\nOption D is incorrect because standardized test results do not necessarily indicate that the incumbent does not have all the aptitudes expected for the particular job."
