Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline serve to amplify tidal flow at specific localities.\n\nTidal ranges are influenced by the shape of the coastline and the ocean floor topography. In areas with steep, rocky coastlines, the water has to travel a longer distance to reach the sea, which amplifies the tidal flow. Similarly, in areas with gentle slopes, the water can flow more easily, resulting in smaller tidal ranges. Additionally, the shape of the coastline can affect the direction of the tidal currents, further amplifying the tidal flow in certain areas."
