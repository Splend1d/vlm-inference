Selye's general adaptation syndrome\n\nSelye's general adaptation syndrome is a theory that explains how the body responds to stressors, such as exams or illness, by activating a series of physiological and psychological responses. This theory suggests that the body prepares for stress by increasing its energy levels, increasing heart rate, and other physiological changes. In Conrad's case, the stress of preparing for finals and then dealing with the flu would be an example of this response."
