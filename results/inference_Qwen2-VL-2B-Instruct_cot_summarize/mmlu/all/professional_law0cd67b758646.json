Near the end of the flight, the pilot saw a cloud of fog ahead but decided that he could navigate through it. He got lost in the fog and crashed the plane into the side of a mountain. The pilot and his passenger were both killed instantly in the crash. If the passenger's family brings a wrongful death action against the pilot's estate, the most likely result is that the plaintiffs will\n\nA. recover under strict liability, because the pilot engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\nB. recover under negligence, because the pilot failed to exercise reasonable care in the operation of his airplane.\nC. not recover, because the passenger did not pay to go on the flight.\nD. not recover, because the passenger unreasonably exposed himself to a known danger.\n"

In this case, the pilot's decision to fly through the fog and crash into the mountain would likely be considered an act of negligence, not strict liability.\n\n2. **Negligence**: Negligence is a legal doctrine that holds the defendant responsible for the harm caused to the plaintiff if the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in the operation of the airplane. The pilot's decision to fly through the fog and crash into the mountain would likely be considered negligence.\n\n3. **Wrongful Death Action**: The wrongful death action is a legal claim brought by the family of the deceased against the defendant. The family of the passenger would likely bring a wrongful death action against the pilot's estate, assuming the pilot was the owner or operator of the airplane.\n\n4. **Payment of Flight**: The passenger did not pay to go on the flight. This is a factual issue that could affect the outcome of the case, but it does not directly determine whether the plaintiff can recover under negligence or strict liability.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely result is that the plaintiffs will not recover, because the passenger did not pay to go on the flight."
