The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held\n\nA. enforceable.\nB. unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.\nC. unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.\nD. unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.\n"

In this case, the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with 15,000 boxes for the first month, which is a unilateral promise. However, the producer's oral agreement to sell an unusually large number of widgets for the first month would be considered a violation of the parol evidence rule, making the oral agreement unenforceable."
