A negative cross-price elasticity\n\nA negative cross-price elasticity indicates that an increase in the price of one good leads to a decrease in the demand for the other good. This suggests that the two goods are complements, as an increase in the price of one good would make it less attractive to consume, thereby increasing the demand for the other good."
