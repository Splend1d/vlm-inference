P or wage rate of labor > MRP of labor and with one additional unit of labor, wage rate < MRP.\n\nThis statement is based on the concept of marginal revenue product (MRP) and the law of diminishing marginal returns. According to the law of diminishing marginal returns, as more units of a variable input are added to a fixed amount of a fixed input, the marginal product of the variable input decreases. This means that the marginal revenue generated by adding one more unit of the variable input will be less than the marginal revenue generated by adding one more unit of the fixed input.\n\nTherefore, if the wage rate of labor is greater than the marginal revenue product of labor, then adding one more unit of labor will result in a lower wage rate and a higher marginal revenue, which is consistent with the law of diminishing marginal returns."
