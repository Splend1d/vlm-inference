The 80-acre tract included the family home, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist. For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers. Each deed contained the following provisions:\"It is an express covenant and condition that the property hereby conveyed shall not be used for other than single-family residences. \"\"The grantor hereby covenants for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to insert a similar restriction in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80- acre tract. \"In 1996, the county board of supervisors purchased from the attorney 30 lots within the 80-acre tract. The board, which had the power of eminent domain, planned to construct a new county pest-control office on the property. The deed of conveyance from the attorney to the county board of supervisors made no mention of the aforesaid restrictions contained in the deeds to other lot owners in the 80-acre tract. The attorney \u0080\u0094county deed, however, did contain a provision, which stated:\"The grantee hereby covenants for itself, its successors, and assigns that this conveyance is made in lieu of the exercise of the power of eminent domain. \"Thereafter, the county enacted a zoning ordinance whereby the 30 lots were rezoned to permit the construction of a pest-control office building.

Let's break down the key points and analyze each option:\n\n1. **The 80-acre tract was purchased by an attorney in 1980.**\n2. **The tract included a family home and an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist.**\n3. **In 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area.**\n4. **By the early 1990s, prosperity had burst upon the area.**\n5. **The attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots.**\n6. **In 1996, the county board of supervisors purchased 30 lots within the 80-acre tract.**\n7. **The county board of supervisors planned to construct a new county pest-control office on the property.**\n8. **The deed of conveyance from the attorney to the county board of supervisors made no mention of the restrictions contained in the deeds to other lot owners in the 80-acre tract.**\n9. **The attorney's deed stated that the grantee would insert similar restrictions in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80-acre tract.**\n10. **The county enacted a zoning ordinance whereby the 30 lots were rezoned to permit the construction of a pest-control office building.**\n11. **All other lot owners in the 80-acre tract brought suit to enjoin the building plan or, in the alternative, to recover damages.**\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nA. **The power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.**\n   - This option suggests that the county's zoning ordinance is equivalent to the power of eminent domain. However, the zoning ordinance was enacted after the purchase of the tract, and the county board of supervisors had the power of eminent domain before the zoning ordinance was enacted. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nB. **The purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.**\n   - This option suggests that the county's purchase of the tract was an act of inverse condemnation. However, the county board of supervisors had the power of eminent domain before the zoning ordinance was enacted, and the zoning ordinance was enacted after the purchase. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nC. **The abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.**\n   - This option suggests that the restriction on land use cannot be enforced against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions. However, the restriction on land use can be enforced against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nD. **Restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.**\n   - This option suggests that the restrictions on land use can only be enforced against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions. However, the restriction on land use can be enforced against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe correct answer is **C. The abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.**"
