The President's order allows an exception to the extent that emergency circumstances require different hours of operation (as in the case of federal hospitals). When Congress enacted the appropriations statute for operating all federal executive agencies, its members assumed that the offices of those agencies would be open five days per week, but Congress did not include such a requirement in its appropriations statute or in any other statute. Is the President's order constitutional?\n\nA. No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.\nB. No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.\nC. Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.\nD. Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.\n"

While this is true, it does not directly address the constitutional basis of the President's order.\n   - **Option B**: This option states that members of Congress assumed that the agencies' offices would be open five days per week. This is a factual statement about the historical assumption, but it does not address the constitutional basis of the President's order.\n   - **Option C**: This option asserts that the President has plenary authority to manage the executive branch. This is a broad assertion that does not directly address the specific constitutional issue at hand.\n   - **Option D**: This option states that the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute. This is a valid point, but it does not directly address the constitutional basis of the President's order.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most relevant and direct question is whether the President's order is constitutional. The key point here is that the President's order is based on an appropriation statute for operating federal executive agencies, which does not explicitly require the offices to be open five days per week. Therefore, the President's order is not directly prohibited by any statute.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.**"
