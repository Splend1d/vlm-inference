According to this curve, words are recalled in the order in which they are presented, with the most recent words being recalled first.\n\nGiven the list of words presented in the order: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad, the participant is most likely to forget the word \"computer\" because it is the second word in the list. According to the serial position curve, words are recalled in the order of their presentation, so the participant is most likely to forget the word that is recalled last.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD.
