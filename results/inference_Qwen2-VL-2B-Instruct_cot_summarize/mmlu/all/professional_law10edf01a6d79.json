The security guard knew that the barber, an elderly man, had a history of significant heart problems. The security guard decided to play a joke on his friend. The security guard took out his gun, burst through the door of the barber shop, pointed the gun at the friend, and shouted, \"Don't move or I'll shoot!\" The barber, thinking that an armed intruder was about to shoot the friend, suffered a heart attack and collapsed. If the barber brings suit against the security guard for infliction of emotional distress and seeks recovery for damages arising from the heart attack, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present.\nB. prevail, because the security guard assaulted the friend.\nC. not prevail, because the barber was not a member of the friend's immediate family.\nD. not prevail, because the resulting harm was unforeseeable.\n"

The security guard's decision to burst through the door and point a gun at the friend was not a reasonable or appropriate response to the situation. The security guard's actions were not necessary to protect the friend, and the resulting heart attack was not a foreseeable consequence of the security guard's actions.\n\nTherefore, the security guard should not prevail in the case of the barber bringing suit against him for infliction of emotional distress and seeking recovery for damages arising from the heart attack. The correct answer is:\n\nD. not prevail, because the resulting harm was unforeseeable."
