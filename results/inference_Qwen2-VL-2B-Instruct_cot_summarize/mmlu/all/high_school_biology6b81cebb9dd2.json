Infant suckling causes a mother's brain to release oxytocin, which in turn stimulates milk production.\n\nPositive feedback occurs when a change in a system leads to a further increase in the same change. In this case, the increase in oxytocin production by the mother's brain leads to more milk production, creating a positive feedback loop. This is an example of positive feedback in the endocrine system."
