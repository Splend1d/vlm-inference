                    "text": "To determine which accomplishment of the political movement that was organized around sentiments similar to the one in the song lyrics above, we need to analyze the context and the core of the song's message.\n\nThe song \"The Hayseed\" is a critique of the political system and the role of the wealthy and powerful in controlling the economy and the lives of the common people. The lyrics express the feeling of oppression and exploitation by the wealthy and the lack of control over one's life.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Establishment of the minimum wage law.**\n   - The minimum wage law is a direct action to address economic inequality and protect workers. It is a measure to ensure that workers receive a minimum amount of money per hour, which is a direct response to the oppression and exploitation felt by the common people.\n\nB. **Enactment of laws regulating railroads.**\n   - While railroads are mentioned in the song, the focus is on the oppression of the common people rather than the regulation of railroads. This option does not directly address the oppression felt by the common people.\n\nC. **Shift in U.S. currency from the gold standard to the silver standard.**\n   - The shift from the gold standard to the silver standard was a significant economic change that had a profound impact on the economy and the lives of people. However, it was not directly related to the oppression felt by the common people.\n\nD. **Creation of a price-support system for small-scale farmers.**\n   - The price-support system for small-scale farmers is a measure to protect farmers from market fluctuations and ensure a stable supply of food. While it is a positive step, it does not directly address the oppression felt by the common people.\n\nGiven the context and the core message of the song, the accomplishment that directly addresses the oppression and exploitation of the common people is:\n\n**A. Establishment of the minimum wage law.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Establishment of the minimum wage law."
