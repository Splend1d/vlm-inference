The man was subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to a prison term for the burglary. Three years later, while the man was serving his prison sentence for the burglary, a police detective from a nearby town questioned him about an unsolved homicide. The detective did not know that the man had invoked Miranda at an earlier time. that the man had invoked Miranda at an earlier time. The man waived his Miranda rights and made several incriminating statements to the detective. When he was later charged with the homicide, the man moved to suppress these statements, claiming that his earlier refusal to waive his Miranda rights should have been honored. Should the court suppress the statements?\n\nA. No, because the detective was unaware that the man had originally invoked his Miranda rights.\nB. No, because the man's prior invocation of his Miranda rights did not preclude the later interrogation.\nC. Yes, because the man had earlier invoked his Miranda rights, and the police were not permitted to resume questioning, even after a time lapse of years.\nD. Yes, because the man was incarcerated, and his earlier invocation of his Miranda rights shielded him from further questioning until shielded him from further questioning until he was released.\n"

Yes, because the man had earlier invoked his Miranda rights, and the police were not permitted to resume questioning, even after a time lapse of years.\n\nThe principle behind this answer is that the police cannot question a person who has invoked their Miranda rights. This is a fundamental aspect of the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. The man's earlier refusal to waive his Miranda rights meant that the police could not question him further after he invoked his rights. Therefore, the statements made by the man during the subsequent interrogation were not admissible in court.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because the detective was unaware that the man had originally invoked his Miranda rights.\n   - This option is incorrect because the man's earlier refusal to waive his Miranda rights was a fact known to the police.\n\nB. No, because the man's prior invocation of his Miranda rights did not preclude the later interrogation.\n   - This option is incorrect because the police were still able to question the man after he invoked his rights, and the statements made during the subsequent interrogation were admissible.\n\nD. Yes, because the man was incarcerated, and his earlier invocation of his Miranda rights shielded him from further questioning until he was released.\n   - This option is incorrect because the man's earlier refusal to waive his Miranda rights did not prevent the police from questioning him after he was released from prison."
