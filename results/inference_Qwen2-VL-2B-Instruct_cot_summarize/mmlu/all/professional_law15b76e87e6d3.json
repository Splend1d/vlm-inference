Liability is based on a statute making owners of automobiles liable for the negligent actions of those driving with the consent of the owner of the vehicle. The plaintiff offered into evidence the testimony of his doctor that the plaintiff had said to the doctor, when consulting the doctor for treatment, that he felt pain in his back immediately after the accident, and that pain persisted. The trial court should rule this testimony\n\nA. admissible as a spontaneous declaration.\nB. admissible under the hearsay exception of declaration of present bodily condition.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible as conclusions.\n"

The hearsay exception allows for the admission of statements made by a person who is unavailable to testify, but it does not apply to statements made by a doctor who is present at the time of the accident and who is qualified to diagnose and treat the plaintiff's injuries. Therefore, the trial court should rule this testimony inadmissible."
