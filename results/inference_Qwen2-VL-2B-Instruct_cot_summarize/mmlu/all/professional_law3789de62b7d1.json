It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax\n\nA. constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.\nB. constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.\n"

The tax is imposed on the studios, which are businesses, and not on the photographers who use the studios. This discriminatory nature of the tax is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits states from discriminating against individuals based on their occupation or business activity.\n\nTherefore, the city's excise tax on commercial photographic studios is unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce."
