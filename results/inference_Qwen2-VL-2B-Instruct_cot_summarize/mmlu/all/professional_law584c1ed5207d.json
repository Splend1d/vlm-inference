Late for a business appointment, a businesswoman was driving north on a highway when she decided to pass the car in front of her. As she swung across the center line into the southbound lane, her vehicle collided with a fire engine. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching an owner's house, which was entirely destroyed by fire. The owner's home was located approximately one mile from the accident scene. If the owner asserts a claim against thebusinesswoman, he will most likely\n\nA. recover the fair market value of his house before the fire.\nB. recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\nC. recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire.\nD. recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.\n"

The owner of the destroyed house was located approximately one mile from the accident scene, which suggests that the traffic statute was not intended to protect against the specific type of harm that occurred in this case. The owner's house was destroyed by fire, which is not a typical consequence of a traffic violation. Therefore, the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered, and the owner cannot recover from the businesswoman."
