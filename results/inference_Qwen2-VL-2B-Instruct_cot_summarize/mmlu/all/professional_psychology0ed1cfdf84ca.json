For each infant, the length of nighttime crying will depend on the level of arousal.\n\nAccording to traditional leaning theories, the length of crying episodes is influenced by the level of arousal, which is the intensity of the infant's emotional state. In family A, the infant is delayed in responding to the crying, which could indicate that the infant is more aroused and therefore more likely to cry for longer periods of time at night. In family B, the infant receives immediate attention, which could indicate that the infant is less aroused and therefore less likely to cry for longer periods of time at night."
