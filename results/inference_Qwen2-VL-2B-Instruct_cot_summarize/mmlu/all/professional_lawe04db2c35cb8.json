In this case, the son's interest in the property is a perpetuity, as it is intended to continue indefinitely.\n\nHowever, the son's interest is not void under the Rule against Perpetuities because it is an executory interest of a shifting type. An executory interest of a shifting type is one that is intended to continue indefinitely, but it is not intended to continue indefinitely. In other words, the son's interest is intended to continue indefinitely, but it is not intended to continue indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. It is an executory interest of a shifting type."
