The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (num MOD 1) = 0\n- This option checks if the remainder of dividing num by 1 is 0. Since 1 is an odd number, this condition will be true for odd numbers. However, it does not guarantee that the number is odd, as it only checks for the remainder of dividing by 1, which is not sufficient to determine if the number is odd or even.\n\nB. (num MOD 1) = 1\n- This option checks if the remainder of dividing num by 1 is 1. Since 1 is an odd number, this condition will be true for odd numbers. However, it does not guarantee that the number is odd, as it only checks for the remainder of dividing by 1, which is not sufficient to determine if the number is odd or even.\n\nC. (num MOD 2) = 0\n- This option checks if the remainder of dividing num by 2 is 0. Since 2 is an even number, this condition will be true for even numbers. However, it does not guarantee that the number is odd, as it only checks for the remainder of dividing by 2, which is not sufficient to determine if the number is odd or even.\n\nD. (num MOD 2) = 1\n- This option checks if the remainder of dividing num by 2 is 1. Since 2 is an even number, this condition will be true for even numbers. However, it does not guarantee that the number is odd, as it only checks for the remainder of dividing by 2, which is not sufficient to determine if the number is odd or even.\n\nNone of the given options directly determine if the number is odd or even. However, since the code fragment is intended to display \"odd\" if the positive number num is odd, the correct condition to replace the <MISSING CONDITION> is:\n\nB. (num MOD 1) = 1\n\nThis condition checks if the remainder of dividing num by 1 is 1, which is equivalent to checking if num is odd."
