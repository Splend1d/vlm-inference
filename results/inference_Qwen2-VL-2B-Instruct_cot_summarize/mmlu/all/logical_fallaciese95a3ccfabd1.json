A disjunctive syllogism consists of three parts:\n- The first part is a disjunction (a statement that asserts the existence of at least one or more than one option).\n- The second part is a negation (a statement that asserts the absence of a certain option).\n- The third part is a conjunction (a statement that asserts the existence of at least one option).\n\nIn the given statement:\n- The first part is a disjunction: \"Each term must be used twice.\"\n- The second part is a negation: \"No more.\"\n- The third part is a conjunction: \"No less.\"\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Each term must be used twice, no more and no less\" is a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Disjunctive"
