By making sure the high-watt security light doesn't aim in their neighbor's bedroom window, they are causing harm to their neighbor's property and potentially causing discomfort or inconvenience. This is a clear violation of the principle of respecting others' property rights and the right to privacy.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is swinging a pillow at their best friend James. This action is not clearly morally wrong. Swinging a pillow at someone is generally considered a harmless and non-violent form of communication, and it is not considered a violation of the right to privacy or property rights. However, it is important to note that the behavior may be perceived differently by different individuals and contexts, and it is always important to consider the potential impact on others and to act with care and consideration."
