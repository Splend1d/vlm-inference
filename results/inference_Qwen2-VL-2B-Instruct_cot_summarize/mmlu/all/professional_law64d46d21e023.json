The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: \"2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery.\" The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?\n\nA. No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.\nB. No, because the agreement was completely integrated.\nC. Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.\nD. Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n"

The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece).\n\n2. **Analysis of Evidence**: The studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. This evidence is relevant because it provides context about how the studio industry typically prices such sets.\n\n3. **Admissibility of Evidence**: The admissibility of evidence depends on whether it is relevant to the contract and whether it is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n\n- **Relevance**: The studio's evidence is relevant because it provides a basis for understanding the pricing structure of the studio industry, which is relevant to the contract.\n- **Meaning**: The studio's evidence is offered to give meaning to the contract. It suggests that the studio industry typically prices cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece basis, which is relevant to the contract.\n\nGiven these points, the studio's evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the contract and offers meaning to the contract.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.**"
