Since 2^2 is a factor of 336, 336 is powerful.\n\nC. 300\n- Prime factors of 300 are 2, 2, 3, and 5. Since 2^2 is not a factor of 300, 300 is not powerful.\n\nD. 297\n- Prime factors of 297 are 3 and 3. Since 3^2 is a factor of 297, 297 is powerful.\n\nTherefore, the powerful numbers are B. 336 and D. 297. The correct answer is D."
