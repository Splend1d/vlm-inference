Apes have been able to use the words they know to express novel concepts.\n\nThis option provides the strongest evidence for the idea that animals are capable of developing and using a sophisticated language. It demonstrates that apes, which are primates, can use words to communicate novel concepts, which is a critical aspect of language development. The other options either do not directly relate to the development of language or are not supported by scientific evidence."
