                    "text": "The rotational correlation time \u03c4c is proportional to the molecular volume V. Therefore, we can estimate \u03c4c for a small protein with Mr = 8400 by using the following equation:\n\n\u03c4c = kBT / (Mr * V)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, B is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and V is the molecular volume.\n\nFirst, we need to find the molecular volume V. The molecular volume V can be calculated using the molecular weight Mr and the density \u03c1 of the liquid. The molecular volume V can be expressed as:\n\nV = Mr * \u03c1\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density of the liquid.\n\nNext, we can use the Stokes equation to find the rotational correlation time \u03c4c:\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kBT\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the viscosity of the liquid, r is the radius of the spherical object, and kBT is the thermal energy.\n\nWe can use the given values to estimate \u03c4c for a small protein with Mr = 8400:\n\n\u03c4c = kBT / (Mr * V)\n\n\u03c4c = kBT / (8400 * \u03c1)\n\nWe can use the given values to estimate the density \u03c1 of water at 298 K:\n\n\u03c1 = 1000 kg/m^3\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the equation:\n\n\u03c4c = kBT / (8400 * 1000)\n\n\u03c4c = kBT / 840000\n\n\u03c4c = 1.381 * 10^-23 * 298 * 10^3 / 840000\n\n\u03c4c = 4.2 ns\n\nTherefore, the rotational correlation time \u03c4c for a small protein with Mr = 8400 is 4.2 ns. The correct answer is C. 4.2 ns."
