                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the principle that a government cannot do more than protect its people.\n2. It mentions that the government is demanding contributions for the mitigation of distress, which is reversing its function.\n3. It argues that the fundamental law is to ensure freedom to do all that one wills, provided one does not infringe on the equal freedom of others.\n4. It contrasts this with the idea of insuring satisfaction, which is separate from the protection of the people.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor**: The passage does not explicitly state that Spencer opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor. It discusses the principle of protection but does not delve into the specific use of tax money.\n\nB. **challenged the government's right to tax the people**: The passage does not explicitly challenge the government's right to tax the people. It discusses the principle of protection and the reversal of the government's function.\n\nC. **believed that the government should do more than merely protect its people**: The passage suggests that the government should do more than merely protect its people, as it reverses its function by demanding contributions for the mitigation of distress. This aligns with the idea of doing more than merely protecting.\n\nD. **believed that working people should unite for a common cause**: The passage does not discuss the idea of working people uniting for a common cause. It focuses on the principle of protection and the reversal of the government's function.\n\nAfter analyzing the passage, the most accurate inference is:\n\n**C. believed that the government should do more than merely protect its people**"
