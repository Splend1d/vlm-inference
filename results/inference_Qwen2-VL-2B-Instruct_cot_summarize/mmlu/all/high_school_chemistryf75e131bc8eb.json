Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a molecule.\n\n1. **Calcium (Ca)**: Electronegativity is approximately 1.9.\n2. **Cesium (Cs)**: Electronegativity is approximately 2.1.\n3. **Sulfur (S)**: Electronegativity is approximately 2.5.\n4. **Chromium (Cr)**: Electronegativity is approximately 2.2.\n5. **Nitrogen (N)**: Electronegativity is approximately 2.5.\n6. **Iodine (I)**: Electronegativity is approximately 2.6.\n\nBased on the electronegativity values, the second element with the larger electronegativity is **Cesium (Cs)**, which has an electronegativity of 2.1. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Chlorine, iodine"
