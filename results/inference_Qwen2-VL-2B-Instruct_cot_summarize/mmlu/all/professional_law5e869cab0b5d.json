The mall has a Social Security Office and the real estate is owned by the state. The grocery store pays rent to the state. Any type of picketers are prevented from entering the mall to picket inside by the owners of the mall, who also pay rent to the state for the land, and there is no outside entrance of the store at the mall where the picketers could strike. If the picketers go before the court to claim violations of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, will state action likely be found against the store and the mall owners?\n\nA. No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\nB. No, because a private actor can never be held liable in a constitutional rights claim that requires state action.\nC. Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.\nD. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n"

The mall itself is owned by the corporation, and the grocery store pays rent to the state.\n\n2. **State's Role**: The mall and the grocery store are owned by the corporation, which is a private actor. The mall pays rent to the state, and the grocery store pays rent to the state.\n\n3. **Connection Between the State and the Private Actions**: The mall and the grocery store are owned by the corporation, which is a private actor. The mall pays rent to the state, and the grocery store pays rent to the state. This means that the mall and the grocery store are part of the same entity, and the state has a direct interest in the property they occupy.\n\n4. **Balancing Test**: The balancing test involves determining whether the state has a direct interest in the private actions of the mall and the store. If the state has a direct interest, it can be held liable for the private actions of the mall and the store.\n\nGiven these points, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the mall and the grocery store are part of the same entity and that the state has a direct interest in the property they occupy, which makes the mall and the store part of state action."
