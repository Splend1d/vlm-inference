Because an acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.\n\nInfections and inflammatory states can lead to an acute phase response, which involves the body's response to inflammation. This response can alter the distribution of certain micronutrients between different tissues, potentially leading to misleading results in biochemical indices of micronutrient status. For example, an increase in the concentration of certain micronutrients in the plasma or serum may not accurately reflect their true levels in the body, as they may be distributed differently in the inflamed tissues."
