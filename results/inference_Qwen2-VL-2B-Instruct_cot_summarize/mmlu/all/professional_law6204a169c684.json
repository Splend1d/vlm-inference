He often sold and leased his guard dogs to various business and factory owners who used the guard dogs to frighten away intruders from entering their premises at night. One evening, the breeder was in the back yard of his home training three of his guard dogs. The back yard was enclosed with a chain link fence and a latched gate that prevented the dogs from running out. After the training session, the breeder opened the gate and permitted the dogs to run loose in his front yard. Minutes later, a man was walking along the sidewalk in front of the breeder's house when he was attacked by one of the dogs. The man suffered severe injuries and died as a result of the attack. The breeder should be found guilty of\n\nA. murder.\nB. involuntary manslaughter.\nC. voluntary manslaughter.\nD. reckless endangerment.\n"

In this case, the breeder intentionally trained his guard dogs to attack strangers at night, but the dogs did not intend to cause the man's death. The man was attacked by one of the dogs, and the breeder's actions were not intended to cause the man's death. Therefore, the breeder should be found guilty of voluntary manslaughter."
