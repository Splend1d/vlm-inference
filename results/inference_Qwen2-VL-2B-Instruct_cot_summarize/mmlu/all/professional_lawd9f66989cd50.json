The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\nB. admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.\nC. inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.\nD. inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.\n"

Irrelevancy occurs when the testimony is not relevant to the issues at hand. In this case, the sister's testimony about the doors swinging inward after the accident is irrelevant to the customer's claim that the doors were programmed to swing outward, which is the core issue in the lawsuit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy."
