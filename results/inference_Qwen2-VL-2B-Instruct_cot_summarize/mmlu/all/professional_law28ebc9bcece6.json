In order to ensure the availability of sites for the disposal of spent fuel from the nuclear power plant, the state refused to supply electric power to out- of-state purchasers residing in states that would not accept spent fuel from the plant for storage or disposal. Assume that no federal statute applies. Which of the following is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional?\n\nA. A state may condition the sale to out-of-state purchasers of any products produced in that state on the willingness of those purchasers to bear the fair share of the environmental costs of producing those products.\nB. The generation of electricity is intrastate by nature and therefore subject to plenary state control.\nC. The state itself owns and operates the power system, and therefore its refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause.\nD. The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which argument is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional, we need to analyze each option in the context of the given scenario.\n\n1. **Option A**: \"A state may condition the sale to out-of-state purchasers of any products produced in that state on the willingness of those purchasers to bear the fair share of the environmental costs of producing those products.\"\n   - This option suggests that the state can condition the sale of products on environmental costs. However, it does not directly address the issue of the state's refusal to supply electric power to out-of-state purchasers. It is more about the environmental costs rather than the state's refusal to supply power.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"The generation of electricity is intrastate by nature and therefore subject to plenary state control.\"\n   - This option supports the idea that the state has the authority to regulate its own electricity generation. However, it does not directly address the specific issue of the state refusing to supply power to out-of-state purchasers.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"The state itself owns and operates the power system, and therefore its refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause.\"\n   - This option suggests that the state's refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause. The commerce clause generally prohibits states from regulating interstate commerce. However, this option does not directly address the specific issue of the state's refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\"\n   - This option suggests that the state's refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens. This option directly addresses the constitutional issue by suggesting that the state's refusal to supply power is a rational response to the environmental concerns of the nuclear power plant and the disposal of spent fuel.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis, **Option D** is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional. It directly addresses the state's refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers as a rational response to the environmental concerns of the nuclear power plant and the disposal of spent fuel, which is a direct concern for the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n\n**Final Answer: D**"
