During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\nA. Median nerve at the wrist\nB. Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\nC. Radial nerve at the forearm\nD. Ulnar nerve at the elbow\n"

This is because the median nerve is the most common nerve to be entrapped in the wrist region, particularly in individuals who have played sports that involve repetitive wrist movements, such as baseball or softball. The symptoms described, including numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers, are consistent with median nerve entrapment. The other nerves listed (musculocutaneous, radial, and ulnar) do not typically cause symptoms in the hand and wrist region."
