Therefore, (2,2) is the least risky pair with a return of 2%.\n\nNext, we compare (2,2) and (4,2). Both have the same standard deviation of 0, but the return for (4,2) is 2%, while the return for (2,2) is 2%. Therefore, (4,2) is the most risky pair with a return of 2%.\n\nFinally, we compare (2,2) and (2,3).
