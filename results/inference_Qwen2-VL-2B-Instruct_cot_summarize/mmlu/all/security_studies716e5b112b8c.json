The security dilemma can be utilised as a force for stabilising the international environment, placing all states at equal risk of military attack and discouraging a counter-productive accumulation of military force; the impact of security dilemmas is largely restricted to the realm of military security, although this can have far-reaching effects.\nB. The security dilemma arises out of the anarchic international system that is conceptualized by realists. Within this environment, states are obliged to seek security through their own military efforts; this is perceived as threatening to other states and so triggers an arms race spiral. The security dilemma has implications for security sectors other than the military, particularly the political and societal security sectors.\nC. The term security dilemma refers to the state of constant insecurity that is inherent to the traditional realist paradigm of international security. Security dilemmas will have most notable effects on human and societal security, typically outweighing the initial implications on traditional security domains such as the political and military sphere.\nD. Security dilemmas have implications for other realms of security beside the military domain, although their effect on societal security is limited. The term primarily refers to the ways in which states conceptualize their own military capabilities with regards to those around them.\n"

This choice can lead to a spiral of arms race and military buildup, which can have far-reaching effects on the international security environment. The security dilemma can impact on the international security environment in various ways, including:\n\n  * It can lead to a arms race, where states are forced to build up their military capabilities in order to protect themselves.\n  * It can lead to a proliferation of weapons and military technology, which can have negative consequences for the environment and human security.\n  * It can lead to a decline in international cooperation and trust, as states become more focused on their own security interests and less willing to work together to address global challenges.\n  * It can lead to a decline in the effectiveness of international organizations and institutions, as states become more focused on their own security interests and less willing to cooperate with others.\n\nOverall, the security dilemma can have a significant impact on the international security environment, and it is important for states to work together to address global challenges and promote peace and stability."
