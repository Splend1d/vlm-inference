After exhausting his appeals, he filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. He established that his counsel had not advised him of the benefits of plea bargaining, and had withheld several offers for guilty pleas from the government. The offers expired for lack of a response. The sentence he received was at least seven to eight years more than if he had entered a guilty plea. Will the court likely decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel?\n\nA. Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\nB. No, because plea bargaining is not a critical necessity in a criminal case and counsel has no duty to discuss such options with the defendant.\nC. When the defendant indicates he wants to fight the charges, there is no need for counsel to relay plea offers or discuss the options with him.\nD. Because this defendant was convicted at a fair trial he didn't lose any rights and was not prejudiced by his lawyer's mistakes.\n"

The Sixth Amendment guarantees that a defendant has the right to be represented by an attorney who is \"competent, diligent, and informed.\" This means that the attorney must have the necessary skills and knowledge to understand the case and advocate effectively on behalf of the defendant.\n\nIn this case, the defendant's counsel failed to advise him of the benefits of plea bargaining, which is a critical aspect of the criminal process. The defendant was denied the opportunity to negotiate a plea deal, which could have resulted in a lighter sentence or even a dismissal of the charges. The defendant also lost several offers for guilty pleas from the government, which could have led to a more favorable outcome.\n\nGiven that the defendant was convicted at a fair trial and his counsel did not provide the necessary assistance, it is likely that the court will decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective."
