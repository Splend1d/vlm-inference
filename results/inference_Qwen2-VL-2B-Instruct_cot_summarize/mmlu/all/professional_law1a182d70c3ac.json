The landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal. For the next 15 years, the agency held the property but did not implement an educational use for it. In year 16, the agency abandoned the intended education use and sold it at a properly advertised auction under state law. The original landowner appealed, arguing that the agency only took a fee simple determinable and when it ceased its intended educational use, superior fee simple title reverted back to the original owner. Will the appellate court likely rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer?\n\nA. No, because the state also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession.\nB. No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\nC. Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\nD. Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the state can assert fee simple title over the landowner's fee simple determinable title, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Statutory Requirements**: The state education agency obtained the land through eminent domain, which is a legal process that requires the acquisition of property for a public use. The landowner accepted the fair market value award and did not appeal, indicating that the agency had the authority to acquire the land for educational purposes.\n\n2. **Eminent Domain**: The state agency's acquisition of the land through eminent domain is a legal process that grants the agency the right to take property for a public use. This is a fundamental principle in land law, and the agency has the authority to acquire the land for educational purposes.\n\n3. **Fee Simple Determinable**: The original landowner accepted the fair market value award and did not appeal, which means they accepted the fee simple determinable title. This means that the agency has the right to take the land for a public use, and the original owner has no right to stop the transfer.\n\n4. **Adverse Possession**: The original owner has no right to stop the transfer because the agency has the right to take the land for a public use. Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows the owner to retain possession of land for a period of time, but it does not grant the owner fee simple title.\n\n5. **Public Use**: The state agency's acquisition of the land for educational purposes is a public use, which is a fundamental principle in land law. The agency has the authority to acquire the land for educational purposes, and the original owner has no right to stop the transfer.\n\nGiven these points, the state can assert fee simple title over the original owner's fee simple determinable title because the agency has the authority to acquire the land for a public use, and the original owner has no right to stop the transfer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition."
