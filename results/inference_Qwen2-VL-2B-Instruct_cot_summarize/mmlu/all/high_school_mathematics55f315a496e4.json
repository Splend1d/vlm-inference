In this case, the random variable is the larger of the two numbers rolled, and the outcomes are the numbers rolled on the two dice.\n\nThe possible outcomes when rolling two dice are the six numbers from 1 to 6, so there are 6 outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number less than the larger number is $\\frac{5}{6}$, because there are 5 numbers less than the larger number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and 1 number greater than the larger number (6).\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than the larger number is $\\frac{1}{6}$, because there is only 1 number greater than the larger number (6).\n\nSo, the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled is $\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 6 = \\frac{5}{6} + 1 = \\frac{11}{6}$.\n\nHowever, this is not in the form of a fraction with a numerator of 161. To get a fraction with a numerator of 161, we need to multiply the expected value by $\\frac{6}{6} = \\frac{1}{1}$.\n\nSo, the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled is $\\frac{11}{6} \\cdot \\frac{6}{6} = \\frac{11}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1} = \\frac{11}{6}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{161}{6}}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{161}{6}}$."
