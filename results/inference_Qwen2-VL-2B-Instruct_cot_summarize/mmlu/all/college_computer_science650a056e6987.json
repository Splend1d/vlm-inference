However, since the product is used by 100 customers, we need to consider the time it is not available due to failures and repairs.\n\nThe mean time to repair is 20 hours, which means that on average, the product will need to be repaired 20 times before it is fully operational again. Since the product is used by 100 customers, we need to consider the time it takes for each customer to use the product and then the time it takes for the product to be repaired.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 10,000 hours * 100 customers = 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 10,000 hours * 100 customers = 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for use is the product's MTBF times the number of customers, which is 1,000,000 hours.\n\nThe total time available for repair is the product's MTBF times the"
