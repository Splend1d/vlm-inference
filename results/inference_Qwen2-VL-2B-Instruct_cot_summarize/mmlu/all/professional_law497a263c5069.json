A deposition of a person against whom another person contemplates filing an action may be compelled by the party contemplating the action, without leave of court, before the action is filed.\n   - This statement is true. A party contemplating filing an action can compel a deposition of a person against whom they have a claim without the need for leave of court.\n\nII. A deposition of the defendant in an action may be taken by the plaintiff without service of a subpoena on the defendant.\n   - This statement is false. A deposition of the defendant in an action must be served with a subpoena on the defendant before it can be taken.\n\nIII. A deposition may be taken even though all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at the trial.\n   - This statement is false. A deposition is typically taken to gather evidence that will be admissible at trial, and if all the testimony secured by it is inadmissible, it would not be admissible at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. I and II only."
