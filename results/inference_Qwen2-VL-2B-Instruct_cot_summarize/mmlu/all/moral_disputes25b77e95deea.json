This difference is directly relevant to the moral implications of Fred's actions.\n\n2. **Option B: The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.**\n   - This option discusses the necessity of the suffering for gustatory pleasure versus the byproduct nature of the suffering due to economic considerations. This is a significant difference in the moral implications of Fred's actions versus the general behavior of meat-eaters.\n\n3. **Option C: Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.**\n   - This option highlights the ability of Fred to prevent the suffering of the puppies versus the inability of meat-eaters to prevent the suffering of the animals they consume. This is a direct moral difference.\n\n4. **Option D: none of the above.**\n   - This option suggests that there are no morally relevant differences between Fred's behavior and the behavior of the consumers of factory-raised meat. However, the provided options clearly indicate that there are differences, so this option is incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, the differences that Norcross does discuss are:\n\n- Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies.\n- Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies specifically.\n- Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas the behavior of meat-eaters \"merely\" involves the suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like.**"
