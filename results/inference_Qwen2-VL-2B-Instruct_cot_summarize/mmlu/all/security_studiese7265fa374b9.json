The physical health of armed forces is a paramount concern within the traditional security paradigm, and the threat of disease is exacerbated by the physical and sociological conditions under which military personal operate, particularly during combat.\nB. The innate human fear of microbes makes them particularly amenable to being portrayed not just as important health issues, but as national-security threats as well.\nC.
