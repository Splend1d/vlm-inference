When a lawyer is called as an adverse witness, the privilege may be invoked to prevent the testimony from being admitted into evidence. The court will determine whether the privilege is applicable based on the facts of the case and the circumstances surrounding the communication. Therefore, the court will decide which privilege law to apply in this case."
