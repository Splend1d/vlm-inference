All the information in DNA codes for proteins\n\nProtein synthesis is a process in which the genetic information encoded in DNA is translated into a specific amino acid sequence in a protein. This process involves the transcription of DNA into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein by ribosomes. The information in DNA is not directly translated into proteins; instead, the genetic code is read out in a specific order to produce a specific amino acid sequence. Therefore, option A is correct."
