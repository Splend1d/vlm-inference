U.S. GDP falls and Brazil's GDP rises.\n\nWhen an American firm moves its manufacturing plant from the United States to Brazil, it typically leads to a decrease in U.S. manufacturing jobs and an increase in Brazilian manufacturing jobs. This shift in employment can have a significant impact on the U.S. economy, as it reduces the number of Americans working in the manufacturing sector. As a result, the U.S. GDP may decline due to the loss of manufacturing jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, Brazil benefits from the increased manufacturing jobs, which can boost its GDP. The increased manufacturing activity in Brazil can create new jobs, stimulate economic growth, and contribute to the country's overall economic development. Therefore, the net effect on Brazil's GDP is positive, while the net effect on the U.S. GDP is negative."
