                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the processes of water transport in the small intestine. Water transport in the small intestine involves several mechanisms, including osmosis, diffusion, and active transport.\n\n1. **Option A**: \"A 'flip-flop' mechanism efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect. The \"flip-flop\" mechanism is a term used to describe the movement of water across the enterocyte membrane, but it is not a specific mechanism for water transport. It is more of a general term for the movement of water across the membrane.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"Water flows into the gut from the mucosa, during digestion of starch and protein, in order to reduce luminal osmolality.\"\n   - This statement is correct. During digestion, water is absorbed from the mucosa into the lumen of the small intestine. This process helps to reduce the osmolality of the luminal fluid, making it less concentrated and more suitable for absorption of water and other solutes.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"Water is mostly absorbed by movement between the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via tight junctions.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect. Water absorption in the small intestine occurs primarily through the paracellular pathway, which involves the movement of water through the gaps between the cells lining the gut. Tight junctions are involved in the regulation of water and electrolyte transport across the enterocyte membrane, but they are not the primary mechanism for water absorption.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"Dietary intake of water is always greater than water movement in the small intestine.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect. The amount of water absorbed in the small intestine is generally greater than the amount of water ingested in the diet. This is because water is absorbed from the mucosa into the lumen of the small intestine, and the osmolality of the luminal fluid is reduced by this process.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. Water flows into the gut from the mucosa, during digestion of starch and protein, in order to reduce luminal osmolality.**"
