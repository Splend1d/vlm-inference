The police were looking for evidence of the husband's suspected activities in a major drug trafficking plot. The wife gave her voluntary consent to the search. The police found a kilo of cocaine in a dresser drawer and various written notes that contained the names and phone numbers of co-conspirators. After the husband was arrested, he moved for suppression of all of the evidence seized in his bedroom. Will the court likely deny the motion due to the voluntary consent given by the wife?\n\nA. No, the search was unconstitutional because a wife cannot give consent for her husband.\nB. No, the search was unconstitutional because the items were under the husband's control and the wife therefore had no authority to give consent.\nC. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\nD. The search was unconstitutional because the police did not have a search warrant.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to deny the husband's motion for suppression of the evidence seized in his bedroom. The key issue here is whether the wife's consent was voluntary and whether it was given in good faith.\n\n1. **Voluntary Consent**: The wife gave her voluntary consent to the search. This is a fundamental requirement for a search to be constitutional. The wife's consent was given voluntarily, and it was given in good faith, as she was aware of the circumstances and the purpose of the search.\n\n2. **Joint Authority**: The wife has joint authority over the property with her husband. This means that she has the right to consent on behalf of the absent occupant. The presence of joint authority does not necessarily mean that the wife has the authority to consent on behalf of the absent occupant, but it does mean that she has the right to do so.\n\n3. **Control of the Property**: The items seized in the dresser drawer were under the husband's control. This does not necessarily mean that the wife had no authority to consent. The presence of control over the items does not negate the wife's right to consent.\n\n4. **Search Warrant**: The police did not have a search warrant for the bedroom. However, the court will likely consider whether the search was conducted in a lawful manner, such as with a warrant or a court order. If the search was conducted in a lawful manner, the court may still find that the wife's consent was valid.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to deny the husband's motion for suppression due to the wife's voluntary consent and the fact that she had joint authority over the property. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant."
