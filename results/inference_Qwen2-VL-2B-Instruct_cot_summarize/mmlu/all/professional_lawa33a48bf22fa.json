The contract had a liquidated damages clause that provided for a deduction from the contract price for each day of delay in completing the bridge. The formula for the deductions from the contract price was based on how much traffic flow was turned away. The city tried to deduct the damages from the contract price. The contractor, however, pointed out that the city had not yet connected a road to the bridge so that there was no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city?\n\nA. No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\nB. Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road.\nC. Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages.\nD. No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge.\n"

The formula for the deductions is based on the amount of traffic flow that is turned away.\n\n2. **City's Actions**: The city has not yet connected a road to the bridge, which means there is no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. The city argues that there is no need to enforce the liquidated damages clause because there is no traffic flow.\n\n3. **Purpose of the Liquidated Damages Clause**: The purpose of the liquidated damages clause is to compensate the contractor for the delay in completing the bridge. The clause is designed to reflect the value of the lost traffic flow and the potential loss of revenue.\n\n4. **Analysis of the City's Breach**: The city's failure to connect a road to the bridge means that the bridge is not operational, and thus, there is no traffic flow. This directly violates the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, which is to compensate for the delay in completing the bridge.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The city's failure to connect a road to the bridge breaches the contract, and the purpose of the liquidated damages clause is to compensate for the delay in completing the bridge. Therefore, the court will uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge."
