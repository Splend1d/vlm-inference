It argues that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar, as it exercises judgment and provides language intake. The author also mentions that politics more than pedagogy retards the changing of the curriculum to fit this truth.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar: This option is not directly supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss the benefits of using language in a wide variety of situations.\n\nB. Good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar: The passage does not discuss the improvement of judgment through formal grammar study. It only states that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar.\n\nC. Analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking: The passage does not discuss the improvement of logical thinking through analyzing and diagramming. It only states that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar.\n\nD. Formal study of grammar improves writing ability: The passage does not discuss the improvement of writing ability through formal grammar study. It only states that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the option that best aligns with the passage's argument is:\n\nA. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar\n\nFinal answer: A. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar"
