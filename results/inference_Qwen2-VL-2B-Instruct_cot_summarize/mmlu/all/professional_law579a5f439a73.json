An exception to this rule would be an assignment that does not meet the criteria for being allowed by law.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk.\n- This option is an exception because it allows an assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk, which is a legal requirement.\n\nB. An assignment not allowed by law.\n- This option is an exception because it allows an assignment that is not allowed by law, which is a legal requirement.\n\nC. An assignment of future rights from future contracts.\n- This option is not an exception because it does not involve an assignment of rights from future contracts, which is not a legal requirement.\n\nD. An assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk.\n- This option is an exception because it allows an assignment that substantially changes the obligor's duty or risk, which is a legal requirement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that is not an exception is:\n\nC. An assignment of future rights from future contracts.\n\nFinal answer: C. An assignment of future rights from future contracts."
