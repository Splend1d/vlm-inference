The soil was highly acidic and aerobic, which offers excellent preservation for organic artifacts.\n\nThe nearly intact finely-made wooden spears from a 300,000-year-old site at Sch\u00f6ningen, Germany were recovered due to the highly acidic and aerobic conditions of the soil. This type of soil is known for its ability to preserve organic materials, including wood, for long periods of time. The acidic conditions help to preserve the wood by preventing the growth of bacteria and fungi that would otherwise decompose it. The aerobic conditions allow for the continued preservation of the wood by providing oxygen to the soil and preventing the buildup of organic acids that would otherwise degrade the wood."
