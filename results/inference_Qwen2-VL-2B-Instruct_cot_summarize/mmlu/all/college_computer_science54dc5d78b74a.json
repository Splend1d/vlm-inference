The cache has a write-back policy, meaning that any write to the cache will be written back to memory.\n3. The cache has 2K bytes of capacity, which is 2048 bytes.\n4. The cache has 256 elements, each of 4 bytes, so there are a total of 1024 bytes of data in the cache.\n\nSince the cache has a write-back policy, any write to the cache will be written back to memory. Therefore, the number of bytes written to memory during the execution of the loop is equal to the number of bytes in the cache, which is 1024 bytes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1024."
