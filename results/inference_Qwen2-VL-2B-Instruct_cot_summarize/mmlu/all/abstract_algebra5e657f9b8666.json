A quotient ring is a ring obtained by dividing an existing ring by an ideal. If the original ring is commutative, then the quotient ring will also be commutative because the commutativity of the original ring is preserved under quotienting.\n\nStatement 2: An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 in N.\nThis statement is false. An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if N is a maximal ideal. A maximal ideal is an ideal that is not properly contained in any other ideal. If N is a maximal ideal, then it is the only ideal that contains 1. However, if N is not a maximal ideal, then there exists another ideal M that contains 1 and is not equal to N. In this case, 1 is not in N, and the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
