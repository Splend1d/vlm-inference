Since 23 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's theorem directly on \\(3^{22}\\) modulo 23.\n\n\\[3^{22} \\equiv 3^{22} \\pmod{23}\\]\n\nSince \\(3^{22} = 3^{22} \\cdot 3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\), we can conclude that \\(3^{47} \\equiv 3^{47} \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\(3^{47} \\pmod{23}\\). Since \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}\\), we can write \\(3^{47} = 3^{47} \\cdot 3^{22} \\equiv 3^{47} \\cdot 1 \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nSince \\(3^{47} \\equiv 3^{47} \\pmod{23}\\), we can conclude that \\(3^{47} \\equiv 3^{47} \\pmod{23}\\).\n\nTherefore, the remainder of \\(3^{47}\\) when divided by 23 is \\(3^{47}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is C. 3."
