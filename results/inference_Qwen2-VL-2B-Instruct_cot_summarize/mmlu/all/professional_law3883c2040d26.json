The vintner sold the vineyard to a husband and wife as tenants in common, who did not record the warranty deed by which the vintner conveyed the vineyard to them. The husband subsequently sold and conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to a friend. The friend promptly recorded his deed. Some time later, the vintner purported to convey the vineyard to a farmer, for valuable consideration. The farmer, who had no actual knowledge of any previous conveyances of the vineyard, recorded her deed. The jurisdiction maintains alphabetical grantor and grantee indices. The applicable recording statute provides, \"Every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser of the same property (or any part thereof) in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded. \" None of the various grantees of the vineyard has entered into possession in a manner that would put anyone on inquiry notice as to their interest therein. Who owns the vineyard?\n\nA. The friend, because he recorded his deed before the farmer recorded.\nB. The friend and the wife, because the friend's deed would put the farmer on inquiry notice as to the wife's interest in the vineyard.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine who owns the vineyard, we need to analyze the sequence of conveyances and the applicable recording statute.\n\n1. **Initial Conveyance**: The vintner conveyed the vineyard to the husband and wife as tenants in common. This conveyance was properly recorded.\n\n2. **Subsequent Conveyance**: The husband conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to his friend. This conveyance was not recorded.\n\n3. **Purported Conveyance**: The vintner conveyed the vineyard to the farmer for valuable consideration. This conveyance was not recorded.\n\n4. **Jurisdictional Rule**: The applicable recording statute states that every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser of the same property (or any part thereof) in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded.\n\nGiven this information, we need to determine who owns the vineyard:\n\n- The husband and wife owned the vineyard initially.\n- The husband conveyed his interest to his friend, who did not record the conveyance.\n- The vintner conveyed the vineyard to the farmer, who did not record the conveyance.\n\nSince the husband and wife owned the vineyard initially, and the farmer did not record the conveyance, the farmer does not own the vineyard. The husband and wife owned the vineyard initially, and the vintner conveyed it to the farmer, so the farmer is the owner of the vineyard.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The farmer, because the husband \u0080\u0094friend deed is outside the farmer's chain of title.**"
