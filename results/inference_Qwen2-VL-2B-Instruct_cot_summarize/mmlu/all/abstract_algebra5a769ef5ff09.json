In the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i}, the identity element is 1, because multiplying any number by 1 leaves the number unchanged.\n\nThe inverse of a number in a group is unique, meaning that if you multiply a number by its inverse, you get the identity element. In this case, the inverse of -i is -i itself, because multiplying -i by -i gives 1, which is the identity element.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. -i"
