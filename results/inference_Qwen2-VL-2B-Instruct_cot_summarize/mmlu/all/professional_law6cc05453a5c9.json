Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be\n\nA. admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.\nB. admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.\nC. excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.\nD. excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.\n"

However, it is not relevant to the issue of whether the city was negligent in providing adequate warning at the intersection. The jury should be instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence, which means that the jury should be told that the evidence is not relevant to the issue of negligence but is instead used to suggest that the city was negligent. Therefore, the evidence should be excluded."
