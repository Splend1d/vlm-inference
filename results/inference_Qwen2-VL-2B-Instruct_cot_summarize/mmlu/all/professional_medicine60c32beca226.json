This indicates that she has a mild form of \u03b1-thalassemia. The severity of the condition is not specified, but it is clear that she has the condition.\n\n2. **Microcytic Anemia**: The man has microcytic anemia, which is a condition where red blood cells are small and have a low hemoglobin content. This is also a characteristic of \u03b1-thalassemia.\n\n3. **Single Gene Deletion**: Genetic studies show a single gene deletion. This means that the woman has one copy of the gene that causes \u03b1-thalassemia, and the man has one copy of the gene that causes microcytic anemia.\n\n4. **Two-Gene Deletion**: The man has a two-gene deletion, which means he has two copies of the gene that causes microcytic anemia. This is a condition that is not typically associated with \u03b1-thalassemia.\n\nGiven that the woman has one copy of the gene causing \u03b1-thalassemia and the man has two copies of the gene causing microcytic anemia, the woman will not have a two-gene deletion because she does not have the gene causing microcytic anemia.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion will be:\n\nA. 0%"
