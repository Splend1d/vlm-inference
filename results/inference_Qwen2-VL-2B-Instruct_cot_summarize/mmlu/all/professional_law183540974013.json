Under the proposal, the postal service would be established as a separate state agency under the direction of a postmaster general. The postal service would be responsible for the overnight or express delivery of official governmental mailings within the state. The bill further provides that all state government employees may utilize the overnight postal service at no charge for sending mailings to persons or corporations within the state. Assume that no other state has established such a postal service to date. Moreover, assume there is uncontradicted evidence that the establishment of such an independent state postal service will diminish the revenues of the U. S. Postal Service. Which of the following, if established, is the strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation?\n\nA. Under the Tenth Amendment, a state has exclusive authority to regulate transactions that are wholly intrastate.\nB. Since the proposed bill is not inconsistent with congressional postal power, it is valid under the supremacy clause.\nC. State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.\nD. There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.\n"

While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the specific issue of the proposed bill, which is about establishing an independent state postal service.\n\n**Option B: Since the proposed bill is not inconsistent with congressional postal power, it is valid under the supremacy clause.**\n\nThis argument asserts that the bill is not inconsistent with the congressional postal power, which is a constitutional principle. However, it does not directly address the specific issue of the proposed bill, which is about establishing an independent state postal service.\n\n**Option C: State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.**\n\nThis argument suggests that state employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided by Congress. While this is a relevant consideration, it does not directly address the specific issue of the proposed bill, which is about establishing an independent state postal service.\n\n**Option D: There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.**\n\nThis argument directly addresses the proposed bill by emphasizing the state's legitimate interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously. This interest aligns with the bill's purpose of establishing an independent state postal service to improve the delivery of official mailings within the state.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation is **Option D**, which highlights the state's legitimate interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously."
