This potential source of error is best described as a:\n\nA. Rosenthal effect.\nB. Hawthorne effect.\nC. carryover effect.\nD. cohort effect.\n"

In this case, older participants might have less experience using a computer than younger participants, which could affect their reaction times. This is an example of a cohort effect, where the participants in the study are not randomly selected but are instead a subset of a larger group."
