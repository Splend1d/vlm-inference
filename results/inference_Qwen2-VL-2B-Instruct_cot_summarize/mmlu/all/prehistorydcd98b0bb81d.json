All Native Americans, both ancient and modern, are derived from a single migration of Austral-Melanesians into the Americas by about 13,000 years ago.\n\nThis conclusion was drawn from a study comparing the genomes of modern people with ancient skeletal remains in North and South America. The researchers found that the genetic differences between modern Native Americans and ancient Native Americans were consistent with a single migration of people from the south of the Americas, likely Austral-Melanesians, who arrived about 13,000 years ago. This migration is believed to have led to the genetic divergence of Native Americans from their ancestors in the far north."
