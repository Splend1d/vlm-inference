After conducting the sessions, the professor submitted an expense report to the owner of the bar review course. Her expense voucher included a $225 travel expenditure to a fourth city where the professor had attended a symposium unrelated to the bar review course. The professor also submitted the $225 travel expenditure to the administrator for the faculty at the law school where she teaches. The dean of the law school had previously approved the professor's appearance at the symposium. The owner paid the professor for the symposium-related expenditure but indicated that the expense item was improperly billed to his company. The professor was indicted for false pretenses. In her defense, she contends that the double billing was the result of a bookkeeping error. Her defense should be\n\nA. valid, if her mistake was reasonable.\nB. valid, if she didn't know that the billing to the bar review company included the symposium expenditure.\nC. invalid, if her bookkeeping error was unreasonable.\nD. invalid, because white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\n"

The professor's defense that the mistake was reasonable is not valid because it would not excuse the crime. The professor's mistake was not reasonable because it was a deliberate act of fraud, which is a serious offense."
