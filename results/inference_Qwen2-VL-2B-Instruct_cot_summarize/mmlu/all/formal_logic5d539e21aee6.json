Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or\n2. China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\n\nLet's break down the sentence:\n- The first part of the sentence states that \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n- The second part states that \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. (~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n- This option suggests that \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" and \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\" This option does not directly capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nB. (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\n- This option suggests that \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" and \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\" This option does not directly capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nC. (~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 S)\n- This option suggests that \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" and \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\" This option does not directly capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nD. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n- This option suggests that \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" and \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\" This option directly captures the essence of the sentence, as it states that \"England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\" and \"China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.\"\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\nD. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)"
