During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the informer if he had recently filed an application to become a police officer. The informer responded affirmatively. The defendant's attorney then asked the informer the following question:\"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?\" The prosecuting attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule that the defendant's attorney's inquiry concerning the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is\n\nA. improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\nB. improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\nC. proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\nD. proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n"

The prosecution's objection is well-founded because the inquiry is not relevant to the defendant's guilt or the truthfulness of the informer's testimony. The prosecution's objection is based on the fact that the inquiry is not about the defendant's guilt or the truthfulness of the informer's testimony, but rather about the informer's possible bias or motive. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness."
