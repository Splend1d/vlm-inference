This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves stealing, which is a theft of someone else's property without their consent. In scenario 2, the main character decided to tattoo a symbol of loyalty on their arm. This action is generally considered morally right because it is a personal choice and a way to express one's values and beliefs."
