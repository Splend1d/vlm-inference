He landed the plane safely in a large yard behind a home located in a relatively remote area. Unfortunately, when he disembarked from the plane, he was attacked and injured by two large dogs kept by the homeowner to discourage trespassers. The homeowner, who had seen the plane land, had ordered the dogs to attack. Several months earlier, the homeowner had posted large signs around the perimeter of the yard warning of the dogs. Does the pilot have a viable claim against the homeowner for battery?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner had provided adequate warning.\nB. No, because the pilot was a trespasser.\nC. Yes, because the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity.\nD. Yes, because the pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see the warning signs posted by the homeowner.\n"

Here's a breakdown of the options:\n\nA. No, because the homeowner had provided adequate warning.\n- This option suggests that the homeowner's warning signs were sufficient to prevent the pilot's injury. If the signs were effective, the pilot would not have been injured by the dogs.\n\nB. No, because the pilot was a trespasser.\n- This option implies that the pilot was not authorized to be on the property. If the pilot was trespassing, the homeowner could argue that the pilot's injury was not due to the homeowner's actions.\n\nC. Yes, because the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity.\n- This option suggests that the pilot could claim self-defense or necessity. However, the pilot's injury was caused by the homeowner's dogs, not by the pilot's need to defend himself. The pilot's injury was not due to necessity.\n\nD. Yes, because the pilot could not reasonably be expected to see the warning signs posted by the homeowner.\n- This option suggests that the pilot was not aware of the warning signs because they were not posted where he could see them. If the signs were not visible, the pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see them.\n\nGiven the context, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the pilot could not reasonably be expected to see the warning signs posted by the homeowner.\n\nThe pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see the warning signs because they were not posted where he could see them."
