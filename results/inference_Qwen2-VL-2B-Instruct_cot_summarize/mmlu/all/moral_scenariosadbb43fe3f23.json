According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, burying a shovel in someone's skull is a clear violation of human dignity and respect for life. This action is not only morally wrong but also illegal in many jurisdictions.\n\nScenario 2 is not morally wrong. Borrowing money from a family member and using it for personal expenses is generally considered ethical and within the bounds of personal responsibility and financial responsibility. It is not considered morally wrong, as long as the borrowing is done with intention and the use of the money is within the bounds of personal responsibility and financial responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
