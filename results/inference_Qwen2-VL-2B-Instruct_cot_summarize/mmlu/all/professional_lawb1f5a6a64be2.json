The boy was mostly a benchwarmer who played only an inning or two during the game. One night, the father hid behind some shrubbery in front of the coach's home. Armed with a baseball bat, the father intended to break the coach's kneecaps when he came home from work. A man, who resembled the coach, was walking down the street. The father mistakenly believed that this man was the coach. The father jumped out of the bushes and hit the man in the kneecaps with the baseball bat. The man, who was a hemophiliac, died as a result of the injuries suffered in the beating. The father is\n\nA. guilty of attempted murder of the coach and the murder of the man.\nB. guilty of attempted murder of both the coach and the man.\nC. guilty of attempted manslaughter of the coach and murder of the man.\nD. guilty of attempted battery of the coach and murder of the man.\n"

The father intended to harm the coach, but he accidentally hit a hemophiliac man instead.\n2. The father's actions were not intentional, but they were still harmful to the man.\n3. The father's actions were not murder, as the man died as a result of injuries sustained in the beating.\n4. The father's actions were not attempted murder, as the man's death was not intended to be fatal.\n\nTherefore, the father's actions were classified as attempted battery, which is a lesser charge than attempted murder."
