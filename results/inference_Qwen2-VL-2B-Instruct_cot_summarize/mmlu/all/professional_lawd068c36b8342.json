To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by\n\nA. the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.\nB. the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.\nC. the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.\nD. the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.\n"

                    "text": "The investor's actions in this scenario are complex and involve several legal principles, including the concept of \"estoppel\" and the priority of mortgage over deed absolute. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Promissory Note and Mortgage**: The investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend and executed a promissory note for the same amount. This note was secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1 and recorded January 2. The mortgage took precedence over the promissory note because it was executed earlier in time.\n\n2. **Deed Absolute**: On February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building, naming the friend as grantee. This deed was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. It did not extinguish the investor's right to redeem the building.\n\n3. **Escrow and Delivery**: The investor delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. This arrangement was intended to prevent judicial foreclosure and to eliminate the right to redeem the building.\n\n4. **Failure to Pay**: On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the promissory note when it came due. The investor's nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded.\n\n5. **Counterclaim**: The friend counterclaimed to quiet title, arguing that the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by the investor.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n- **Option A**: The investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time. This would support the investor's claim for the right to redeem the building.\n\n- **Option B**: The investor can argue that the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption. This would support the investor's claim for the right to redeem the building.\n\n- **Option C**: The friend can argue that the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor. This would support the friend's claim for the right to retain the building.\n\n- **Option D**: The investor can argue that the friend is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement. This would support the investor's claim for the right to redeem the building.\n\nGiven the complexities and the specific legal principles involved, the court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by the investor. The investor can establish that the mortgage took precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time. Therefore, the investor's claim for the right to redeem the building should be granted.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. The investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time."
