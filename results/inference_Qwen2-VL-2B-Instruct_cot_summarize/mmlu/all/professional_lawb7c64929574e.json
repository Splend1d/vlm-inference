Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?\n\nA. It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\nB. It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.\nC. It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.\nD.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Congress's Power**: Congress has the power to enact laws affecting the District of Columbia, including the District's public thoroughfares. This power is derived from Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n2. **District of Columbia's Power**: The District of Columbia has its own legislative authority, which includes the power to enact ordinances and regulations. This power is derived from Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n3. **Interstate Commerce**: The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, which includes the District of Columbia. This power is derived from Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.**\n   - This option is correct. Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia, which means it can enact laws affecting the District without interference from other federal or state governments.\n\nB. **It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.**\n   - This option is also correct. The statute is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power, which includes the power to regulate the District of Columbia.\n\nC. **It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.**\n   - This option is incorrect. The Washington, D. C. City Council does not have exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia has its own legislative authority, which includes the power to regulate public thoroughfares.\n\nD. **It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.**\n   - This option is incorrect. The statute does not burden interstate commerce; it is a regulation of the District of Columbia's public thoroughfares.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street is:\n\n**B. It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.**"
