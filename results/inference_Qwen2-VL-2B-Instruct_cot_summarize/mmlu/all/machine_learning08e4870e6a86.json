The training error of a 1-nearest neighbor classifier is not necessarily 0. It can be 0 if the data points are perfectly clustered around the nearest neighbor, but it can also be higher if the data points are not well-separated or if the nearest neighbor is not the most likely class.\n\nStatement 2: As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant.\n This statement is true. As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate (Maximum A Posteriori estimate) will approach the MLE (Maximum Likelihood estimate) for all possible priors. This is a fundamental property of Bayesian inference, where the choice of prior does not affect the final estimate as long as the data is sufficiently large.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True."
