This is because the charge on the positive plate is equal to the charge on the negative plate, and the capacitance of the capacitor is the same for both plates. The potential difference across the capacitor is the same for both plates, and the charge on each plate is proportional to the potential difference. Therefore, the charge on the positive plate is 0.01 C."
