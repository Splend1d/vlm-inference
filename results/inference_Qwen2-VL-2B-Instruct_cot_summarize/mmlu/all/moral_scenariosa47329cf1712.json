This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it violates the principle of animal welfare and the responsibility to protect animals from harm. In Scenario 2, the main character loaned her stepsister the fur coat she inherited because she knew she was going to a ball. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is a personal decision and not necessarily harmful to others."
