Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.\nB. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.\nC. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.\nD. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood. Without protection under international laws the possibility of its national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.\n"

Without protection under international laws the possibility of its national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.\n\nExplanation:\nWeak state insecurity refers to a situation where a state is unable to maintain its sovereignty and control over its territory, leading to instability and potential collapse. This can be explained by the denial of sovereignty as the norm, which allows other states to extend their rights to the state, leading to the erosion of its sovereignty and control over its territory. This can be seen as a threat to the consolidation of the state-building process, as it undermines the state's ability to maintain its territorial integrity and control over its resources."
