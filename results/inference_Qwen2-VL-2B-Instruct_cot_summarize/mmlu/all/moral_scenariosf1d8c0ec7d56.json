However, the act of extinguishing the candle is considered morally wrong because it is a clear violation of the candle's intended purpose and the environment it was placed in. In Scenario 2, the main character used online forums to find women to date, which is generally considered a morally neutral activity. However, the act of using online forums to find potential romantic partners is considered morally wrong because it can lead to the exploitation of others and the potential for harm."
