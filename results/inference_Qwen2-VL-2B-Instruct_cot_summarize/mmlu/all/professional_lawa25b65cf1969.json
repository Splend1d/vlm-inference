The rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\n\nThis option is the most relevant because it involves a real estate company, which is a private entity, renting an apartment to an individual tenant. This scenario aligns with the intent of the new federal statute, which aims to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The statute is specifically designed to apply to leasehold contracts involving residential and commercial properties, and it is most applicable to situations where a real estate company is involved in the rental of an apartment to an individual tenant."
