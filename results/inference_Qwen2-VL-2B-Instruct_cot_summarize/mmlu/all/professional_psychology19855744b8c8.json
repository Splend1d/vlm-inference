Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **EQUIFINALITY**: This property states that the end result is the same, regardless of where you enter the system. This is a fundamental principle of systems theory, as it suggests that the overall outcome is consistent across different paths or interactions within the system.\n\nB. **WHOLENESS**: This property suggests that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a common principle in systems theory, indicating that the collective effect of the system is greater than the sum of its individual components.\n\nC. **HOMEOSTASIS**: This property refers to the system restoring its status quo when disrupted. This is a fundamental principle of systems theory, indicating that the system maintains its internal balance and stability when faced with external disturbances.\n\nD. **POSITIVE FEEDBACK**: This property suggests that disrupting homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo is incorrect. This is a principle of systems theory, indicating that maintaining homeostasis is essential for the system's stability and functioning.\n\nGiven these definitions, the property that is incorrectly defined is:\n\n**D. POSITIVE FEEDBACK\u2192 disrupting homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo**\n\nThis property is not a fundamental principle of systems theory but rather a specific aspect that needs to be maintained for the system to function properly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**D. POSITIVE FEEDBACK\u2192 disrupting homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo**"
