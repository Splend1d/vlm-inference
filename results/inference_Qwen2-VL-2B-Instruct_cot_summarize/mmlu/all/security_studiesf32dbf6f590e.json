To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.\nD.

This means that security is not a fixed, objective concept but rather a socially constructed and variable concept that is influenced by the context and the perspectives of the individuals involved."
