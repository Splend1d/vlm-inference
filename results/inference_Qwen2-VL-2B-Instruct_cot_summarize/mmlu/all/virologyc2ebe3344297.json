These viruses mutate and hence emerge\n\nEmerging viruses like Zika and Ebola continue to plague us because they can mutate and evolve over time, making them more difficult to detect and control. This can lead to the spread of the virus to new areas and populations, as well as the emergence of new variants that are more virulent or resistant to existing treatments. Additionally, the lack of effective vaccines or treatments for many of these viruses can make it difficult to contain their spread."
