The slope of the graph will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas, and the intercept will not be 0 m^3.\n\nIn an ideal gas, the volume (V) is directly proportional to the pressure (P) and inversely proportional to the temperature (T) according to the ideal gas law PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles of gas. The volume is also directly proportional to the temperature according to the equation V = nRT/V. Therefore, the volume is directly proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature. The slope of the graph will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas because the volume is directly proportional to the pressure. The intercept will not be 0 m^3 because the volume is directly proportional to the temperature, which is not zero."
