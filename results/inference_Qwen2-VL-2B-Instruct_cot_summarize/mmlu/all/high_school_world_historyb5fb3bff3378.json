The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

                    "text": "To determine which of the following changes to the Spanish policies towards Native Americans occurred on account of the practices described in the passage, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans in the mines, including torture, death, and forced labor.\n2. It mentions that the owners and stewards of the mines are tyrants who do not audit or inspect them twice a year, and do not pay for the labor of traveling or working at the mines.\n3. The passage also describes how the owners keep Indian cooking women in their residences and use them as concubines.\n4. The passage states that the owners bribe colonial officials to avoid being caught and that the protector of the Indians is powerless to prevent the harm done to the Indians.\n\nBased on this information, the passage highlights the lack of humane treatment and the exploitation of Native Americans by the Spanish authorities. This suggests that the practices described in the passage were aimed at maintaining the exploitation and subjugation of Native Americans.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The replacement of native laborers in the mines with an almost exclusively African slave workforce\n- This option is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does not discuss the replacement of Native Americans with African slaves.\n\nB. The foundation of viceroyalties to allow for more effective royal administration of native relations\n- This option is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does not discuss the establishment of viceroyalties.\n\nC. The promulgation of royal decrees insisting on more humane treatment of the natives\n- This option is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does not discuss the promulgation of royal decrees.\n\nD. The enfranchisement of all natives by local Spanish elites in the colonies\n- This option is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does not discuss the enfranchisement of Native Americans.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage describes practices that were aimed at maintaining the exploitation and subjugation of Native Americans, rather than promoting humane treatment or enfranchising them. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The promulgation of royal decrees insisting on more humane treatment of the natives"
