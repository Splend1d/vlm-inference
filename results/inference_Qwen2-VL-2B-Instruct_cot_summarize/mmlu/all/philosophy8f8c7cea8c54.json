Positive rights are rights that are inherent in the structure of the society, such as the right to life, liberty, and property. Negative rights, on the other hand, are rights that are derived from the actions of others, such as the right to be free from harm or the right to be protected from discrimination. The Singer argument argues that the distinction between positive and negative rights is a false dichotomy and that there should be a more nuanced understanding of rights that recognizes the interdependence of individuals and the society as a whole."
