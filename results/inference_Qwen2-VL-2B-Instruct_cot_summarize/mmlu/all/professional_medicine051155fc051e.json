Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?\n\nA. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration\nB. Decreased macrophage activity\nC. Increased basophil count\nD. Increased lymphocyte count\n"

Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration\n\nThis hypothesis suggests that stress, particularly during examinations, can affect the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration is a common laboratory finding in individuals under stress, which could indicate a suppressed immune response. Therefore, this finding is most likely to support the hypothesis that stress affects the immune system and makes students more susceptible to infection during examination week."
