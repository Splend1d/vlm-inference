Since \\( f \\) is defined on the interval \\((0, 1)\\), it is clear that \\( f \\) is one-to-one because it maps each element in \\((0, 1)\\) to a unique element in \\((0, 1]\\). However, it is not onto because there are elements in \\((0, 1]\\) that are not mapped to by any element in \\((0, 1)\\). Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nII. The image of \\( f \\) is compact.\n- The image of a function \\( f \\) is the set of all images of the domain under \\( f \\). For a function to be compact, it must be closed and bounded. Since \\( f \\) is defined on \\((0, 1)\\), its image is a closed interval. However, it is not bounded because it can extend infinitely in both directions. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\nIII. \\( f \\) is continuous, one-to-one, and onto.\n- A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. Since \\( f \\) is defined on \\((0, 1)\\), it is continuous at every point in \\((0, 1)\\). It is also one-to-one because it maps each element in \\((0, 1)\\) to a unique element in \\((0, 1]\\). However, it is not onto because there are elements in \\((0, 1]\\) that are not mapped to by any element in \\((0, 1)\\). Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only"
