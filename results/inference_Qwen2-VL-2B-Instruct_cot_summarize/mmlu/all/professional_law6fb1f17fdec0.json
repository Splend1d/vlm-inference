The door opened at 6 a.m. and hundreds of people rushed the entrance for a chance at a hugely discounted holiday gift. When defendant saw that there was a signed copy of a book written by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it, only to be blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She was using the bat as a blocking tool, but he was determined to get the book, so he deliberately stuck his leg out in front of her and tripped her. She fell hard and in the process ended up with a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart over a period of weeks, and ultimately caused her death. What crime can the defendant likely be convicted of?\n\nA. First degree murder\nB. Second degree murder\nC. Involuntary manslaughter\nD. voluntary manslaughter\n"

Voluntary manslaughter occurs when a person intentionally causes the death of another person, but the death is not intentional or premeditated. In this case, the defendant intentionally tripped the little old lady, causing her to fall and suffer a blood clot in her leg, which ultimately led to her death. This is a form of voluntary manslaughter. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
