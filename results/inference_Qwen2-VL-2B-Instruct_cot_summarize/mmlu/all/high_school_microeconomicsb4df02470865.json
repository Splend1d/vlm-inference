The labor-leisure trade-off favors the income effect or more leisure at higher wage rates.\n\nThe backward bending supply curve is a characteristic of a labor market where the quantity of labor supplied increases as the wage rate increases, but the increase in the quantity of labor supplied is less than the increase in the wage rate. This means that the substitution effect (the tendency for workers to substitute more leisure for more work) is greater than the income effect (the tendency for workers to substitute more income for more work). As a result, the quantity of labor supplied continues to rise at every wage rate increase, but the increase in the quantity of labor supplied is less than the increase in the wage rate."
