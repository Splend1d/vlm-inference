It is a graphical representation that shows the cumulative percentage of income earned by different income groups, with the cumulative percentage of income earned by the lowest 10% of income earners being zero. The curve is typically plotted on a graph with the x-axis representing the cumulative percentage of income earned by the lowest 10% of income earners and the y-axis representing the cumulative percentage of income earned by the highest 10% of income earners. The curve is typically used to compare the income distribution of different countries and to identify areas where income inequality is high or low."
