                    "text": "The correct answer is B. H+ would increase inside the intermembrane space (the compartment between inner and outer membranes). \n\nOligomycin binds to ATP synthase, which is responsible for generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). When ATP synthase is inhibited by oligomycin, the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is disrupted, leading to a decrease in the concentration of protons (H+) inside the mitochondrial matrix. This decrease in H+ concentration results in a net influx of H+ into the matrix, which is the first expected response after the application of oligomycin to cells."
