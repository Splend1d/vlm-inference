He finally saw a public defender who filed a motion to dismiss alleging an unconstitutional detention in violation of due process. The prosecution countered that the state's rules allowed for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days, and that the procedure was constitutional. Will the court most likely decide that this detention is unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination.\nB. No, because each case must be decided on its own facts and there may be many good reasons why the state has not yet provided a probable cause determination.\nC. Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\nD. No, because it is constitutional to hold someone for up to 15 days without a probable cause determination.\n"

The prosecution's argument that the detention was constitutional because it was up to 30 days and not due to the lack of a probable cause determination is not persuasive. The state's rules allow for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days, but this does not mean that the detention is constitutional. The detention was prolonged beyond the constitutional limits, and the man's motion to dismiss is a valid challenge to the constitutionality of the detention.\n\nTherefore, the court is most likely to decide that the detention is unconstitutional.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination."
