While McDonaldization involves rationalization of decision-making and the formalization of division of labor, it does not necessarily involve an intense effort on achieving sameness across diverse markets. The other options (rationalization of decisions, bureaucratic organization, dissolution of hierarchical modes of authority) are aspects of McDonaldization."
