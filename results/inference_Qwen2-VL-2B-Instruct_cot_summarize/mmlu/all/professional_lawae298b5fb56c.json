Both the pedestrian and the driver suffered injuries. The pedestrian filed a negligence action against the driver in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in damages. The driver believes that the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally and is therefore responsible for the accident. The driver seeks an attorney's advice on how best to respond to the action. Assume that State B is a contributory negligence state. How should the attorney advise the driver to respond?\n\nA. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\nB. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and defense of contributory negligence and move for judgment on the pleadings.\nC.

File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\n\nIn a contributory negligence state, the driver can assert a defense of contributory negligence, which means that the driver is not liable for the accident if the pedestrian was also at fault for his own actions. The driver can also assert a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for their own injuries. This approach allows the driver to argue that the pedestrian's actions contributed to the accident and that the driver was not solely responsible for the incident."
