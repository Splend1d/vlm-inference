The population of country X is exactly the same as country Y.\n2. Country X produces twice as much output as country Y.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n- Population of Country X = Population of Country Y\n- Output of Country X = 2 * Output of Country Y\n\nFrom the information given, we can infer that:\n\n- The populations of Country X and Country Y are equal.\n- The output of Country X is twice that of Country Y.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The people of country X are smarter than the people of country Y.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The population and output are not directly related to intelligence.\n\nB. The people of country X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country Y.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The output of Country X is twice that of Country Y, but this does not necessarily mean that Country X has a higher standard of living. The standard of living is influenced by many factors, including income, living conditions, and access to resources.\n\nC. The people of country Y enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country X.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The output of Country X is twice that of Country Y, but this does not necessarily mean that Country Y has a higher standard of living. The standard of living is influenced by many factors, including income, living conditions, and access to resources.\n\nD. The people of country Y work twice as hard as the people of country X.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The output of Country X is twice that of Country Y, but this does not necessarily mean that Country Y works twice as hard. The amount of work required to produce the same output can vary significantly depending on the resources and technology available.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The people of country X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country Y."
