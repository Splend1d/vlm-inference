This is because the body's circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep and wake cycles, is disrupted by the lack of sleep. As a result, the body may experience a range of symptoms, including fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms can lead to a decrease in coordination and overall performance."
