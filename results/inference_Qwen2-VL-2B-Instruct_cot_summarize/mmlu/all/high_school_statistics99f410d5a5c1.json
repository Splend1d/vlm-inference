The margin of error is the range within which the true population parameter is expected to fall, given a certain level of confidence. In this context, the 95% confidence level means that if we were to conduct many polls and calculate the confidence interval for each, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population proportion.\n\nGiven that the margin of error is \u00b13.2%, we can interpret it as follows:\n\n- The margin of error of \u00b13.2% means that the true proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing is expected to fall within the range of 43% \u00b1 3.2%.\n- This means that there is a 95% chance that the true proportion falls within this range.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is:\n\nD. About 95% of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2 percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing.\n\nThis option correctly reflects the meaning of the margin of error in the context of the poll results."
