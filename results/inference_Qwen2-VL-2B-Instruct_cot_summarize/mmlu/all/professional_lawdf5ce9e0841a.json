One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving. If Loretta then sued Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for\n\nA. Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.\nB. Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\nC. Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.\nD. Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.\n"

Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Loretta's Lease**: Loretta signed a two-year lease agreement with Sally for $1,000 per month. This lease was executed before the new law was passed, which prohibited topless strip joints in the area.\n\n2. **Sally's Use**: Sally rented the space to perform a topless strip joint, which was illegal under the new law. This illegal use of the space made it impossible for Loretta to perform her intended use of the space.\n\n3. **Lease Discharge**: Under the doctrine of impossibility of performance, if the party to the lease cannot perform their obligations due to an impossibility of the performance, the lease is discharged. This means that Loretta cannot enforce her rights under the lease because the performance of the lease contract is impossible due to the new law.\n\nTherefore, the likely outcome is that Loretta would be discharged from the lease contract, and Sally would be entitled to the full amount of the lease, which is $1,000 per month for two years."
