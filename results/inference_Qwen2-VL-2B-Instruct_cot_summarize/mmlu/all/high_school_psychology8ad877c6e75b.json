Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.\n\nA researcher might use a variable ratio of reinforcement rather than a fixed ratio to avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle. Generalization refers to the ability of a behavior to be performed in new situations, while the Premack principle refers to the tendency of animals to avoid situations that are similar to the one in which they were previously punished. By using a variable ratio schedule, the researcher can ensure that the animal is not exposed to situations that are similar to the one in which it was previously punished, which can help to prevent these problems."
