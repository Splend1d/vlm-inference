To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt. Although the graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl, she was in a festive mood and drank it, anyway. A few minutes later, the graduate became very dizzy and attempted to stand up from the barstool. As she tried to walk to the restroom, she became nauseated and vomited over a customer sitting at a nearby table. The customer was embarrassed and greatly humiliated by the incident. If the customer asserts a claim against the graduate, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nB. prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.\nC. not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.\nD. not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking.\n"

                    "text": "The graduate's actions in this scenario can be analyzed in the context of the law of intoxication and the concept of \"voluntary intoxication.\"\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The graduate, a law student, had passed the bar exam and was celebrating with friends. She ordered a round of Hula Girls, a potent alcoholic drink, which is typically consumed in a glass with an inverted lemon peel. The drink is intended to be consumed in a festive and social setting, but the graduate's actions led to a serious and embarrassing situation.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A: prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.**\n     - This option suggests that the graduate's actions were so extreme and outrageous that they would be considered beyond the bounds of ordinary behavior. However, the graduate's actions were not extreme or outrageous in the context of the drink's intended use. The drink is typically consumed in a festive setting, and the graduate's actions were not unusual for someone in a festive mood.\n   - **Option B: prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.**\n     - This option suggests that the graduate's actions were offensive and caused the customer to become embarrassed and humiliated. However, the graduate's actions were not offensive in the context of the drink's intended use. The drink is intended to be consumed in a festive setting, and the graduate's actions were not unusual for someone in a festive mood.\n   - **Option C: not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.**\n     - This option suggests that the graduate's actions were involuntary because she was under the influence of the drink. However, the graduate was not under the influence of the drink in the context of the drink's intended use. The drink is intended to be consumed in a festive setting, and the graduate's actions were not unusual for someone in a festive mood.\n   - **Option D: not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking.**\n     - This option suggests that the graduate was unaware of the drink's contents and therefore did not intend to consume it. However, the graduate was aware of the drink's contents and intended to consume it in a festive setting. The graduate's actions were not unusual for someone in a festive mood.\n\nGiven the context and the intended use of the drink, the graduate's actions were not voluntary and were not beyond the bounds of ordinary behavior. Therefore, the graduate's actions were not involuntary, and the customer's claim would most likely prevail.\n\n**Final Answer: C. not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.**"
