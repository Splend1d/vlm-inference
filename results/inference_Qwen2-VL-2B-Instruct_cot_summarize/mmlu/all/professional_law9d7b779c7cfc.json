The mortgage was promptly recorded. The next year, the father died intestate. The father's heirs were the son and his two sisters. The sisters first learned of the mortgage just after their father died. The sisters now assert that the son, their brother, holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself because as a tenant in common with his sisters, he has a fiduciary duty toward them. There are no applicable statutes. Are the sisters correct?\n\nA. No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\nB. No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\nD. Yes, because their three interests are equal.\n"

                    "text": "The issue here revolves around the nature of the mortgage and the relationship between the son and his sisters as tenants in common. Let's break down the relevant points:\n\n1. **Nature of the Mortgage**: The mortgage was granted by the father to the son. This means that the mortgage was a loan made by the father to the son, and the son is the borrower.\n\n2. **Creation of Tenancy in Common**: Tenancy in common is a legal relationship where three or more persons own property together as tenants in common. This means that each tenant has an equal interest in the property, and each has the right to use, sell, or dispose of the property as they see fit.\n\n3. **Rights and Duties of Tenants in Common**: Tenants in common have certain rights and duties. For example, they must maintain the property in good condition, pay taxes, and make repairs. They also have the right to sell the property, but they must do so in a manner that is fair to the other tenants.\n\n4. **Fiduciary Duty**: A fiduciary relationship exists when one person has a duty to act in the best interests of another person, even if the relationship is not formally established as a trust or partnership. In the context of tenants in common, the son has a fiduciary duty to the sisters because he is acting as a tenant in common with them.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\n\nThe son has a fiduciary duty to the sisters as tenants in common, which means that he has a duty to act in their best interests, even if the relationship is not formally established as a trust or partnership."
