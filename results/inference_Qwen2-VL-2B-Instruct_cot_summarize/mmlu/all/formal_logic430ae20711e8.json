There are those who use predicate variables.\n  - This is the first premise.\n2. The values of these variables are attributes.\n  - This is the second premise.\n3. Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\n  - This is the third premise.\n4. The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\n  - This is the fourth premise.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is what the argument is trying to support or assert. Let's analyze each premise to see what it supports:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: \"There are those who use predicate variables.\"\n   - This premise introduces the idea that predicate variables are used.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: \"The values of these variables are attributes.\"\n   - This premise introduces the idea that the values of predicate variables are attributes.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: \"Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\"\n   - This premise introduces the idea that predicates are used regardless of whether attributes are present.\n\n4. **Premise 4**: \"The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\"\n   - This premise introduces the idea that the dummy predicate 'F' is used for expository purposes.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n- The conclusion is not directly stated in the premises. Instead, it is implied by the premises that predicate variables are used, and that predicates are used regardless of attributes.\n- The conclusion is not explicitly stated in the premises, but it is implied that the use of predicate variables and predicates is necessary for the argument to hold.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conclusion of the argument is not explicitly stated in the premises. However, it can be inferred that the argument is about the necessity of predicate variables and predicates for the purpose of clarity and expository purposes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates."
