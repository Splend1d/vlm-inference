Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.\n\nPapadaki's argument is that Kant's view of sexual objectification is flawed because it fails to recognize the intrinsic value and dignity of human beings. According to Papadaki, Kant's view does not account for the fact that sexual use can be a means to enhance and fulfill human potential, rather than simply dehumanizing or objectifying humans."
