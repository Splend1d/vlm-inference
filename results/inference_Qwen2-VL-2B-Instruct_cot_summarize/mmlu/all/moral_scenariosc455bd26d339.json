Shooting a rat with a gun is generally considered morally wrong, as it is a violent act that can cause harm to the animal and potentially harm the character themselves. In Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did not do anything clearly morally wrong. Wearing a short skirt and tank top to a funeral is generally considered acceptable and respectful behavior, as it is a private and personal event."
