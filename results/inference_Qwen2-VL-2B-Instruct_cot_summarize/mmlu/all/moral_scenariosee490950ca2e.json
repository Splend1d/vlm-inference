This is because it is generally considered improper to dispose of food waste in the trash, as it can lead to food waste and other environmental issues. In scenario 2, the main character did something morally wrong when they purchased the diamonds, but it was not done with the intention of selling them. The purchase was done for personal use, and the diamonds were not sold. Therefore, the main character did not do something clearly morally wrong in either scenario."
