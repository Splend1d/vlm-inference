The outer ear, also known as the pinna, is the first part of the auditory system and is responsible for collecting and focusing sounds from the air. It is not responsible for transducing sound waves or conducting sound. The middle ear, which is located behind the eardrum, is responsible for converting the sound waves into mechanical vibrations that can be transmitted to the inner ear. The inner ear, which is located behind the eardrum, is responsible for converting the mechanical vibrations into electrical signals that can be transmitted to the brain."
