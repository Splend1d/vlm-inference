And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nUpon the return of Cort\u00e9s's expedition, which of the following was a consequence of the actions described in the memoir?\n\nA.

An increased rate of inflation\n\nThe passage describes the actions taken by Cort\u00e9s and his expedition, which included the division of gold among the soldiers and the imposition of a levy on those who refused to pay. This action led to a situation where many of the soldiers refused to comply with the demands, resulting in a situation where Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of gold under the pretense of a loan. This led to an increased rate of inflation, as the gold was taken from the soldiers and used to pay off the debt."
