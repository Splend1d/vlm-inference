Since the capacitor loses half its charge every second, after \\(n\\) seconds, the charge \\(Q\\) is \\(Q_0 \\cdot 2^{-n}\\), where \\(Q_0\\) is the initial charge.\n\nGiven that after 5 seconds, the charge is \\(q\\), we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[q = Q_0 \\cdot 2^{-5}\\]\n\nSince \\(2^{-5} = \\frac{1}{32}\\), we can solve for \\(Q_0\\):\n\n\\[q = Q_0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{32}\\]\n\n\\[Q_0 = q \\cdot 32\\]\n\nTherefore, the initial charge \\(Q_0\\) was \\(32q\\)."
