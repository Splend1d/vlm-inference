It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.\n\nShort-acting bronchodilators (SABs) are used to relieve symptoms of bronchitis and asthma by relaxing the muscles in the airways, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve airflow. They are typically taken first because they work quickly to dilate the airways, allowing better deposition of other medications that may be used to manage the underlying condition."
