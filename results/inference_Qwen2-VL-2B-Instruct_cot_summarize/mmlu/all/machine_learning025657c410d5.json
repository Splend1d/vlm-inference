The EM algorithm is a method for finding maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models, and it does not guarantee that the log-likelihood will increase with each iteration.\n\nStatement 2 is false. One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment. However, Q-learning can also be used when the learner has no prior knowledge, as long as it can estimate the value of the next state based on the current state and the actions taken so far."
