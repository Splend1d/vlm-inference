On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:\"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. \"The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed \"$75,000,\" instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?\n\nA. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\nB. The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\nC. The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.\nD. The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n"

The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The collector initially stated the price of the stamp collection as $75,000.\n2. The secretary typed the price as $75,000 instead of $78,000.\n3. The cousin received the letter with the incorrect price.\n4. The cousin accepted the offer, but the price was not corrected before the acceptance.\n\nThe mistake in the price was a basic assumption of fact, which means it was a fundamental error that affected the entire transaction. The collector and the cousin both made mistakes, and the price term was not corrected before the cousin accepted the offer. Therefore, the contract is enforceable, but either party can rescind it because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact."
