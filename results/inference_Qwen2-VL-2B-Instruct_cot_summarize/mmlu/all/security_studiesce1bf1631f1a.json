Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Armed force should only ever be used in the national interest and that humanitarian intervention is therefore imprudent.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the realist case against humanitarian interventions. Option B is about the impact of foreign intervention on the proportion of wars ending in outright victory and the likelihood of a stable peace, which is not a core argument of the realist case. Option C is about the impact of foreign intervention on prolonging wars, which is also not a core argument of the realist case. Option D is about the prioritization of the human over the state, which is a core argument of the realist case."
