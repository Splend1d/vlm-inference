The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of the ten years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance. 2.

                    "text": " For the first option, we can use the formula for compound interest to find the amount Alex owes after 5 years. The formula is $A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the amount owed, $P$ is the principal (initial amount), $r$ is the annual interest rate, $n$ is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and $t$ is the number of years. In this case, $P = 10000$, $r = 0.10$, $n = 4$, and $t = 5$. So we have $A = 10000(1 + 0.10/4)^{4*5} = 10000(1.025)^{20} \\approx 16400.5$. Alex then makes a payment equal to half of what he owes, so he pays off $10000 \\times 0.5 = 5000$. The remaining balance is $16400.5 - 5000 = 11400.5$. This is the amount Alex owes at the end of 10 years. The interest on this remaining balance for the remaining 5 years is $11400.5 \\times 0.10 \\times 5 = 570$. So the total amount Alex has to pay back under the first option is $10000 + 570 = 10570$.\n\nFor the second option, the interest rate is $12\\%$ per year, or $0.12$ per year. The amount Alex owes after 10 years is $10000(1 + 0.12)^{10} = 10000(1.12)^{10} \\approx 16400.5$. Alex then makes a lump-sum payment at the end of 10 years, so the amount he owes at the end of 10 years is $16400.5 - 10000 = 6400.5$. The interest on this remaining balance for the remaining 5 years is $6400.5 \\times 0.12 \\times 5 = 384$. So the total amount Alex has to pay back under the second option is $10000 + 384 = 10384$.\n\nThe positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes is $10570 - 10384 = 185$. Rounding to the nearest dollar, the answer is $\\boxed{184}$."
