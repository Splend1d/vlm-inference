The study violates ethical guidelines.\n\nPsychologists and researchers are bound by ethical guidelines to ensure that their experiments are conducted in a manner that respects the rights and welfare of participants. Ethical guidelines typically include ensuring that participants are informed about the purpose of the study, their rights, and the potential risks and benefits. If a study involves conditioning a baby to fear small animals, it is likely that the ethical guidelines would prohibit such an experiment due to the potential harm to the baby and the ethical implications of manipulating their fear response.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
