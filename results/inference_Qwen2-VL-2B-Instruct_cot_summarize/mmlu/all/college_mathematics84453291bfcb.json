                    "text": "To determine which of the statements are true, we need to analyze the given determinant equation det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3.\n\n1. **Trace of A**: The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. For a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix A, the trace is given by tr(A) = a1 + a2 + a3. Since A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, the trace of A is tr(A) = a1 + a2 + a3. The given determinant equation is det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3. This equation does not directly give us the trace of A. However, we can use the fact that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. If we assume that A has eigenvalues \u03bb1, \u03bb2, and \u03bb3, then det(A) = \u03bb1*\u03bb2*\u03bb3. Since the determinant of A is given by det(A) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, we can equate the two expressions for det(A) to find the eigenvalues. However, this approach is not necessary for determining the trace of A.\n\n2. **Determinate of A**: The determinant of a matrix is a scalar value that can be computed from the matrix. For a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix A, the determinant is given by det(A) = a1*a2*a3 + a2*a3*a1 + a3*a1*a2 - a1*a2*a3 - a2*a3*a1 - a3*a1*a2. The given determinant equation is det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3. This equation does not directly give us the determinant of A. However, we can use the fact that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. If we assume that A has eigenvalues \u03bb1, \u03bb2, and \u03bb3, then det(A) = \u03bb1*\u03bb2*\u03bb3. Since the determinant of A is given by det(A) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, we can equate the two expressions for det(A) to find the eigenvalues. However, this approach is not necessary for determining the determinant of A.\n\n3. **Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues of A are the roots of the characteristic polynomial det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = 0. The characteristic polynomial is given by det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb + 3. The given determinant equation is det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3. This equation does not directly give us the eigenvalues. However, we can use the fact that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. If we assume that A has eigenvalues \u03bb1, \u03bb2, and \u03bb3, then det(A) = \u03bb1*\u03bb2*\u03bb3. Since the determinant of A is given by det(A) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, we can equate the two expressions for det(A) to find the eigenvalues. However, this approach is not necessary for determining the eigenvalues.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the lack of direct information about the eigenvalues, we cannot definitively determine the truth of the statements without additional information. However, based on the given determinant equation, we can infer that the determinant of A is not necessarily equal to \u22123, and the trace of A is not necessarily equal to 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only"
