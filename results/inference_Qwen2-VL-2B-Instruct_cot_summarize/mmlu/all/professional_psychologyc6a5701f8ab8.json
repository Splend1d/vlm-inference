Explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable.\n\nResearch on memory indicates that both explicit and implicit memory capacities decline with age, but the rate of decline varies. Explicit memory, which involves conscious recall and recognition, shows a more gradual decline. Implicit memory, which involves automatic processing and memory without conscious awareness, remains relatively stable over time."
