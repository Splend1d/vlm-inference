If the action is a physical or actual appropriation\n- This is a consideration because a physical appropriation involves the government physically taking over the property, which is a taking. If the government appropriates the land without compensation, it is a taking.\n\nB. If the action denies all economic use of the land\n- This is a consideration because a taking occurs when the government denies the property owner the right to use the land for any economic purpose. If the government takes the land without allowing the property owner to use it for economic purposes, it is a taking.\n\nC. If the action just decreases the value of property\n- This is not a consideration because the value of property is not a factor in determining whether an action constitutes a taking. The value of property is not a legal consideration in determining whether an action is a taking.\n\nD. If the action affects the property taxes\n- This is a consideration because property taxes are a form of compensation for taking property. If the government takes property without compensating the property owner, the property owner may lose the right to property taxes, which is a taking.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
