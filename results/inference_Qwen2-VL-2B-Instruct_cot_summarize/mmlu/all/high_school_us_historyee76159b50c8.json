We apprehend it, therefore, to be hard usage, and will doubtless (if continued) reduce us to a state of beggary, whereby we shall become a burthen to others, if not timely prevented by the interposition of your justice and your power.\n\"Your petitioners further show, that we apprehend ourselves to be aggrieved, in that, while we are not allowed the privilege of freemen of the State, having no vote or influence in the election of those that tax us, yet many of our colour (as is well known) have cheerfully entered the field of battle in the defence of the common cause, and that (as we conceive) against a similar exertion of power (in regard to taxation), too well known to need a recital in this place.\"\n\u2014Paul Cuffe's Petition, Massachusetts, 1780\nThe petition by Paul Cuffe, above, best illustrates which of the following developments?\n\nA. The rhetoric of the American Revolution raised awareness of social inequalities and inspired groups and individuals to call for greater political democracy.\nB. Slave rebellions, such as the Stono Rebellion, inspired enslaved Americans throughout North America to engage in similar behavior.\nC. African Americans who had fought alongside the British during the American Revolution felt doubly vulnerable\u2014as African Americans and as traitors to the patriot cause\u2014after the British defeat.\nD. African Americans received worse treatment under the state government of Massachusetts than they had under British law during the colonial period.\n"

                    "text": "The question refers to the information provided in the given text about Paul Cuffe's petition, which was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court in 1780. The text discusses the grievances of African Americans, particularly those who were poor and enslaved, who were being taxed by the state despite not having the right to vote or influence the election of tax collectors. The petitioners argue that their treatment is unjust and that it will lead to them becoming \"burdens\" to others if not prevented by the state's intervention.\n\nGiven this context, the best illustration of the development that the petition by Paul Cuffe best illustrates is:\n\nA. The rhetoric of the American Revolution raised awareness of social inequalities and inspired groups and individuals to call for greater political democracy.\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that the petition by Paul Cuffe was part of a broader movement to address social inequalities and advocate for greater political democracy, which was a significant development in the American Revolution."
