Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

The passage mentions a copper mine in ZKRY, which is a town in the Sudan, and the copper is brought to BYTY (possibly a city in the Sudan or another region).\n2. The copper is sold for two-thirds of its weight in gold, indicating that it is a valuable commodity.\n3. The copper is extracted from deposits by digging pits about a man's height in depth.\n4. The passage mentions pagan nations in the kingdom from whom gold is extracted, implying trade and possibly the presence of trade routes.\n\nGiven these points, the most supported statement about the period 600\u20131450 C.E. is:\n\nB. International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nThis statement aligns with the information provided about the copper mine and the trade in gold, indicating ongoing trade and possibly the development of international trade connections during this period."
