The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy\n\nWorld War I (1914-1918) was a significant turning point in the global economy, shifting economic power from Europe to the United States. The war led to a significant increase in European military spending, which led to a decline in the European population levels. This, in turn, led to a decrease in the demand for European goods and services, particularly those that were dependent on European labor and resources. As a result, European countries were forced to sell their goods and services to the United States, which helped to boost the US economy. The United States also became a creditor country, with European countries paying for their war expenses. This led to a significant increase in the US economy and helped to shift economic power from Europe to the United States."
