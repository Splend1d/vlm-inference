This principle states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that Joe eats the same kind of fruit on all three meals. There are 3 possible ways for Joe to eat the same kind of fruit on all three meals: eating an apple on all three meals, eating an orange on all three meals, or eating a banana on all three meals.\n\nThe probability of Joe eating the same kind of fruit on all three meals is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{same kind of fruit on all three meals}) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\]\n\nSince the probability of Joe eating the same kind of fruit on all three meals is 1, the probability of Joe not eating the same kind of fruit on all three meals is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{different kind of fruit on all three meals}) = 1 - P(\\text{same kind of fruit on all three meals}) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we can use the complementary probability formula to find the probability that Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{at least two different kinds of fruit}) = 1 - P(\\text{same kind of fruit on all three meals}) = 1 - 0 = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit is 1, which corresponds to option D."
