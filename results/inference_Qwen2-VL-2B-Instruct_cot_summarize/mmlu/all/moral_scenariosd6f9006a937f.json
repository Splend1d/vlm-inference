This is considered morally wrong because it involves intentionally contaminating the phone with urine, which is generally considered unsanitary and potentially harmful to the phone's functionality.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did not do anything clearly morally wrong. The character loaned their stepsister the fur coat they inherited, but they knew PETA was going to be at the same ball, so they did not use the fur coat for the purpose of avoiding PETA's presence. This action was not intended to harm anyone or violate any moral standards."
