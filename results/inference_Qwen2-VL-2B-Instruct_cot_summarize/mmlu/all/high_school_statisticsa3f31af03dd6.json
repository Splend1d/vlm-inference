The formula is:\n\n\\[ R^2 = \\frac{\\text{Variance of y around its mean}}{\\text{Variance of x around its mean}} \\]\n\nGiven that the correlation coefficient (R) is 0.6, we can calculate the coefficient of determination (R^2) as follows:\n\n\\[ R^2 = \\frac{0.6}{1} = 0.6 \\]\n\nThis means that 60% of the variation in y is explained by the variation in x. To find how many times this percentage is, we need to divide 60% by 30% (since 0.6 is the same as 0.6), which gives us:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{30} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of variation in y that is explained by the variation in x is 2 times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3. The correct answer is:\n\nA. 2"
