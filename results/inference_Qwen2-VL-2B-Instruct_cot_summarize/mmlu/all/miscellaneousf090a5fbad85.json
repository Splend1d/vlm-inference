Ten miles long and nearly 500 feet deep (152.4 m meters), Lake McDonald, the largest lake in the park, is a direct result of glacial carving. High peaks surrounding the lake all show evidence of the power of glaciers to carve even the hardest of rock. The powerful glaciers that carved the broad U-shaped valley that Lake McDonald sits in also carved smaller hanging valleys with wonderful waterfalls that are accessible by numerous hiking trails. Which of the following best identifies the intended audience of the passage?\n\nA. Scientists researching glacier development\nB. Teachers interested in creating virtual park field trips\nC. Academics studying the historical context of national parks\nD. Families interested in visiting Lake McDonald\n"

The passage discusses the formation of Lake McDonald, which is the largest lake in the park. It mentions glacial carving and the presence of high peaks surrounding the lake, indicating a focus on natural geology and the impact of glaciers on the landscape.\n\n2. The passage also mentions hiking trails that lead to waterfalls, suggesting that the lake is accessible to visitors and that the passage is aimed at informing them about the natural beauty and accessibility of the lake.\n\n3. The passage does not seem to be focused on scientific research, historical context, or family visits. It is more likely to be aimed at informing visitors about the natural features of the park.\n\nGiven these points, the passage is most likely intended for:\n\nD. Families interested in visiting Lake McDonald\n\nThis option aligns with the information provided about the lake's accessibility and the purpose of the passage, which is to inform visitors about the natural features of the park."
