Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following specific developments contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15?\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n"

Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\n\nThis development was significant because it directly challenged the idea that the United States had the right to own and control territories like Florida, which had been a Spanish possession. The sentiment expressed in Federalist #15 was that the United States had the right to own and control territories, and that the idea of the \"niggers\" belonging to the whites was a violation of that right. The retaking of Florida by the Spanish was a direct challenge to this idea, and it reinforced the sentiment that the United States had the right to own and control territories."
