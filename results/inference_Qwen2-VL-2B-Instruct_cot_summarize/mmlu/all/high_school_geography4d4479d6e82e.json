Canada's first major migration came from France.\n\nHistorical migration streams in North America have been influenced by various factors, including political, economic, and cultural reasons. The first major migration to Canada came from Europe, specifically from France, which was a significant source of immigrants during the 19th century. This migration wave was part of the larger European migration to North America, which included other countries such as Britain, Germany, and Scandinavia.\n\nThe other migration streams mentioned (British Isles, Latin America, and Europe) are correct, as they have been significant sources of migration to Canada and the United States."
