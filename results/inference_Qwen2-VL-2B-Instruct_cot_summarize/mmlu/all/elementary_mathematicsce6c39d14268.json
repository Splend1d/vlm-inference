So, the total number of gallons of milk is:\n\n\\[40 \\text{ gallons (low-fat)} + 15 \\text{ gallons (chocolate)} = 55 \\text{ gallons}\\]\n\nThe ratio of the number of low-fat gallons to chocolate gallons is then:\n\n\\[\\frac{40}{15}\\]\n\nTo simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n\n\\[\\frac{40 \\div 5}{15 \\div 5} = \\frac{8}{3}\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the number of low-fat gallons to chocolate gallons in the Tranquility Inn's weekly milk order is \\(8:3\\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 8:03."
