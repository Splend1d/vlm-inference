It encourages stability of the regime\n\nOil and other natural resource trade can have several effects on developing states, but one of the most significant is that it can encourage stability of the regime. When a country is dependent on oil exports, it may be more likely to maintain a stable government and avoid political instability. This is because the government may be able to use its wealth from oil exports to provide security and stability to the country. However, it is important to note that oil and natural resource trade can also have negative effects on developing states, such as environmental degradation and economic inequality."
