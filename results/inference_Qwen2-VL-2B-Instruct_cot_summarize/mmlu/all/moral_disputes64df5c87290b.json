The patient will suffer less if he or she is allowed to die, compared to how much he or she would suffer if the physician actively ended his or her life.\n\nActive euthanasia involves the physician actively ending the patient's life, while passive euthanasia involves the patient choosing to end their own life. The principle behind active euthanasia is that it is generally considered more humane and less traumatic for the patient to choose to end their own life, as opposed to the physician actively ending the patient's life. Therefore, the patient will suffer less if they are allowed to die compared to the physician actively ending their life."
