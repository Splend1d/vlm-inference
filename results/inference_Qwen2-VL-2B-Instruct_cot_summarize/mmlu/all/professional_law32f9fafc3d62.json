At the time, no one was in the treatment room except the doctor and the child; the mother had left the room to get a cup of coffee. Two weeks later, when the child told her mother what had occurred in the treatment room, the mother suffered severe emotional distress that caused her to become physically ill. In an action against the doctor by the mother on her own behalf to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, is the mother likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mother was contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment.\nB. No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness.\nC. Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\nD. Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. \u0080\u0083\n"

Contributory negligence occurs when a plaintiff's own actions or omissions contribute to their own injury. In this case, the mother's distress was caused by her own actions, which were to leave the child alone with the doctor during treatment.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Nature of the Conduct**: The doctor molested the child while treating her. This is a clear example of intentional conduct, as the doctor's actions were deliberate and malicious.\n\n2. **Nature of the Mother's Distress**: The mother's distress was caused by the doctor's conduct, which was intentional and malicious. This is a clear example of intentional conduct.\n\n3. **Nature of the Mother's Omission**: The mother left the room to get a cup of coffee, which was a reasonable action given the circumstances. However, this action did not prevent the doctor from molesting the child.\n\n4. **Nature of the Mother's Conduct**: The mother's conduct was to leave the child alone with the doctor during treatment. This was a reasonable action given the circumstances, but it did not prevent the doctor from molesting the child.\n\n5. **Nature of the Mother's Omission**: The mother's omission was to leave the child alone with the doctor during treatment. This was a reasonable action given the circumstances, but it did not prevent the doctor from molesting the child.\n\nGiven that the mother's distress was caused by her own actions, which were reasonable but not sufficient to prevent the doctor's conduct, the mother is likely to prevail in her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct.**"
