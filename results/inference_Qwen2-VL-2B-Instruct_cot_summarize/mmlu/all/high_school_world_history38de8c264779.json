                    "text": "To determine which conclusion best supports the comparison between the two verses, let's analyze each option in the context of the given information.\n\n1. **Atheism in the Premodern Era**: The Qur'an's verse 5:89 explicitly states that strong drink and games of chance are infamy of Satan's handiwork. This implies that these practices are considered evil and should be avoided. The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, on the other hand, encourages pouring wine, which is a practice that is often associated with religious celebrations and festivities. This suggests that the verses are not directly comparing the two in terms of atheism.\n\n2. **Religious Restrictions Not Universally Observed**: The Qur'an's verse 5:89 explicitly states that believers should leave strong drink and games of chance aside. This implies that there were religious restrictions in place. The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, on the other hand, encourages pouring wine, which is a practice that is often associated with religious celebrations and festivities. This suggests that the verses are not directly comparing the two in terms of religious restrictions.\n\n3. **Christian Missionaries Steadily Winning Converts Among Muslim Populations**: The Qur'an's verse 5:89 does not provide any information about the impact of Christian missionaries on Muslim populations. The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, on the other hand, does not provide any information about the impact of Christian missionaries on Muslim populations. Therefore, this option does not provide any support for the comparison.\n\n4. **Muslim Intellectuals Were Generally Hostile to Traditional Religious Practice**: The Qur'an's verse 5:89 explicitly states that believers should leave strong drink and games of chance aside. This implies that there were religious restrictions in place. The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, on the other hand, encourages pouring wine, which is a practice that is often associated with religious celebrations and festivities. This suggests that the verses are not directly comparing the two in terms of intellectual hostility.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate conclusion that can be drawn from the comparison of the two verses is:\n\n**B. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.**"
