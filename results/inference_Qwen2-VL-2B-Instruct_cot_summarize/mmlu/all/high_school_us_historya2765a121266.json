Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n\u2014Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nIn her speech, Eleanor Roosevelt alluded to the earlier threat to civil liberties created by which of the following?\n\nA. World War I\nB. The New Deal\nC. The Cold War\nD. The Great Depression\n"

The Great Depression.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt's speech, delivered in 1940, discusses the importance of civil liberties in the context of the ongoing threat of fascism and the need to preserve democracy. She mentions that civil liberties have been threatened in other countries, particularly during times of war, and that in the United States, they are particularly important because of the country's peace and the absence of war-related threats. The Great Depression, which began in 1929, was a significant economic crisis that affected many countries, including the United States, and it was a time of significant political and social upheaval. Therefore, the threat to civil liberties during the Great Depression was a relevant and ongoing concern for Eleanor Roosevelt."
