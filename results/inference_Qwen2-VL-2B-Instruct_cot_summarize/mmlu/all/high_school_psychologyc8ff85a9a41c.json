In Group I, each rat was raised in isolation with no toys, while in Group II, rats were divided into small groups and given toys to play with. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the probable findings of this study?\n\nA. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh more than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nB. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nC. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\nD. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will consist of more white matter, while the brains of the rats raised in Group II will consist of more gray matter.\n"

The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\n\nThis statement reflects the probable findings of the study, as it suggests that the differences in brain development between the two groups are not significant enough to be detected by the methods used in the study. The study did not measure the weight of the brains or the types of matter within them, so it cannot provide definitive conclusions about the weight or composition of the brains."
