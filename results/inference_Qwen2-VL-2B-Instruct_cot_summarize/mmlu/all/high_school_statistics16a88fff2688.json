                    "text": "To determine the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of the length of life of the electronic parts, we can use the information provided about the distribution of the parts.\n\nGiven:\n- 60% of the parts last over 3 years.\n- 70% of the parts last less than 6 years.\n\nLet's denote the mean (\u03bc) as the average length of life of the parts and the standard deviation (\u03c3) as the spread of the distribution.\n\nFirst, let's find the percentage of parts that last between 3 and 6 years. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n- 60% of the parts last over 3 years.\n- 70% of the parts last less than 6 years.\n\nSo, the percentage of parts that last between 3 and 6 years is:\n\\[ 60\\% + 70\\% = 130\\% \\]\n\nThis means that 130% of the parts last between 3 and 6 years. Therefore, the remaining 70% of the parts last less than 3 years or more than 6 years.\n\nSince the distribution is normal, we can assume that the distribution is symmetric around the mean. This means that the mean (\u03bc) is the midpoint of the distribution, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is the square root of the variance.\n\nThe variance (\u03c3\u00b2) can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Variance} = \\frac{(60\\% \\times 3\\text{ years})^2 + (70\\% \\times 6\\text{ years})^2}{100\\%} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Variance} = \\frac{(180\\% \\times 9\\text{ years})^2 + (420\\% \\times 36\\text{ years})^2}{100\\%} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Variance} = \\frac{(1620\\% \\times 81\\text{ years})^2 + (14760\\% \\times 1296\\text{ years})^2}{100\\%} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Variance} = \\frac{(134081\\text{ years})^2 + (190504\\text{ years})^2}{100\\%} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Variance} = \\frac{174604001\\text{ years}^2}{100\\%} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Variance} = 174604001 \\text{ years}^2 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) using the formula:\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{\\text{Mean}}{\\text{Variance}} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{Variance}}{\\text{Variance}}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{174604001}{174604001} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 0.1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{174604001}{174604001}} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{1} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the mean (\u03bc) is 0.1 years, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 1 year. The correct answer is:\nD. \u03bc = 4.377, \u03c3 = 3.261"
