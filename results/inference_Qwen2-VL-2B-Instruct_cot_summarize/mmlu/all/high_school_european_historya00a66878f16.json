The passage discusses the belief that unless working-class aspirations were met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia.\n2. By 1920, this fear had receded, and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant.\n3. The Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, which was approved in September 1920, was deferred by the Government's Housing Board due to the Council's commitments and the limited funds available.\n4. The Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme in May 1921, cutting the housing target by half.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that the attitude prevalent after the First World War that is evident in the passage is:\n\nC. Increased disillusionment and cynicism\n\nThis is because the passage describes a shift in perception from the belief that working-class aspirations would lead to revolution to the realization that these aspirations were not being met, leading to a decrease in fear and a shift towards a more pragmatic and realistic approach to housing policies."
