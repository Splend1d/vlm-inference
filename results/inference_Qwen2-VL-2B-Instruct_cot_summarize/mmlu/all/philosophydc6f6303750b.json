This question challenges the idea that knowledge is innate or remembered as a result of being triggered by experience, as it suggests that recognizing the correct answer requires prior knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. how anyone can recognize the correct answer to a question without already knowing the answer."
