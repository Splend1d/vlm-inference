A randomized block design, blocked on temperature, with six treatment groups\n\nThis design is appropriate because it allows for the independent variable (temperature) to be treated as a blocking factor, which means that the effect of temperature on the texture of the cakes can be isolated from the effect of the other variables (pan and oven type)."
