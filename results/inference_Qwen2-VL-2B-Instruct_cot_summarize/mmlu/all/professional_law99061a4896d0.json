The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?\n\nA. Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.\nB. No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.\nC. No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.\nD. Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.\n"

This is because the declaratory judgment action is a type of federal lawsuit that seeks to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute or regulation. The court will consider the merits of the plaintiff's claim and determine whether the statute or regulation is constitutional.\n\nGiven that the law student has filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court, the federal district court will likely dismiss the declaratory relief action if the court determines that the plaintiff's fears of a future arrest are speculative or not grounded in a real threat of enforcement. This is because the declaratory relief action is a type of federal lawsuit that seeks to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute or regulation, and the court will consider the merits of the plaintiff's claim and determine whether the statute or regulation is constitutional.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute."
