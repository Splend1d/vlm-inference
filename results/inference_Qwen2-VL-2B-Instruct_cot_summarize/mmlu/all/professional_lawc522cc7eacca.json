The woman's sister owns parcel \"C,\" which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel \"B\" lies between Parcels \"A\" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system. This was because of an especially pliable soil condition of which the woman was unaware prior to construction of the drainage system. In an action brought by the sister against the woman to recover property damage for the subsidence of her land, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.\nB. The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\nC. The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.\nD. The woman, unless she sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.\n"

                    "text": "The issue here revolves around the concept of lateral support and subjacent support in the context of property damage caused by a drainage system.\n\n1. **Lateral Support**: This refers to the support provided by the land adjacent to the property that is affected by the drainage system. If the drainage system is causing damage to the sister's land, the sister would be entitled to support from the adjacent land, which is the woman's land.\n\n2. **Subjacent Support**: This refers to the support provided by the land below the property that is affected by the drainage system. If the drainage system is causing damage to the sister's land, the sister would be entitled to support from the land below her land, which is the woman's land.\n\nGiven the facts provided:\n\n- The sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman in 2005.\n- The drainage system extended across all three parcels of land.\n- The drainage system caused damage to the sister's land.\n\nSince the sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman, the sister would be entitled to support from the adjacent land, which is the woman's land. Therefore, the sister is entitled to support for her land in its natural condition.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.**"
