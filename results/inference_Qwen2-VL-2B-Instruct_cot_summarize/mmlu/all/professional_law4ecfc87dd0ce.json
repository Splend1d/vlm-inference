The longshoreman was an employee of a company that had contracted with the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. The fall occurred at night, when loading work was over for the day, and there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch. A negligence action was filed against the ship's owner for the death of the longshoreman. In that action, the owner has moved for summary judgment and has provided unrebutted evidence that it is customary for the crews of ships to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ships. How should the court respond to the motion?\n\nA. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.\nB. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.\nC. Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed.\nD. Grant the motion, because the custom should be considered conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n"

The custom is relevant because it is a common practice that could have contributed to the longshoreman's fall.\n\n2. **Probability of Serious Injury**: The court should consider the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch. If the probability of serious injury is high, the custom could be relevant to the issue of negligence. However, if the probability is low, the custom might not be as relevant.\n\n3. **Conclusiveness of the Custom**: The court should not grant the motion for summary judgment because the custom is relevant but not conclusive. If the custom is relevant, it could be used to support a finding of negligence, but it cannot be used to conclusively determine the issue of negligence.\n\n4. **Instructions to the Jury**: The court should instruct the jury to consider the custom as relevant but not conclusive. The jury should be told that the custom is relevant because it is a common practice that could have contributed to the longshoreman's fall, but it should not be used to conclusively determine the issue of negligence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed."
