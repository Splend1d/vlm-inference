Contagion\n\nTheories that best explain the scenario of a car accident where one man stops his car and starts helping people, followed by others stopping and helping, are:\n\nA. Convergence: This theory suggests that people will move towards a common goal or destination, but it doesn't explain the initial behavior of the first person stopping his car.\n\nB. Emergent-norm: This theory suggests that a shared norm or behavior emerges from the actions of individuals, but it doesn't explain the initial behavior of the first person stopping his car.\n\nD. Value-added: This theory suggests that people will help others if they perceive a benefit or value in doing so, but it doesn't explain the initial behavior of the first person stopping his car.\n\nThe most appropriate theory in this scenario is Contagion, which suggests that people will follow the actions of the first person and stop their own car to help others."
