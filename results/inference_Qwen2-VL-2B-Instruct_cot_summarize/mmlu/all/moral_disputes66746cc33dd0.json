Ashford is likely discussing the effectiveness of altruistic efforts in addressing global poverty, and he is suggesting that we should recognize that we have backup duties to donate to aid agencies.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism.\n- This option suggests that Ashford is acknowledging the criticism that effective altruism is not the right response to global poverty. This aligns with his argument that we should recognize backup duties to aid agencies.\n\nB. Acknowledge that effective altruism fails to be the right response to global poverty.\n- This option directly addresses Ashford's argument that effective altruism is not the right response to global poverty. It aligns with his claim that we should recognize backup duties.\n\nC. Feel relieved about our duties to the global poor, since backup duties are not morally urgent.\n- This option suggests that Ashford is relieved about our duties to the global poor because backup duties are not morally urgent. This contradicts Ashford's argument, which is that we should recognize backup duties.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This option is incorrect because Ashford's argument is clearly about recognizing backup duties and acknowledging the effectiveness of altruistic efforts.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\nA. Acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism."
