The purpose of the contract was understood by both parties.\n\nA neighbor's home repair contract is discharged for frustration of purpose if a supervening event occurs that completely or almost completely destroys the purpose of the contract. This event must be reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract formation. However, the purpose of the contract must be understood by both parties for the discharge to be effective. Therefore, the purpose of the contract must be understood by both parties to be discharged for frustration of purpose."
