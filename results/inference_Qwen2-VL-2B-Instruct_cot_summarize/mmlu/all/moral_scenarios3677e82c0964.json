Reading someone else's diary without their consent is generally considered morally wrong, as it violates their privacy and autonomy. In Scenario 2, the main character is working hard to receive a good grade, which is a common goal in academic settings. While it may not be the most ethical approach, it is not inherently morally wrong in itself. The main character's actions are more aligned with the societal norms of striving for academic success and maintaining a good reputation."
