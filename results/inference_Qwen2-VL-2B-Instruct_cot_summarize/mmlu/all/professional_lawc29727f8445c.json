While he was watching television in his hotel room, a thief picked the lock on the hotel room door, entered, hit the traveler over the head, and stole his wallet. The traveler, who suffered a concussion, was hospitalized for three days. The lock on the hotel room door fully complied with a local ordinance that prescribed minimum security standards for hotel locks. If the injured traveler asserts a claim against the hotel for damages for his injury and loss of his wallet, the traveler will\n\nA. prevail, if the lock was defectively designed.\nB. prevail, because he was a business visitor on the hotel's property.\nC. not prevail, because the thief's act was an intervening cause.\nD. not prevail, if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n"

The hotel's lock was not the cause of the traveler's injury, but rather the thief's act of entering the hotel room and stealing the wallet.\n\n2. **Intervening Cause**: The traveler's injury and loss of his wallet were not caused by the thief's act of entering the hotel room and stealing his wallet. The traveler's injury and loss of his wallet were caused by the thief's act of entering the hotel room and stealing his wallet, which was an independent event.\n\nGiven these points, the traveler's injury and loss of his wallet were not caused by the hotel's negligence. Therefore, the traveler will not prevail against the hotel for damages for his injury and loss of his wallet.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. not prevail, because the thief's act was an intervening cause."
