This action is not inherently morally wrong, as it is a professional decision based on the client's financial status. However, it could be seen as unethical if it leads to a conflict of interest or if it is perceived as favoring wealthy clients over less fortunate ones.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character made sure to take some hotel robes and towels as a souvenir. This action is clearly morally wrong. Taking hotel items as a souvenir is considered theft, which is a violation of property rights and is generally considered unethical and illegal."
