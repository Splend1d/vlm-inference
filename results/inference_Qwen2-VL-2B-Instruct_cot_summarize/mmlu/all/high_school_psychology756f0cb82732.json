In the context of Edy's campaign, if she gives out cookies with \"Vote for Edy\" messages, this could create a positive association in the minds of voters, making them more likely to support her if they already have a positive opinion of her. This can improve her chances in the election by creating a sense of trust and familiarity with her."
