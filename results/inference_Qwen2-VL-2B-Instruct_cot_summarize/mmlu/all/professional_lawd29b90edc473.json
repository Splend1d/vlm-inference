One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\nB. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.\nC. The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.\nD. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n"

The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n\nThis is because the two men agreed to commit a burglary, and the alarm specialist agreed to assist them in disarming the security system. The two men then proceeded to commit the burglary, which is a crime in itself. The alarm specialist's participation in the crime, even if he did not want to, is still considered a crime because he was involved in the planning and execution of the burglary."
