It is a form of conditional reasoning where the conclusion is contingent on the antecedent.\n\nB. **Categorical**: This type of argument involves affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent. It is a form of categorical reasoning where the conclusion is universal.\n\nC. **Disjunctive**: This type of argument involves affirming the antecedent and denying the consequent. It is a form of disjunctive reasoning where the conclusion is not universal.\n\nD. **Conditional (or hypothetical)**: This type of argument involves affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent. It is a form of conditional reasoning where the conclusion is contingent on the antecedent.\n\nGiven the statement, the minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. This aligns with the structure of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is contingent on the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Conditional (or hypothetical)"
