These barriers can also lead to higher prices and lower profits for existing firms. However, they are not required in order for a firm to earn short-run profits. Short-run profits can be earned by firms that are able to produce at a lower cost than their competitors, regardless of whether they have patents, control of resources, economies of scale, or exclusive licenses."
