These traits are often seen as more stable and less influenced by environmental factors.\n\nNurture, on the other hand, refers to the environmental factors and experiences that influence an individual's development. These factors can include social, cultural, and educational experiences.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can analyze each option:\n\nA. Structural and anatomical; psychological and social\n- This option suggests that structural and anatomical differences are more influenced by nature, while psychological and social differences are more influenced by nurture. This is not consistent with the given context.\n\nB. Psychological and social; structural and anatomical\n- This option suggests that psychological and social differences are more influenced by nurture, while structural and anatomical differences are more influenced by nature. This is also not consistent with the given context.\n\nC. Structural and psychological; anatomical and social\n- This option suggests that structural and psychological differences are more influenced by nature, while anatomical and social differences are more influenced by nurture. This is consistent with the given context, as it aligns with the idea that nature is more important for structural and anatomical differences and nurture is more important for psychological and social differences.\n\nD. Social and anatomical; psychological and structural\n- This option suggests that social and anatomical differences are more influenced by nurture, while psychological and structural differences are more influenced by nature. This is not consistent with the given context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Structural and psychological; anatomical and social"
