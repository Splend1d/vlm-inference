However, the moral implications of these actions vary significantly. \n\nIn Scenario 1, pushing the elderly woman around the park is clearly morally wrong. It involves physical harm and aggression towards an elderly individual, which is considered a serious violation of social norms and ethical standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pouring cement into a bowl and telling the daughter to eat it is also morally wrong. This action is considered cruel and inhumane, as it involves intentionally harming the daughter with a substance that could be toxic or harmful.\n\nTherefore, the main character's actions in both scenarios are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
