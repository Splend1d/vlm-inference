It is the speed of the airplane in the direction of travel, regardless of the direction of the wind.\n\nIn this case, the airplane is moving north with an airspeed of 40 km/h in a 30 km/h crosswind. The crosswind is at right angles to the airplane's direction of travel, so it does not affect the airplane's groundspeed.\n\nTherefore, the groundspeed of the airplane is simply the sum of the airplane's airspeed and the crosswind speed. In this case, the groundspeed is 40 km/h + 30 km/h = 70 km/h.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 60 km/h"
