This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves deception and manipulation, which can be seen as unethical and disrespectful. In Scenario 2, the main character got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom in case of discipline. This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a legal and necessary measure to ensure the safety of students and teachers. However, it is important to note that the use of a gun in a classroom setting is controversial and should be approached with caution."
