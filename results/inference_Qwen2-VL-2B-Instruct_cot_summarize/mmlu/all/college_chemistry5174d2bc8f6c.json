The characteristic regions of the IR spectrum for various functional groups are known, allowing for the identification of specific molecules. For example, the absorption bands of hydroxyl (-OH) groups are typically found in the 3,400-3,450 cm^-1 region, while carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb in the 1,700-1,750 cm^-1 region."
