The forward force of the horse on the cart is greater than the backward force of the cart on the horse, providing a forward acceleration.\n\nWhen a horse is attached to a cart, the force of the horse's muscles on the rest of the horse-cart system is the primary force that accelerates the system. This force is greater than the force of the cart on the horse, which is the backward force. The net result is that the horse-cart system accelerates forward due to the muscle force."
