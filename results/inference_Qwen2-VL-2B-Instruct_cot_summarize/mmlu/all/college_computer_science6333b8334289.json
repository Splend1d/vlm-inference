Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)?\n\nA.

The time complexity of multiplying the first two matrices is \\( pqr \\).\n2. The time complexity of multiplying the first two matrices first is \\( wxy + xzy + yxz \\).\n\nWe need to find a condition that makes the first expression smaller than the second expression. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ pqr < wxy + xzy + yxz \\]\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\\[ pqr - wxy - xzy - yxz < 0 \\]\n\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n\\[ (p - w)(q - x)(r - y) < 0 \\]\n\nThis inequality holds true under the condition that the product of the differences between the number of rows and columns of the matrices is negative. This means that the product of the differences between the number of rows and columns of the matrices is negative, which implies that the product of the matrices themselves is positive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z"
