                    "text": " Let's denote the number of ants of Species A on Day 0 as $x$. Then the number of ants of Species B on Day 0 is $30 - x$.\n\nOn Day 1, the number of ants of Species A is $2x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $30 - x$. So the total number of ants on Day 1 is $2x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 2, the number of ants of Species A is $2(2x) = 4x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 2 is $4x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 3, the number of ants of Species A is $2(4x) = 8x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 3 is $8x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 4, the number of ants of Species A is $2(8x) = 16x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 4 is $16x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 5, the number of ants of Species A is $2(16x) = 32x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 5 is $32x + (30 - x) = 3281$.\n\nSolving the equation $32x + (30 - x) = 3281$ for $x$, we get $31x = 3251$, so $x = 101$.\n\nTherefore, the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is $32x = 32 \\cdot 101 = 3232$.\n\nSo the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 3232, which is not listed among the options. Let's reevaluate the problem.\n\nWe know that the total number of ants on Day 5 is 3281, and the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 3232. So the number of ants of Species B on Day 5 is $3281 - 3232 = 49$.\n\nOn Day 4, the number of ants of Species A is $2(16x) = 32x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 4 is $32x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 3, the number of ants of Species A is $2(8x) = 16x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 3 is $16x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 2, the number of ants of Species A is $2(4x) = 8x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 2 is $8x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 1, the number of ants of Species A is $2(2x) = 4x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 1 is $4x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nSolving the equation $30 + (30 - x) = 3281$, we get $60 = 3281$, which is not true. Let's reevaluate the problem again.\n\nWe know that the total number of ants on Day 5 is 3281, and the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 3232. So the number of ants of Species B on Day 5 is $3281 - 3232 = 49$.\n\nOn Day 4, the number of ants of Species A is $2(16x) = 32x$, and the number of ants of Species B is $(30 - x)$. So the total number of ants on Day 4 is $32x + (30 - x) = 30$.\n\nOn Day 3, the number of"
