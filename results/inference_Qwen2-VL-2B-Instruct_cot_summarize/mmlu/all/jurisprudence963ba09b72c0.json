Both adopt a liberal ideology.\n\nCritical Legal Studies (CLS) is often compared to American realism, but it is not a liberal ideology. CLS is a legal theory that focuses on the application of law in real-world situations, while realism is a philosophical and political theory that focuses on the nature of reality and the role of law in society. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
