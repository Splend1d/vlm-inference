They are responsible for generating energy through cellular respiration. Therefore, the mitochondria of a plant and those of an animal are homologous, as they are derived from a common ancestor and have similar functions.\n\nThe other options are likely to represent homology because:\n\nA. The wings of a bat and the arms of a human are homologous, as they are derived from a common ancestor and have similar functions.\nB. The hemoglobin of a baboon and that of a gorilla are homologous, as they are derived from a common ancestor and have similar functions.\nD. The wings of a bird and those of an insect are homologous, as they are derived from a common ancestor and have similar functions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
