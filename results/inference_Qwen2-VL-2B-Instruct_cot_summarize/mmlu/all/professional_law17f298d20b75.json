The defendant was taken directly from the scene of the crime in a patrol car to the police station where he was placed, still handcuffed, in an interview room. He waited for about an hour, and a detective finally came in. The detective gave the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to sign the waiver and speak to the detective. The defendant then confessed to the robbery. Which of the following allegations would be LEAST helpful in suppressing his statement?\n\nA. Before the defendant gave the statement he was refused permission to use the bathroom.\nB. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\nC. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\nD. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\n"

The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\nD. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\n\nThe reason is that these allegations suggest that the defendant was not informed about his rights and was not given the opportunity to understand the Miranda warnings. This can undermine the reliability of the defendant's statement, making it less reliable for the court to consider as evidence. Therefore, the most relevant and least helpful allegations are those that suggest the defendant was not informed about his rights and was not given the opportunity to understand the Miranda warnings."
