Fermentation studies in vitro, with human faeces, have shown that soluble and insoluble forms are fermented completely within 24 hours\nC. Fibre sources, such as hemicelluloses, pectins and inulin are rapidly fermented to short chain fatty acids, which have trophic effects on the colon\nD. Stool bulking occurs mainly through the action of insoluble fibres such as cellulose\n"

Fibre sources, such as hemicelluloses, pectins and inulin are rapidly fermented to short chain fatty acids, which have trophic effects on the colon\n\nThis statement is most correct because it accurately describes the process of how dietary fibre is broken down and absorbed by the body, leading to the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that have beneficial effects on the colon."
