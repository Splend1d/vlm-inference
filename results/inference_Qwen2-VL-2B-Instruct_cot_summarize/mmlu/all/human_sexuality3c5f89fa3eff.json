If Avalon contracted genital herpes she will only be contagious when she has a break out.\n\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus can be transmitted through oral-genital sex, but it is not transmitted through fellatio (oral-genital sex). Therefore, Avalon could not contract genital herpes from performing fellatio on the guy. Additionally, the treatment for genital herpes is not antibiotics, but rather antiviral medications. Finally, the contagiousness of genital herpes is not limited to when a break out occurs, but rather can occur at any time."
