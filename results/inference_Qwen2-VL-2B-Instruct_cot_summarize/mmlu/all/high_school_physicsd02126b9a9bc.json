                    "text": "To calculate the total flight time of the soccer ball, we need to consider both the vertical and horizontal components of its motion. The vertical component of the motion is affected by gravity, and the horizontal component is not affected by gravity.\n\nThe vertical motion of the ball can be described by the equation:\n\\[ y = y_0 + v_{0y}t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( y \\) is the final vertical position,\n- \\( y_0 \\) is the initial vertical position,\n- \\( v_{0y} \\) is the initial vertical velocity,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2),\n- \\( t \\) is the time.\n\nThe initial vertical position \\( y_0 \\) is 0 (since the ball is at rest on the ground), the initial vertical velocity \\( v_{0y} \\) is 10 m/s (the initial velocity), and the acceleration due to gravity \\( g \\) is 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\\[ y = 10t - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot t^2 \\]\n\\[ y = 10t - 4.9t^2 \\]\n\nThe horizontal motion of the ball is unaffected by gravity and can be described by the equation:\n\\[ x = x_0 + v_{0x}t \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( x \\) is the final horizontal position,\n- \\( x_0 \\) is the initial horizontal position,\n- \\( v_{0x} \\) is the initial horizontal velocity.\n\nThe initial horizontal position \\( x_0 \\) is 0 (since the ball is at rest on the ground), and the initial horizontal velocity \\( v_{0x} \\) is 0 (since the ball is at rest on the ground).\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\\[ x = 0 + 0 \\cdot t \\]\n\\[ x = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the total flight time of the soccer ball is the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height and then fall back to the ground. The maximum height is reached when the vertical velocity is zero, which occurs when the vertical position is at its maximum value. The vertical velocity is given by:\n\\[ v_{0y} = v_{0y} \\cos(30\u00b0) \\]\n\\[ v_{0y} = 10 \\cos(30\u00b0) \\]\n\\[ v_{0y} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]\n\\[ v_{0y} = 5\\sqrt{3} \\approx 8.66 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nThe time it takes to reach the maximum height is:\n\\[ t_{max} = \\frac{v_{0y}}{g} \\]\n\\[ t_{max} = \\frac{8.66}{9.8} \\approx 0.89 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThe total flight time is the sum of the time it takes to reach the maximum height and the time it takes to fall back to the ground:\n\\[ t_{total} = t_{max} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g \\cdot t_{max}^2 \\]\n\\[ t_{total} = 0.89 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot (0.89)^2 \\]\n\\[ t_{total} = 0.89 + 0.89 \\cdot 0.76841 \\]\n\\[ t_{total} = 0.89 + 0.67 \\]\n\\[ t_{total} = 1.56 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total flight time of the soccer ball is approximately 1.56 seconds, which is closest to option B. 1 s."
