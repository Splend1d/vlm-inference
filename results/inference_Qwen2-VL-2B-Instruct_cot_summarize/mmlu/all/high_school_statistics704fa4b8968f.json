This value is approximately 1.286 (from the z-score formula, where the z-score for the 80th percentile is approximately 0.8413).\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value we're trying to find, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nRearranging for \\( X \\):\n\\[ X = \\mu + z \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ X = 167 + 0.8413 \\cdot 76 \\]\n\\[ X = 167 + 64.0886 \\]\n\\[ X \\approx 231.0886 \\]\n\nSince we're looking for the interval to the nearest minute, we round 231.0886 to the nearest whole number, which is 231 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct interval is:\nB. 53 minutes to 281 minutes"
