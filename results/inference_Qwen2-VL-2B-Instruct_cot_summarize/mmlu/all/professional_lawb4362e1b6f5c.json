As the team was being honored, the star quarterback of the football team approached one of the cheerleaders and asked her out for a date. The cheerleader, who had a crush on the quarterback, said she'd love to go out with him. The quarterback told her, \"Great, I'll pick you up at eight. \"Later that evening, the quarterback was getting ready to drive to the cheerleader's home when his car wouldn't start. The quarterback then called his next-door neighbor and asked him if he could borrow his car. The neighbor agreed, but told him, \"Okay, but make sure you return it by 2:00 a. m. \" The quarterback assented and then drove to the cheerleader's house. After picking her up, they drove to an all-night coffee shop where they spent the night talking and catching up over coffee and waffles. Losing track of time, the quarterback and the cheerleader did not leave the coffee shop until 3:00 a. m. After returning home around 4:00 a. m. , the quarterback decided that it was too late to return the car, so he parked it in his driveway. He intended to return the car to the neighbor in the morning. A short while later, a thief stole the neighbor's car from outside the quarterback's home. The police found the car three months later, undamaged. The neighbor, however, refused to accept the car and brought a claim against the quarterback for conversion. In his claim, the neighbor will\n\nA. succeed, because the quarterback could have returned the car and failed to do so.\nB. succeed, because the quarterback left the car in his driveway, and it was stolen.\nC. not succeed, because the quarterback intended to return the identical property he borrowed in an undamaged condition.\nD. not succeed, because the criminal act of the thief was unforeseeable.\n"

Not succeed, because the quarterback intended to return the identical property he borrowed in an undamaged condition.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The neighbor loaned the quarterback his car, and the quarterback intended to return it in an undamaged condition.\n2. The neighbor did not expect the car to be stolen, and the car was undamaged when the neighbor returned it.\n3. The neighbor refused to accept the car, and the car was stolen by a third party.\n4. The neighbor's claim is based on the intention to return the car in an undamaged condition, which was not fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor cannot succeed in his claim because the car was stolen, not because the quarterback intended to return it in an undamaged condition."
