It identifies four forces that influence the competitive landscape: the threat of substitute products, the threat of new entrants, the power of suppliers, and the power of buyers. The fifth force, which is the level of rivalry, refers to the intensity of competition within the industry. This refers to the number of firms in the industry, the degree of rivalry among firms, and the ease with which new firms can enter the industry. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
