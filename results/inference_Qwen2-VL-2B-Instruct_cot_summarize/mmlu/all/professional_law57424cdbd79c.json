Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband. She proposed to testify that the man confided to her that he did steal the woman's money during the flight. The man's attorney objected on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. The wife's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.\nC. inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.\nD. inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

The testimony is not offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show that the defendant did not steal the money.\n\n2. **Privilege**: The testimony is not privileged because it is not offered to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial. The testimony is not offered to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial, but rather to show that the defendant did not steal the money.\n\nTherefore, the testimony is inadmissible because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay. The prosecution can introduce the testimony to show that the man did not steal the money, but the defense can object on the grounds of hearsay and privilege.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception."
