Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character (who uses I/me/my) did something clearly morally wrong by warning everyone about a fire when they knew there wasn't one. This is because warning people about a potential danger when there is no actual danger is a form of deception and can cause harm to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) took their three-year-old to the theater to see Saw. This is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The main character is taking their child to a movie, which is a common and accepted activity for families. The main character is not engaging in any deceptive behavior or causing harm to others."
