Sally saw the knife just as it whizzed by her head, missing it by about one inch. As a result, Sally was very scared. Sally sued Donny for assault and battery.

Donny will be liable for assault and for battery.\nD. Donny will not be liable for either assault or battery because this is only a criminal matter.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Donny will be liable for assault and for battery.\n\nThis is because Sally was scared due to the close proximity of the knife to her head, which is a clear example of assault. Even though Donny missed Sally, the act of throwing the knife at her was an intentional and harmful act, which is considered assault. Battery, on the other hand, involves a harmful act that causes physical harm to the victim, and since Sally was scared and not physically harmed, she cannot sue for battery. Therefore, Donny is liable for assault but not battery."
