The representativeness heuristic is the tendency to make judgments based on the similarity of an object or situation to a previously experienced one, while the availability heuristic is the tendency to rely on the frequency of an event or information, rather than its actual likelihood. These shortcuts can lead to errors in information processing by making judgments based on superficial cues rather than on a thorough analysis of the information. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
