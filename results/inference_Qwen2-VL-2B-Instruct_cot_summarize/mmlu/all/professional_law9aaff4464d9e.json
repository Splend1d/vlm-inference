The man notified his insurance carrier but was told that his policy had lapsed on July 2. He had earlier received a renewal notice with a bill listing a due date of June 28 and an expiration date of the policy on July 2. The notice welcomed payment by mail, and did not say that renewal was conditioned on actual physical receipt of the check. He had put the check and form in the U.S. mail on June 28, but the insurer did not receive it until July 5. The insurer reinstated the policy as of July 5, leaving a coverage gap from July 2 through July 5, according to the company. Will the courts likely hold that the policy was still effective on July 3, the date of the accident?\n\nA. Yes, because the renewal premium was placed in the mailbox before the date of expiration, and the notice did not say that the check had to be received physically before there could be a renewal.\nB. Yes, because a policy cannot be lapsed for nonpayment without a final 30 day notice of impending lapse being sent.\nC. No, the man knew that the policy would not be renewed if did not get the payment into the insurer's possession by the due date of June 28.\nD. No, because the mail box rule is not applicable in a situation where an insurance policy must be renewed.\n"

The notice did not state that the check had to be physically received before the policy could be reinstated, and the insurer did not receive the check until July 5. Therefore, the courts would likely interpret the notice as not requiring physical receipt of the check, and the policy would be considered to have continued to be in effect until the date of the accident, July 3. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because the renewal premium was placed in the mailbox before the date of expiration, and the notice did not say that the check had to be received physically before there could be a renewal."
