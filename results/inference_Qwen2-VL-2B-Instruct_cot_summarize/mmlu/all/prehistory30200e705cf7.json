One of the reasons for this was the Inca's belief in the importance of maintaining a strong military force to protect the empire and its people. The Inca believed that the young male population was the future of the empire and that it was important to eliminate any potential threats to the empire's stability. This was done through a process called \"killing off the young male population,\" which was believed to prevent any potential revolts or threats to the empire's stability."
