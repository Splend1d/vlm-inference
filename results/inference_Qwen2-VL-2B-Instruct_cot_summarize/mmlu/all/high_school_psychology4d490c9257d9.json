In Erikson's theory, the phallic stage occurs between the ages of 3 and 5 years and is characterized by the struggle between the need for autonomy and the desire for security. This stage is often associated with the development of a sense of self and the ability to make choices. In Freud's theory, the phallic stage is associated with the development of the penis and the desire for sexual activity. Therefore, Erikson's initiative versus guilt stage is most closely related to Freud's phallic stage."
