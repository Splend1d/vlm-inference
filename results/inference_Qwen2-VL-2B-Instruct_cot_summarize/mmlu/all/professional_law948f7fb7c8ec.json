The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. \"A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\nC. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\nD. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n"

Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Privity of Contract**: The landscaper is not a party to the Declaration of Covenants, so there is no privity of contract between the landscaper and the community association. This means the landscaper cannot be held liable for the annual assessment due to the Declaration of Covenants.\n\n2. **Privity of Estate**: The landscaper is not the owner of lot 29, so there is no privity of estate between the landscaper and the gardener. This also means the landscaper cannot be held liable for the annual assessment due to the Declaration of Covenants.\n\n3. **Liens and Charges**: The annual assessment is a charge, not a lien. A lien is a legal right to take possession of the property, whereas a charge is a legal right to receive payment. Since the annual assessment is a charge, the landscaper does not have a personal obligation to pay it.\n\nTherefore, the landscaper cannot be held liable for the annual assessment due to the Declaration of Covenants."
