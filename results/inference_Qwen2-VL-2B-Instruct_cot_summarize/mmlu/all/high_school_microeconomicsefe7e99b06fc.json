This point occurs when the marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost (MC) curve. At this point, the marginal revenue is zero, indicating that the additional revenue generated by selling one more unit of the product is equal to the additional cost of producing that unit. This point is where the marginal benefit of selling one more unit is equal to the marginal cost of producing it, leading to the optimal level of output for the monopolist."
