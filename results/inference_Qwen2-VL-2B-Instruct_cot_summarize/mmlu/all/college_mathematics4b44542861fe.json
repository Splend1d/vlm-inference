The set U is defined as the set of matrices that commute with T, which includes matrices that are not necessarily eigenvectors of T. Therefore, U is not necessarily equal to M(V).\n\n2. **Statement II: dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2**\n   - This statement is false. The sum of the dimensions of U and W is not equal to n^2. The dimensions of U and W are determined by the structure of T and its effect on the matrices in M(V). The exact relationship between the dimensions of U and W depends on the specific properties of T and V.\n\n3. **Statement III: dim (U) < n**\n   - This statement is true. The dimension of U is less than n because U consists of matrices that commute with T, which means they are not necessarily eigenvectors of T. Therefore, the dimension of U is less than n.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is C. III only."
