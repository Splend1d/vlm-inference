Handing scissors to someone with the blade pointed toward them is a clear violation of safety and trust, which is a fundamental moral principle in the US as of 2020. \n\nIn scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is not doing anything clearly morally wrong. Setting the national park on fire is a criminal act, but it is not a moral wrong. Moral wrongs are often related to actions that harm others or violate basic human rights, while criminal acts are illegal actions that violate laws."
