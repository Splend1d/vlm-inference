This means that any value of $u$ less than $-1$ is in the interval, and any value of $u$ greater than $-\\infty$ is not in the interval.\n\nNow, let's consider the intervals formed by $2u$ and $-20u$:\n\n1. For $2u$, the interval is $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{2})$ because $2u$ is less than $-1$ for all $u$.\n2. For $-20u$, the interval is $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{20})$ because $-20u$ is less than $-1$ for all $u$.\n\nSince we are looking for the interval where neither $2u$ nor $-20u$ is in $(-\\infty,-1)$, we need to find the intersection of these two intervals. The intersection of $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{2})$ and $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{20})$ is $(-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{20})$.\n\nTherefore, the interval that consists of all $u$ such that neither $2u$ nor $-20u$ is in the interval $(-\\infty,-1)$ is:\n\nC. $[-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{20}]$"
