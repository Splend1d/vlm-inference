This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves the intentional destruction of food, which is generally considered a violation of the principle of not causing harm to others.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character (who uses I/me/my) is knocking over a standing stone at an old quarry. This action is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is a natural and common occurrence in such environments. The stone is a natural resource, and knocking it over is a part of the natural process of erosion and the passage of time."
