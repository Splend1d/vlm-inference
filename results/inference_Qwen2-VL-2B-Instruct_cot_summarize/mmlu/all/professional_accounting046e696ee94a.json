Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nWhen assessing the tolerable rate of deviations of a test of controls, an auditor should consider the following factors:\n\nA. Deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records.\n- This statement is incorrect. Deviations from pertinent controls can affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records.\n\nB. Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.\n- This statement is incorrect. Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate do not necessarily result in misstatements at a lower rate. Misstatements can occur at any rate, depending on the nature of the deviations and the context of the test.\n\nC. When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk.\n- This statement is incorrect. The degree of assurance desired in a sample is not directly related to the tolerable rate of deviations. The tolerable rate of deviations is determined by the auditor's risk assessment and the risk of material misstatement.\n\nD. Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.\n- This statement is correct. Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls generally increases the tolerable rate of deviations, as it increases the likelihood of detecting deviations from pertinent controls."
