The deed to Hunter and Willa reads as follows: \"To Hunger and Willa and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to Hunter and Brandon, his brother, for $125,000 (Hunter pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and Brandon pays the balance). The deed to Hunter and Brandon provides: \"To Hunter and Brandon and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"On August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and as a consequence, the order of their deaths cannot be established by proof.

In this case, the law of intestate succession applies to the estate of Hunter and Willa.\n\nAccording to the law of intestate succession, the undivided one-half interest in the land is divided equally between Hunter and Willa. Therefore, the undivided one-half interest in the land is divided into two equal parts, which is one-fourth of the land.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
