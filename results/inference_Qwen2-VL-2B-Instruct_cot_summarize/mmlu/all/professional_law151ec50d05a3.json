Common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. The purchase price was $50,000, of which the sister paid $10,000 and the brother paid $40,000. The sisterlater mortgaged her interest in the land. The brother then died testate, leaving his entire estate to a cousin. Thesister later paid off her mortgage debt, and the mortgage was released. At the present time, who owns the land?\n\nA. The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory ofmortgages.\nB. Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\nC. Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.\nD. Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and thecousin having an 80% interest.\n"

The deed conveyed title to the land as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n2. The sister paid $10,000 for the land, and the brother paid $40,000.\n3. The sister mortgaged her interest in the land.\n4. The brother died testate, leaving his entire estate to a cousin.\n5. The sister later paid off her mortgage debt and released the mortgage.\n6. At the present time, the mortgage is no longer in effect, and the sister and the cousin own the land equally.\n\nTherefore, the sister and the cousin own the land equally, as they are joint tenants with right of survivorship."
