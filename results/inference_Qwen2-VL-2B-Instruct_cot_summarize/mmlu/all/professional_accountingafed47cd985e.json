Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nWhen a company declares a stock dividend, the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet will be adjusted to reflect the increase in the number of shares outstanding and the decrease in the par value of the stock. The stock dividend is recorded as an increase in the paid-in capital account, which is credited for the amount of the dividend. In this case, the dividend is 30% of the par value of the stock, which is $10 per share, so the dividend is $300. Therefore, the additional paid-in capital account will be credited for $3,000."
