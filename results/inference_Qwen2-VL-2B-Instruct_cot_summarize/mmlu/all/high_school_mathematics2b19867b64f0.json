For the point (\u20132, 15):\n- For the inequality \\(y > 9x - 8\\), substituting \\(x = -2\\) and \\(y = 15\\) gives \\(15 > 9(-2) - 8\\), which simplifies to \\(15 > -16 - 8\\), or \\(15 > -24\\), which is true.\n- For the inequality \\(y < -x + 8\\), substituting \\(x = -2\\) and \\(y = 15\\) gives \\(15 < -(-2) + 8\\), which simplifies to \\(15 < 2 + 8\\), or \\(15 < 10\\), which is false.\n\nTherefore, the point (\u20132, 15) is not a solution to both inequalities.\n\nThe correct answer is A."
