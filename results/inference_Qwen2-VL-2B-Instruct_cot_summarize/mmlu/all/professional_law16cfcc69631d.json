The following month, the doctor was granted a license to practice optometry in that neighboring state by its board of optometrists. For approximately one year, the doctor was engaged in the practice of optometry in the neighboring state. Subsequently, the doctor decided to relocate his practice to the state for which Section 2022(a) applies. The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice. If the doctor challenges the constitutionality of Section 2022(a) of the medical licensing statute as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following, if factually true, is the WEAKEST defense that the state could offer?\n\nA. The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.\nB. The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\nC. The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.\nD. The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.\n"

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Section 2022(a) restricts optometrists from practicing in a neighboring state unless they have graduated from an optometry school located in the state and are accredited by the state's board of optometrists.\n2. The doctor in question graduated from an optometry school in a neighboring state and was granted a license to practice optometry in that state.\n3. The doctor then relocated to the state where Section 2022(a) applies and opened a new office for optometry.\n4. The doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists and assumed he could practice optometry by reciprocity.\n\nThe question asks which defense the state could offer if challenged on the grounds that Section 2022(a) violates the Commerce Clause.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.\n- This option suggests that the statute aims to ensure the highest quality of optometrists. While this could be a valid defense, it does not directly address the issue of the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nB. The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\n- This option suggests that the statute aims to protect optometrists from competition from outside the state. This could be a valid defense, but it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nC. The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.\n- This option suggests that the statute aims to ensure a steady supply of optometrists within the state. This could be a valid defense, but it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nD. The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.\n- This option suggests that the statute aims to ensure that optometrists are subject to regulatory standards. This could be a valid defense, but it does not directly address the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the question, the most direct and relevant defense that the state could offer is:\n\nC. The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.\n\nThis option directly addresses the practical issue of ensuring a steady supply of optometrists within the state, which is a critical aspect of the constitutionality of the statute."
