A profusion of stone tool traditions, indicating a change from temporal and geographic homogeneity to greater diversity and variability.\n\nThe middle and upper Paleolithic periods are characterized by a variety of stone tool traditions, which suggests a greater diversity and variability in the tools used by early humans. This diversity is reflected in the different types of stone tools used, such as hand axes, scrapers, and choppers, which were used for a wide range of tasks, including cutting, scraping, and grinding. This diversity is a key feature of the Upper Paleolithic period, which is characterized by a greater emphasis on tool use and a greater range of activities that required the use of tools."
