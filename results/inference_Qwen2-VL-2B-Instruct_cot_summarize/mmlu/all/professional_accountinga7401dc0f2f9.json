Consider whether there is substantial doubt about the former client's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBefore reissuing the auditor's report for the prior period, the CPA should assess whether there is any indication of a material weakness or significant uncertainty in the former client's ability to continue as a going concern. This is because the auditor's report is based on the client's ability to meet its financial obligations and maintain its operations. If there is substantial doubt about the client's ability to continue as a going concern, the CPA should consider whether the client should be reclassified as a going concern or whether the report should be modified to reflect this uncertainty."
