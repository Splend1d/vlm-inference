I come to place before the Legislature of Massachusetts the condition of the miserable, the desolate, the outcast. I come as the advocate of helpless, forgotten, insane and idiotic men and women; of beings, sunk to a condition from which the most unconcerned would start with real horror; of beings wretched in our Prisons, and more wretched in our Alms-Houses. . . .\n\"If my pictures are displeasing, coarse, and severe, my subjects, it must be recollected, offer no tranquil, refined, or composing features. The condition of human beings, reduced to the extremest states of degradation and misery, cannot be exhibited in softened language, or adorn a polished page.\n\"I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience!\"\n\u2014Dorothea Dix, \"Memorial to the Massachusetts Legislature\" (1843)\nDorothea Dix's research and testimony is best understood in the context of\n\nA. women gaining the right to vote in many states.\nB. an economic downturn that was responsible for the closure of many state institutions.\nC. an evolving relationship between the federal government and issues of health and poverty.\nD. the rise of voluntary organizations to promote religious and secular reforms.\n"

The context of her work is best understood in the context of an evolving relationship between the federal government and issues of health and poverty. This period saw the rise of voluntary organizations, such as the American Red Cross, which were established to address the needs of the poor and the sick. Dix's work was part of a larger effort to improve the lives of those who were marginalized and to advocate for policies that would address the underlying causes of poverty and illness."
