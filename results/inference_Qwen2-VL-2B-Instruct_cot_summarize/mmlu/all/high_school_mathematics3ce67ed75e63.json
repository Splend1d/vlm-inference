The probability of rolling a 1 on a standard die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, the probability of rolling a 2 on a standard die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of rolling a 9 on a standard die is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 1, 2, and 9 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{216}$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the number of ways to roll a 1, 2, and 9 because the order in which we roll the dice does not matter. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the numbers 1, 2, and 9, so we need to divide the number of ways by 6 to correct for this overcounting. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 1, 2, and 9 is $\\frac{1}{216} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{1296}$.\n\nHowever, we have also overcounted the number of ways to roll a 1, 2, and 9 because the numbers on the dice are independent. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the numbers 1, 2, and 9, so we need to divide the number of ways by 3 to correct for this overcounting. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 1, 2, and 9 is $\\frac{1}{1296} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{396}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $abc = 180$ is $\\frac{1}{396}$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{72}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{72}}$."
