In this case, the ladder forms a right-angled triangle with the ground and the wall.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(L\\) as the length of the ladder (9 meters),\n- \\(h\\) as the height of the ladder on the wall (which is the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground),\n- \\(x\\) as the distance the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall (which is the rate at which the bottom end is moved, 2 meters per second),\n- \\(y\\) as the distance the top end of the ladder is sliding downward along the wall (which is the rate at which the top end is sliding downward, which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation for the Pythagorean theorem as follows:\n\\[L^2 = h^2 + x^2\\]\n\nWe are given that \\(L = 9\\) meters and \\(x = 2\\) meters per second. We need to find \\(y\\), which is the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n\\[9^2 = h^2 + 2^2\\]\n\\[81 = h^2 + 4\\]\n\\[h^2 = 81 - 4\\]\n\\[h^2 = 77\\]\n\\[h = \\sqrt{77}\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward, which is \\(y\\). We know that \\(h = \\sqrt{77}\\) meters and \\(x = 2\\) meters per second. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find \\(y\\):\n\\[y^2 = h^2 - x^2\\]\n\\[y^2 = (\\sqrt{77})^2 - 2^2\\]\n\\[y^2 = 77 - 4\\]\n\\[y^2 = 73\\]\n\\[y = \\sqrt{73}\\]\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward is \\(\\sqrt{73}\\) meters per second, which is approximately \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\) meters per second. The correct answer is C."
