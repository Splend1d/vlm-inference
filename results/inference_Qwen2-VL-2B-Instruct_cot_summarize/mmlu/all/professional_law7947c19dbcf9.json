Upon objection by the pedestrian's attorney, the trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. sustain the objection, as violative of the physician-patient privilege.\nC. overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\nD. overrule the objection, as a statement against interest.\n"
