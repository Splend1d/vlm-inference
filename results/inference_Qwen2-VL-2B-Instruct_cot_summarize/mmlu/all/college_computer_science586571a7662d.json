If P is recursive, it must have local variables to store the values of the recursive calls. Therefore, statement I is true.\n\n2. **Execution Path**: A recursive procedure does not have an execution path where it does not call itself. This is because the procedure is defined to call itself repeatedly. Therefore, statement II is true.\n\n3. **Global Variables**: A global variable is a variable that is defined outside any procedure and is accessible from anywhere in the program. If P is recursive, it cannot refer to a global variable because it is defined to call itself repeatedly. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\n4. **Parameters**: A parameter is a variable that is passed to a procedure as an argument. If P is recursive, it must have at least one parameter to pass to the recursive call. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and II only"
