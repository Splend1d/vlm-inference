The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nWhen consumers are advised that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer, this information is likely to increase consumer demand for multigrained bread. This is because the health benefits of multigrained bread are perceived as a positive attribute, leading consumers to seek out and purchase it. As a result, the demand for multigrained bread will increase, shifting the demand curve to the right. This shift will cause the equilibrium price of multigrained bread to rise, as the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied."
