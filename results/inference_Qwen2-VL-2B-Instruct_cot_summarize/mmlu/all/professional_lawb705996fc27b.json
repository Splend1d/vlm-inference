The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor \"only when expressly accepted by the distributor.\" For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.\nB. No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.\nC. Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.\nD. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n"

However, the distributor's written agreement clearly states that orders are binding only when expressly accepted. The retailer's forwarding of orders did not create an obligation to fill them, but it did not create an obligation to accept them either. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nB. **No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.**\n   - This option suggests that the retailer's overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order. However, the distributor's refusal to fill the order was based on the retailer's practice of overcharging customers, not the retailer's own actions. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nC. **Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.**\n   - This option suggests that the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order. This is correct because the distributor's refusal to fill the order was based on the retailer's practice of overcharging customers, not on the distributor's own actions. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nD. **Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.**\n   - This option suggests that the distributor's course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order. However, the distributor's refusal to fill the order was based on the retailer's practice of overcharging customers, not on the distributor's own actions. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe retailer will likely prevail if the retailer's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order."
