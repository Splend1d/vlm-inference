Plato's argument revolves around the nature of knowledge and how it is acquired. Let's break down the options:\n\nA. From the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\n- This option suggests that we have innate knowledge of the world based on sensory experiences. Plato does not make this claim. He argues that knowledge is not innate but rather acquired through the process of understanding and thinking.\n\nB. Since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\n- This option suggests that we can know things about the sensible world with certainty if we rely solely on our senses. Plato does not make this claim. He argues that we can know things about the sensible world through the process of understanding and thinking, not just through sensory experience alone.\n\nC. Our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\n- This option suggests that our knowledge of the world is not about the sensible world but about a mathematical and ideal understanding of it. Plato does not make this claim. He argues that our knowledge is about the sensible world itself, not just about its mathematical and ideal aspects.\n\nD. Since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n- This option suggests that our knowledge of things is triggered by sensory experience and cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience. Plato does not make this claim. He argues that our knowledge is based on the understanding and thinking of the sensible world, not just on sensory experience.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that option A does not align with Plato's argument. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. From the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses."
