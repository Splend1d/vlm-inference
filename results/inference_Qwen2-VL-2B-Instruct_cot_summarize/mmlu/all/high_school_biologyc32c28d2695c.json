This similarity best supports which of the following hypotheses?\n\nC. The similarity of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is an example of convergent evolution.\n\nConvergent evolution is the process by which similar structures evolve independently in different species. ATP synthase is a protein complex found in the inner membrane of mitochondria and chloroplasts, which is responsible for generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate. The ATP synthase in bacteria is also similar to that in mitochondria and chloroplasts, suggesting that it has evolved from a common ancestor. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
