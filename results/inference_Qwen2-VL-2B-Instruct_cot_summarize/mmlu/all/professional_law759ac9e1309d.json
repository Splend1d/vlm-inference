The prosecution presented a professor of art history to authenticate each piece. The defense objected on the basis that the museum curator where the paintings were housed had to identify if these were in fact the paintings that were stolen. Assuming that others will testify to the fact of the burglary, is the court likely to reject this witness as being qualified to authenticate the paintings in question, and why or why not?\n\nA. Yes, because art works and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.\nB. Yes, because an outside person may be able to partially authenticate the painting but he can't say whether it is the one that was in the museum or that was stolen.\nC. No, granting the objection will simply waste the court's time if the court has to bring in the museum curator and go through hoops to authenticate the paintings.\nD. No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify that it is the genuine piece of art in question.\n"

The court is likely to consider the museum curator's testimony as the most authoritative and reliable source for authenticating the paintings. The court may also consider the museum curator's expertise and experience in art history and the museum's policies and procedures for handling art. Therefore, the court is likely to reject the museum curator's testimony as qualified to authenticate the paintings in question."
