Her participants were not randomly assigned in her study.\n- This would suggest that the sample was not representative of the population, which could lead to biased conclusions. However, the column does not provide information about the random assignment of participants, so this is not a direct reason for the conclusion's invalidity.\n\nB. The number of respondents from across the country was too small.\n- This would imply that the sample size is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about the population. However, the column does not provide information about the sample size, so this is not a direct reason for the conclusion's invalidity.\n\nC. The study was not replicated.\n- This would suggest that the results are not consistent across different studies or populations. However, the column does not provide information about the replication of the study, so this is not a direct reason for the conclusion's invalidity.\n\nD. Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n- This would suggest that the sample may not accurately reflect the characteristics of the population. If the sample is not representative, the conclusions drawn from the sample may not be generalizable to the population. This is a direct reason for the conclusion's invalidity.\n\nTherefore, the most valid reason for the conclusion's invalidity is:\n\nD. Her sample may not have been representative of the population."
