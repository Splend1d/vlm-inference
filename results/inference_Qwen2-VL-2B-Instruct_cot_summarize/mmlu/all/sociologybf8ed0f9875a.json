Suburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased.\n\nAs the new highway extends from a major city through an area used for farmland, it is likely to encourage suburbanization. This is because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased, making it more convenient for people to live in the suburbs and commute to work or other activities in the city. This can lead to a shift in population from the rural farmland area to the suburban areas."
