This is because the product liability doctrine requires that the defendant had a duty to warn of the potential dangers associated with the product and that they failed to do so.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.\nThis is not necessarily relevant to the product liability issue. The duty to warn is based on the defendant's knowledge of the defect, not their role as a merchant.\n\nB. Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition.\nThis is the key point. If Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition, they would be liable for the defect in the product. This is the standard for product liability.\n\nC. Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems with Sipep products.\nThis is not relevant to the product liability issue. The duty to warn is based on the defendant's knowledge of the defect, not on prior notice of similar problems.\n\nD. Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can.\nThis is not relevant to the product liability issue. The duty to warn is based on the defendant's knowledge of the defect, not on their actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition"
