The MPC (Multiplier) is 0.75.\n\nThe relationship between government spending, taxes, and the multiplier is given by the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{MPC}} \\]\n\nGiven that the MPC is 0.75, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \\]\n\nThis means that the government spending and tax increases will lead to a fourfold increase in the economy's output.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Expansionary\n- The multiplier is 4, which is expansionary.\n\nB. Expansionary\n- The multiplier is 4, which is expansionary.\n\nC. Contractionary\n- The multiplier is 4, which is expansionary.\n\nD. Contractionary\n- The multiplier is 4, which is expansionary.\n\nSince the government spending and tax increases are the same and lead to a fourfold increase in output, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. expansionary**"
