This action is generally considered morally right because it is a common practice to return lost property to its rightful owner. In Scenario 2, the main character made a painting in the style of Picasso to study Picasso's technique. This action is not necessarily morally wrong, as it is a creative and educational activity. However, it is important to note that the act of copying someone else's work without permission is generally considered unethical and could be seen as plagiarism."
