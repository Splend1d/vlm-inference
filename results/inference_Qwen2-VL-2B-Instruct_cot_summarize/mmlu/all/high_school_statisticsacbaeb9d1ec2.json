                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\nThis is because the given information indicates that the total cholesterol level in a large population of people is strongly skewed right, with a mean of 210 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 15 mg/dL. This means that the distribution of cholesterol levels is not symmetric and is skewed to the right. \n\nWhen we repeatedly draw samples of size 16 from this population, the sampling distribution of these sample means will be approximately normal. This is because the mean of the sampling distribution will be the same as the population mean, and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution will be the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. In this case, the population mean is 210 mg/dL and the population standard deviation is 15 mg/dL, so the standard deviation of the sampling distribution will be 15/\u221a16 = 3.75 mg/dL. \n\nTherefore, the shape of the sampling distribution of these sample means is approximately normal with a mean of 210 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 3.75 mg/dL."
