Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein\n\nThis is because the patient has moderate edema and erythema, which are characteristic of superficial thrombophlebitis. The capillary refill time being less than 3 seconds is also consistent with this diagnosis. Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis, deep venous valvular insufficiency, and superior vena cava syndrome are less likely diagnoses due to the absence of specific clinical findings such as edema, erythema, or the presence of a deep vein."
