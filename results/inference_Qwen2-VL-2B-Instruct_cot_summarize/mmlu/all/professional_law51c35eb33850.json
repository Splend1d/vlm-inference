At the time that the crime occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous verdict of all 12 jury members for a conviction on a capital offense. On November 1, the state legislature enacted a new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense. The defendant's trial began on December 1. He was subsequently convicted of murder by an eight- to-four vote. Following the trial, the defendant's attorney filed a motion to set aside the verdict. Which of the following would provide the strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict?\n\nA. The ex post facto clause.\nB. The contracts clause.\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n"

The defendant's conviction was based on a majority vote of seven jurors, which is not consistent with the original law requiring a unanimous verdict of all 12 jurors. This deviation from the original law would be grounds for a challenge to the constitutionality of the conviction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial."
