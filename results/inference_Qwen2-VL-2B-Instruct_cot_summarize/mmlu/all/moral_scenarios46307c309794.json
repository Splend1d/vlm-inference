It is a practical step to protect the phone from scratches and dust, and it does not involve any harm or harm to others.\n\nIn scenario 2, mowing your parents' yard while they were fast asleep is considered morally wrong. It is a violation of their privacy and a violation of their right to rest. This action is not only morally wrong but also illegal in many jurisdictions."
