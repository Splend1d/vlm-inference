A law that is discriminatory on its face.**\n   - A law that is discriminatory on its face is inherently discriminatory because it is explicitly designed to discriminate. This is a clear indication of intent to discriminate.\n\n2. **B. A discriminatory application of a facially neutral law.**\n   - A discriminatory application of a facially neutral law is not inherently discriminatory. It is neutral in its application but can still be discriminatory if it has a discriminatory effect. This does not require intent to discriminate.\n\n3. **C. A discriminatory effect.**\n   - A discriminatory effect is a clear indication of intent to discriminate. If a law has a discriminatory effect, it is inherently discriminatory and requires intent to discriminate.\n\n4. **D. A discriminatory motive.**\n   - A discriminatory motive is a clear indication of intent to discriminate. If a law has a discriminatory motive, it is inherently discriminatory and requires intent to discriminate.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that does not require intent to discriminate to prove a discriminatory classification is:\n\n**B. A discriminatory application of a facially neutral law.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
