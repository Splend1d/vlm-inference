She has had similar episodes over the past 6 months. The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. She says that she has had a great deal of stress. She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time, she seldom drank alcohol. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL. Intravenous glucose is administered, and the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies\nB. Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations\nC. Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations\nD. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\n"

These hormones are known to be elevated in patients with Cushing's syndrome, which can cause symptoms similar to those described by the patient. Additionally, the patient's history of alcohol consumption and stress may also be relevant in the diagnosis."
