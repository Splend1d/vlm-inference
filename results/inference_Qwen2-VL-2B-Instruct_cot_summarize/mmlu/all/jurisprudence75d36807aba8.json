Hart argues that the certification of something as legally valid does not necessarily mean that it is morally valid. He suggests that the official system of law may have a great aura of majesty and authority, but it must still be subjected to a moral scrutiny.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. That there is no moral duty to obey an unjust law."
