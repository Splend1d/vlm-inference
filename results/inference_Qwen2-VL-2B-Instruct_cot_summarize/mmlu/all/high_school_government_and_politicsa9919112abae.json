The president's nominees must be approved by the Senate before taking office is true.\n- B. Two-thirds of the Senate must approve presidentially negotiated treaties is true.\n- D. Congress can override a presidential veto is true.\n\nHowever, C. The president can override a congressional veto and pass laws is not true. The president cannot override a congressional veto and pass laws. The veto is a formal rejection of a bill by the president, and the Congress must then pass the bill again to become law."
