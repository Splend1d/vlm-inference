                    "text": "It has been argued by Braun and Chyba (2004) that indigenous nuclear programs are making proliferation safeguards obsolete. In what ways, if any, can a case be made to support this argument?\n\nA. WMD may provide the means to offset inferiority in conventional armaments compared to regional or superpower rivals. Possession of WMD may act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threat, or be used to defeat their adversaries if engaged in combat. WMD capabilities may also be developed to gain automatic status and diplomatic influence amongst the international community.\nB. Although there are fears posed by WMD proliferation that terrorists may gain the capacity to develop weapons, it would remain very difficult to construct even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon. However, whilst nuclear capabilities may be elusive, international or domestic terrorist networks may have the resources to construct and use chemical, biological, and radiological weapons.\nC. WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured. This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time. What separates WMD from conventional weapons is the potential to cause high level destruction. Because of the psychological fear possession can generate, WMD will remain highly desirable as a political weapon.\nD. All of these options.\n"

It discusses the potential for WMD to act as a deterrent to stronger opponents and to defeat adversaries in combat, but it does not address the argument that these programs are making safeguards obsolete.\n\nOption B is also not relevant to the argument that indigenous nuclear programs are making safeguards obsolete. It discusses the difficulty of constructing even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon, but it does not address the argument that these programs are making safeguards obsolete.\n\nOption C is relevant to the argument that indigenous nuclear programs are making safeguards obsolete. It discusses the potential for WMD to cause high level destruction and the potential for WMD to remain highly desirable as a political weapon, which could undermine the effectiveness of safeguards.\n\nOption D is the correct answer. All of the options provided address the argument that indigenous nuclear programs are making safeguards obsolete."
