We can use the following relationships to find these values:\n\n1. For 70% of the trucks weighing more than 12,000 pounds:\n\\[ 0.70 \\times \\mu = 12,000 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{12,000}{0.70} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 17,1429 \\]\n\n2. For 80% of the trucks weighing more than 10,000 pounds:\n\\[ 0.80 \\times \\mu = 10,000 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{10,000}{0.80} \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 12,500 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the standard deviation (\u03c3) using the relationship between the mean and standard deviation:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\mu - \\mu}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{17,1429^2}{17,1429 - 12,500}} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{2,999,999}{4,6429}} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{0.6499} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma \\approx 0.799 \\]\n\nTherefore, the mean weight of the trucks is approximately 17,1429 pounds, and the standard deviation is approximately 0.799 pounds. The closest option to these values is:\n\nD. \u03bc = 15,500; \u03c3 = 6400\n\nSo, the correct answer is D."
