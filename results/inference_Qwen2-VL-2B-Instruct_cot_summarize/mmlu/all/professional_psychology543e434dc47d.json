This conclusion is not valid if the experiment fails to account for the phenomenon of regression toward the mean, which is the tendency for individuals to return to their baseline levels of performance or behavior after a change. \n\nRegression toward the mean can occur in any experiment, regardless of whether the treatment is effective or not. Therefore, the conclusion that the treatment is effective with extreme cases is not valid if the experiment does not account for this phenomenon.\n\nThe other options are not relevant to the experimenter's conclusion. The \"placebo effect\" is not relevant to the severity of the disturbance, and historical and maturational variables are not relevant to the severity of the disturbance either."
