Her face frozen in a grotesque grimace, she demanded to speak to the doctor. The doctor said, \"Listen, why don't you go over to the emergency room and send the bills to me? I'll take care of your medical expenses. \" The patient subsequently sued the doctor for negligent hiring of the medical assistant and for damages. At trial, she proposes to call the doctor's administrative assistant, who was present during her conversation with the doctor. The patient wants the administrative assistant to testify to the doctor's offer to pay her medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the patient's medical records are the best evidence of the doctor's negligence.\nB. sustain the objection as an offer to pay the medical bills.\nC. overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring.\nD. overrule the objection, because an offer to pay medical bills is an inferential admission.\n"

The patient's attorney wants to call the administrative assistant to testify to the offer to pay the medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects to this testimony.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the administrative assistant's testimony is relevant to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring. The patient's attorney argues that the administrative assistant's testimony is relevant because it would show that the doctor offered to pay the patient's medical bills, which could be evidence of the doctor's negligence.\n\nThe trial judge should overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring. The administrative assistant's testimony would provide a direct link between the doctor's offer to pay the patient's medical bills and the doctor's alleged negligence. This testimony would help establish the doctor's liability for the negligence that led to the patient's injury.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring."
