The FED sells government securities in the secondary market.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve sells government securities in the secondary market, it reduces the supply of money in the economy. This is because the sale of securities reduces the amount of money that banks can lend out, which in turn reduces the money supply. The other options (A, C, and D) do not directly affect the money supply."
