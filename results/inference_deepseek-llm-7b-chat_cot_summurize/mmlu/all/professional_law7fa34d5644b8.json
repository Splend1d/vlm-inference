In this case, the furniture store is potentially liable for the employee's negligence in running through a stop sign and hitting the car, leading to the driver's leg injury.\n\nIf the furniture store brings a suit against its employee to recover for its losses, it may recover the amount of $25,000. However, if the furniture store was fully insured against such losses, it would be protected from having to pay out of pocket for the damages. In this scenario, the employee would have to pay the $25,000 to the furniture store, which could then pay the insurance company for the damages.\n\nAlternatively, if the furniture store and employee share equal responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries, the furniture store would only recover $12,500. However, since the employee was at fault in causing the accident, the furniture store would recover the full $25,000, unless it was fully insured against such losses.",
