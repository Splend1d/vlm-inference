Pan-Africanism\nB. Communism\nC. African socialism\nD. Neocolonialism\n\nassistant:The passage is written by Kwame Nkrumah, a Ghanaian leader, and he argues that a political union of African states can contribute to the peace of the world by avoiding disunity and demonstrating the African personality. He also criticizes the Great Powers for disregarding African independence. Based on this information, Nkrumah's argument most clearly supports the ideology of Pan-Africanism. Pan-Africanism is the belief in the unity and solidarity of all people of African ancestry and the promotion of African independence, culture, and economic development. It aligns with Nkrumah's call for a political union of African states and his criticism of the Great Powers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Pan-Africanism.",
