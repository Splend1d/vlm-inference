Homo habilis\n\nHomo habilis is the species most typically associated with the fashioning and use of stone tools. These early humans are known for their simple stone tools, which were used for tasks such as hunting and preparing food. They lived between 2.8 and 1.4 million years ago.\n\nArdipithecus ramidus, Homo sapiens, and Australopithecus robustus are all human species, but they are not typically associated with the fashioning and use of stone tools.",
