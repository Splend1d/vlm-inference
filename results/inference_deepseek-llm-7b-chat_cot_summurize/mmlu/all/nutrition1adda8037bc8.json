This recommendation is based on the evidence that reducing the intake of free sugars can help to reduce the risk of obesity, dental caries, and other health problems. Free sugars include sugars added to food and drinks by the consumer, as well as those naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices. The WHO recommends that adults and children should consume less than 10% of their total daily energy intake from free sugars.",
