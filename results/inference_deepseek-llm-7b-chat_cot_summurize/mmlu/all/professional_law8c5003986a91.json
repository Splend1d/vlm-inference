Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements.

The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher.

The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nIn this case, the millionaire had been using the water from the stream for irrigation purposes prior to 1956, and had established a prescriptive easement on the water. This means that he has a right to the water that is superior to the rancher's domestic use. Additionally, the millionaire has continued to use the water for his farm, and has not stopped using it, which further supports his claim to the water. The fact that the rancher has been taking water from the stream for domestic purposes since 1986 does not override the millionaire's established right to the water, as established by prescription.",
