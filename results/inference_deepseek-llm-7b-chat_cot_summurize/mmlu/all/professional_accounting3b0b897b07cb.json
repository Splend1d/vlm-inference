Joe is considered a tax return preparer because his father is the grantor of the trust.\n\nExplanation:\n\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code, a \"tax return preparer\" is defined as a person who prepares any return, claim, statement, or other document for another person. In this case, since Joe is the trustee of the trust and is responsible for preparing the annual trust tax return, he is considered a tax return preparer. Therefore, he does not need to obtain the written permission of the beneficiary prior to signing as a tax return preparer, and he may sign the return without receiving additional compensation for the tax return.",
