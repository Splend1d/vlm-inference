It includes both goods and services produced domestically and those produced by foreigners in the country. \n\nOn the other hand, GDP is a measure of the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a specific period of time, similar to national income. However, GDP also includes the value of intermediate goods and services used for further production. \n\nDepreciation expenses are an essential part of GDP calculation as they represent the wear and tear of the physical capital used in production. When calculating GDP, depreciation expenses are added back to national income to reflect the value of these worn-out assets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. add depreciation expenses",
