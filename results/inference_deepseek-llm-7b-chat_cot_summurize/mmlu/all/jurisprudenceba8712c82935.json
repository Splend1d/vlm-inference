Right and duty.\nB. Privilege and no-right.\nC. Power and liability.\nD. Immunity and disability.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first need to understand the context of Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations'. After that, I will analyze each option provided and determine which one contradicts Hohfeld's scheme.\n\nStep 1: Understanding Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations'\nHohfeld's scheme is a classification of legal relationships based on the rights and powers they confer or impose. The scheme identifies 17 fundamental relationships, which are:\n\n- Privilege and no-right\n- Right and duty\n- Power and liability\n- Privilege and immunity\n- Immunity and disability\n- Right and immunity\n- Privilege and disability\n- Power and no-right\n- Privilege and duty\n- Power and no-duty\n- Right and duty\n- Right and no-duty\n- Right and no-power\n- Power and duty\n- Right, privilege, power, and immunity\n- Privilege, immunity, and disability\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each option provided\nA. Right and duty.\nB. Privilege and no-right.\nC. Power and liability.\nD. Immunity and disability.\n\nStep 3: Determine which option contradicts Hohfeld's scheme\nA. Right and duty is not a contradiction in Hohfeld's scheme.\nB. Privilege and no-right is a contradiction in Hohfeld's scheme.\nC. Power and liability is not a contradiction in Hohfeld's scheme.\nD. Immunity and disability is not a contradiction in Hohfeld's scheme.\n\nConclusion:\nThe option that contradicts Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations' is:\n\nB. Privilege and no-right.",
