The oxidation number of oxygen (O) is -2. The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion, so ClO4- has a total charge of -1, which means that each chlorine atom contributes +5 and -1 to the overall charge. Since +5 and -1 add up to +4, the oxidation number of chlorine in the perchlorate ion is +4, not +5 as the question states. Therefore, the correct answer is C. -1.",
