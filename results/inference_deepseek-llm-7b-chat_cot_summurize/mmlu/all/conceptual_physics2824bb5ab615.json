Both of these\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:A magnetic force acting on a beam of electrons can change its direction and energy. The electrons in the beam are subjected to an external magnetic field, which influences the movement of the electrons in the beam. As a result, the direction of the electron beam can be altered. Additionally, the magnetic force can cause the energy of the electrons to change. Electrons are influenced by electromagnetic forces, which can cause them to gain or lose energy. Therefore, the magnetic force can cause the energy of the electrons to change. So, the answer is both A and B.",
