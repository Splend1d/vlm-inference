Heavy-textured soil, such as silty clay. This type of soil requires more frequent irrigation to maintain optimal moisture levels for corn growth. A dispersed alluvial fan soil and a region of low humidity may not require as much irrigation. A light-textured soil, such as loamy sand, may require less irrigation than heavy-textured soil but still needs regular watering to support corn growth.",
