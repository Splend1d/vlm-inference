We want to find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls, so k can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nP(X = 0) = C(5, 0) \\* (1/6)^0 \\* (1-1/6)^(5-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(5, 1) \\* (1/6)^1 \\* (1-1/6)^(5-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) \\* (1/6)^2 \\* (1-1/6)^(5-2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(5, 0), C(5, 1), and C(5, 2):\n\nC(5, 0) = 1 (there's only one way to choose 0 rolls out of 5)\nC(5, 1) = 5 (there are 5 ways to choose 1 roll out of 5)\nC(5, 2) = 10 (there are 10 ways to choose 2 rolls out of 5)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) = 1 \\* (1/6)^0 \\* (1-1/6)^4\nP(X = 1) = 5 \\* (1/6)^1 \\* (1-1/6)^4\nP(X = 2) = 10 \\* (1/6)^2 \\* (1-1/6)^3\n\nNow, let's sum these probabilities to find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls:\n\nP(X = 0 \u222a X = 1 \u222a X = 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\n\nP(X = 0 \u222a X = 1 \u222a X = 2) = 1 \\* (1/6)^0 \\* (1-1/6)^4 + 5 \\* (1/6)^1 \\* (1-1/6)^4 + 10 \\* (1/6)^2 \\* (1-1/6)^3\n\nP(X = 0 \u222a X = 1 \u222a X = 2) \u2248 1.0436\n\nThe closest answer to this probability is option A: \\frac{125}{648}. So, the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls when rolling a fair 6-sided die 5 times is approximately 1 in 648.",
