Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state.\n\nassistant:The author of the passage principally bases his appeal on the argument that it is hypocritical to sell a substance that is banned in one's own country as harmful to another country. This is evident from the following lines: \"From their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men?\" and \"Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!\" The author is highlighting the inconsistency between the prohibition of opium in the writer's own country and its sale to other countries, particularly China. Therefore, the correct answer is A. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.",
