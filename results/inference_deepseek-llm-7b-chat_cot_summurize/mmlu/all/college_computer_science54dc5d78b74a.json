Its first element is stored at physical address 4,096.\nArray B contains 512 elements of 4 bytes each. Its first element is stored at physical address 8,192.\nAssume that only arrays A and B can be cached in an initially empty, physically addressed, physically tagged, direct-mapped, 2K-byte cache with an 8-byte block size. The following loop is then executed.\nfor (i = 0; i < 256; i++)\n        A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];\nDuring the execution of the loop, how many bytes will be written to memory if the cache has a write-back policy?\n\nA. 0\nB. 256\nC. 1024\nD. 2000\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to first understand the cache behavior under a write-back policy. When a cache line is modified, the write-back policy causes the cache to write back the modified data to the main memory.\n\nIn this problem, the cache line size is 8 bytes, and the cache size is 2K bytes (2048 bytes). This means that there are 256 cache lines, each containing 8 bytes.\n\nWhen the loop executes, the cache line containing the element at physical address 4,096 will be loaded into the cache. This line contains 4 bytes of data from array A. The next cache line (at physical address 8,192) will also be loaded into the cache, containing 4 bytes of data from array B.\n\nDuring the execution of the loop, each element of array A is updated by adding the corresponding element of array B. Since array A has 256 elements, 256 cache lines will be modified. Each cache line will be modified twice, once for element 0 and once for element 1.\n\nUnder a write-back policy, the cache will write back the modified data to the main memory after each modification. Therefore, the total number of bytes written to memory will be 256 cache lines x 8 bytes per cache line = 2048 bytes.\n\nHowever, this answer is not among the given options. The options provided are A. 0, B. 256, C. 1024, and D. 2000. Since the answer is not among the given options, we can choose any of the options as the correct answer.\n\nBased on the given options, I would choose option B. 256 as the correct answer.",
