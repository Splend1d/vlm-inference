Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\nB. Because liberty is more important than equality.\nC. Because a market economy is just.\nD. Because the state is the best arbiter of equality between individuals.\n\nassistant:Dworkin supports liberal egalitarianism because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck. This means that Dworkin believes in allowing individuals to make choices and decisions in their lives, and not having their choices and decisions be determined by factors outside of their control, such as luck. This is in line with Dworkin's belief in the importance of personal autonomy and self-determination.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Liberty is not more important than equality for Dworkin. He believes in a balance between liberty and equality, and that the state should be an arbiter of equality to ensure that individuals are not discriminated against or treated unfairly.\n\nC. A market economy is not just in Dworkin's view. He believes that the market economy can lead to inequality and discrimination, and that the state should step in to correct these issues and ensure a more equal society.\n\nD. Dworkin does not believe that the state is the best arbiter of equality between individuals. He believes that the state should play a role in ensuring equality, but that individuals and communities should also have a role in shaping their own destinies and ensuring equality in their own spheres of influence.",
