This is because, as stated in the question, \"Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver.\" This indicates that both friends did not intentionally target the victim, and they both acted in good faith. Therefore, they should not be held responsible for the injury caused.\n\nIf evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim, the jury should then be instructed to rule against the defendant who shot the spear that injured the victim. This is because, in this case, one of the defendants caused the injury, and they should be held responsible for it.",
