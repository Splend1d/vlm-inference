This act aimed to solidify the king's authority over the church, reinforce the authority of the monarchy, and to counteract the spread of Protestantism in England. The passage also mentions the purpose of increasing virtue in Christ's religion and repressing and extirpating errors and heresies within the church.\n\nTherefore, the Act can be inferred as an attempt to prevent the spread of Protestantism in England (option A). Additionally, the passage acknowledges the recognition of the king's authority by the clergy, which implies that the Act was not solely driven by financial difficulties (option B).\n\nThe passage also does not mention any specific issues related to Henry VIII's only heir or any attempt to legitimize him (option C). Furthermore, there is no indication that the Act aimed to ally England with the Holy Roman Emperor (option D).\n\nIn conclusion, based on the passage and its historical context, the Act of Supremacy, 1534, was primarily an attempt to prevent the spread of Protestantism in England (option A).",
