Assuming that feed costs are stable and there are no major death losses, which of the following is the most likely explanation for the difference in returns?\n\nA. Lower feed efficiency\nB. Poor record keeping\nC. Lower market prices\nD. Lower purchase prices\n\nassistant:To determine the most likely explanation for the difference in returns, let's consider the information given in the question:\n\n1. Average return last year: $151 for each $100 of feed\n2. Average return this year: $130 for each $100 of feed\n3. Assuming feed costs are stable and there are no major death losses\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Lower feed efficiency: This could potentially affect the return per $100 of feed, but it's not directly stated in the question.\n\nB. Poor record keeping: This seems unlikely, as the question assumes stable feed costs and no major death losses. Poor record keeping could lead to inaccurate return calculations, but it doesn't directly explain the difference in returns.\n\nC. Lower market prices: This could potentially explain the difference in returns, as lower market prices would lead to lower sales revenue.\n\nD. Lower purchase prices: This could potentially explain the difference in returns, as lower purchase prices would reduce the cost of feed, which would increase the return per $100 of feed.\n\nBased on the information given in the question, the most likely explanation for the difference in returns is a combination of lower market prices and lower purchase prices. This is because both factors would contribute to lower sales revenue, which in turn would lead to a lower average return per $100 of feed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{C + D}$",
