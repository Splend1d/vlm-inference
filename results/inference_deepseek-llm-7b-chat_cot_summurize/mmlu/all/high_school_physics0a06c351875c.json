The surface of the incline is extremely slick, so much so that the objects do not rotate when released, but rather slide with negligible friction. Which reaches the base of the incline first?\n\nA. the sphere\nB. the cube\nC. the cylinder\nD. All reach the base at the same time.\n\nassistant:Let's think about this step by step.\n\n1. The sphere rolls down the incline without slipping, so it has no rotational friction to slow it down.\n2. The cube, which is made of 6 rectangular faces, has 6 points of contact with the incline, which means it experiences more friction than the sphere.\n3. The cylinder has a round cross-section, so it rolls without slipping as well, like the sphere.\n\nSince the sphere experiences no rotational friction and has no contact points with the incline, it will reach the base of the incline first.\n\nSo the answer is A. the sphere.",
