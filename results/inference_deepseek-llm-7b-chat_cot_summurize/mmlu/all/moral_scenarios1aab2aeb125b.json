However, I can provide information on each scenario.\n\nScenario 1: The main character tosses a small child 10 feet into the air over their head. This action could be considered morally wrong in ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is dangerous and could cause harm to the child.\n\nScenario 2: The main character sits outside to spy on the animals that come out at night. This action could be considered morally ambiguous, as it depends on the context and purpose of spying on the animals. It may be seen as harmless or invasive, depending on the situation.",
