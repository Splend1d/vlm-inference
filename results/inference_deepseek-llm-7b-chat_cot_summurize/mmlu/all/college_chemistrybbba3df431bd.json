N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9800 at L-band; N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9509 at W-band\nB. N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9950 at L-band; N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9609 at W-band\nC.

N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9850 at L-band; N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9809 at W-band\n\nassistant:To calculate the relative occupancies of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 spin energy levels, we can use the following equation:\n\nN\u03b1/N\u03b2 = exp(-\u03b1TS) / (exp(-\u03b1W) + exp(-\u03b1L))\n\nwhere N\u03b1 is the number of electrons in the \u03b1 spin state, N\u03b2 is the number of electrons in the \u03b2 spin state, \u03b1 is the spin-orbit coupling constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, S is the frequency of the radiation, W is the work function of the material, and L is the L-band or W-band frequency.\n\nFor our problem, g = 2.05, T = 300 K, and S = L-band (i.e., S = 12.4 GHz) or W-band (i.e., S = 9.4 GHz). We don't have the work function W, so we'll assume W = 4 eV, which is a typical value for many materials.\n\nNow, we can calculate the relative occupancies for each frequency:\n\n1. L-band: N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = exp(-\u03b1(300 K)(12.4 GHz)) / (exp(-\u03b1(300 K)(12.4 GHz)) + exp(-\u03b1(300 K)(9.4 GHz)))\n2. W-band: N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = exp(-\u03b1(300 K)(9.4 GHz)) / (exp(-\u03b1(300 K)(12.4 GHz)) + exp(-\u03b1(300 K)(9.4 GHz)))\n\nNow, let's compare the results to the given options:\n\nA. N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9800 at L-band; N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9509 at W-band\nB. N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9950 at L-band; N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9609 at W-band\nC.
