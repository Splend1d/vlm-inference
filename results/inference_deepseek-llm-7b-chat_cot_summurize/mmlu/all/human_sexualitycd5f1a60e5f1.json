Menstruation is triggered by a sharp increase in estrogen levels.\n\nMenstruation is a natural process that occurs in women, and it is regulated by the fluctuations in hormone levels in the body. The menstrual cycle typically lasts for about 28 days, and it is divided into three phases: the follicular phase, the ovulation phase, and the luteal phase.\n\nDuring the follicular phase, which lasts for about 14 days, estrogen levels begin to rise. This stimulates the growth and development of the egg in the ovaries. As the follicle matures, it produces a hormone called LH (luteinizing hormone), which triggers ovulation.\n\nAfter ovulation, the follicle becomes the corpus luteum, which continues to produce progesterone and estrogen. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will eventually degenerate, leading to a sharp decrease in both estrogen and progesterone levels. This drop in hormone levels triggers the onset of menstruation, which lasts for about 5 days.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Menstruation is triggered by a sharp increase in estrogen levels.",
