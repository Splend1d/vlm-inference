Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\nB. prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\nC. not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\nD. not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.\n\nassistant:The plaintiff will likely not prevail in asserting a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort. Under the doctrine of strict liability, a defendant is held liable for harm caused by a defective product, regardless of whether the defendant owed a duty of care or was negligent. In this case, the plaintiff would need to show that the brackets were defective when the carpenter installed them. If the brackets were defective, the carpenter would likely be held liable for the injuries caused by the falling mirror. However, if the brackets were not defective when the carpenter installed them, the plaintiff would not be able to establish strict liability and would likely not prevail in the case.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the plaintiff may have a claim against the grocery store for failing to provide a reasonably safe environment for shoppers. If the grocery store knew or should have known that the large mirror was a potential hazard and failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate that hazard, they may be liable for the injuries caused by the falling mirror. However, this would be a separate claim from the one against the carpenter.",
