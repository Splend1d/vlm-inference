It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that are added to the individual's normal functioning, such as delusions and hallucinations.\n\nIn the question, we are looking for the positive symptom that is NOT part of schizophrenia. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B as they are both positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Option C, paranoid delusions, is also a positive symptom of schizophrenia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D, flat affect. Flat affect refers to a lack of emotional expression or a reduced range of emotional expression, which is not a part of schizophrenia.",
