This fallacy is often used to manipulate people's emotions and opinions, rather than to present valid arguments.\n\nOption A, B, and D do not describe the fallacy of appeal to indignation. Attacking the character or background of someone making an argument (Option A) is a form of ad hominem fallacy, not appeal to indignation. Responding to charges of wrongdoing by saying other people do the same thing (Option B) is a form of tu quoque fallacy, not appeal to indignation. Responding to an argument with an expression of derision instead of a counter argument (Option D) is a form of ad hominem fallacy, not appeal to indignation.",
