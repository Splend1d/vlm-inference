This is a characteristic of regions as it helps in understanding their spatial relationships.\n\nD. easily defined - While it is subjective to determine how easily a region can be defined, it is still considered a characteristic of regions as it relates to their definition and identification.\n\nBased on the analysis, all options A, B, C, and D can be considered characteristics of regions, except option D. Therefore, the answer is D. regions are easily defined.",
