Petabyte ( 2^50 or approximately 10^15 bytes)\n\nassistant:To calculate the total electronic storage required for the text in all the books of the university's libraries, we need to consider the number of words, letters/characters, bytes, and the storage unit.\n\n1. Calculate the number of words in a book: 3 million books * 400 pages/book * 50 lines/page * 10 words/line = 6 billion words.\n2. Calculate the number of letters/characters in a book: 6 billion words * 5 letters/character = 30 billion letters/characters.\n3. Calculate the total number of letters/characters in all the books: 30 billion letters/characters * 3 million books = 90 trillion letters/characters.\n4. Calculate the total number of bytes required for the text: 90 trillion letters/characters * 5 bytes/letter/character = 450 trillion bytes.\n\nNow, we can compare the given options with the calculated value:\n\nA. Megabyte (2^20 or approximately 10^6 bytes):\n450 trillion bytes / 10^6 bytes/Megabyte \u2248 450,000 Megabytes\n\nB.

Terabyte (2^40 or approximately 10^12 bytes):\n450 trillion bytes / 10^12 bytes/Terabyte \u2248 450 Terabytes\n\nD. Petabyte (2^50 or approximately 10^15 bytes):\n450 trillion bytes / 10^15 bytes/Petabyte \u2248 450 Petabytes\n\nBased on the calculations, the unit of electronic storage required for the text in all the books of the university's libraries is best measured in Petabytes (D). So, the answer is D. Petabyte.",
