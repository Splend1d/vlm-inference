Ti3+\nB. Cr3+\nC. Fe3+\nD. Zn2+\n\nassistant:B. Cr3+ cannot be used as a paramagnetic quencher.\n\nIn the context of metal ions in chemistry, paramagnetic refers to the behavior of an unpaired electron in an atom or molecule. This unpaired electron causes the overall atom or molecule to exhibit a magnetic moment, which can be influenced by an external magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, the metal ions A, C, and D (Ti3+, Fe3+, and Zn2+) all have at least one unpaired electron, which makes them paramagnetic. These metal ions can be used as paramagnetic quenchers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.\n\nOn the other hand, Cr3+ has a configuration of 3d5, which means that it has a full set of paired electrons in its 3d subshell and an unpaired electron in the 4d subshell. This electron configuration makes Cr3+ a high-spin ion, which is diamagnetic. Diamagnetic materials are weakly attracted to a magnetic field, while paramagnetic materials are weakly repelled by a magnetic field. Since Cr3+ is diamagnetic, it cannot act as a paramagnetic quencher in MRI studies.",
