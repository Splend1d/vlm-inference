For every aspect of development there is no overall change since each gain is offset by loss\nD. Gains are far more important than losses but losses occur too\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. We gain some things and lose others at every age.\n\nThe Lifespan Perspective is a theory of human development that emphasizes the importance of considering the entire lifespan of an individual, rather than just focusing on specific stages or periods of development. This perspective recognizes that development is a continuous process that involves both gains and losses at every stage of life.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that gains and losses are only experienced at different ages, whereas the Lifespan Perspective recognizes that these experiences occur throughout the lifespan.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it implies that there is no overall change in development, whereas the Lifespan Perspective recognizes that gains and losses can offset each other at different stages of life.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that gains are more important than losses, which contradicts the Lifespan Perspective's recognition of the importance of considering both gains and losses in development.",
