Then, we can find the standard deviation of the total cost by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of each category's standard deviation.\n\nFor books:\nStandard deviation = $\\sqrt{\\frac{350^2}{\\text{Population size}} + \\frac{65^2}{\\text{Population size}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{122500}{Population size} + \\frac{4225}{Population size}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{164725}{Population size} + \\frac{4225}{Population size}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{168949}{Population size}} = \\frac{660 \\sqrt{168949}}{Population size}$\n\nFor room and board:\nStandard deviation = $\\sqrt{\\frac{2800^2}{\\text{Population size}} + \\frac{380^2}{\\text{Population size}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{816000}{Population size} + \\frac{144400}{Population size}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{959800}{Population size} + \\frac{144400}{Population size}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1097120}{Population size}} = \\frac{555 \\sqrt{1097120}}{Population size}$\n\nFor personal expenditure:\nStandard deviation = $\\sqrt{\\frac{675^2}{\\text{Population size}} + \\frac{125^2}{\\text{Population size}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{476825}{Population size} + \\frac{15625}{Population size}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{492449}{Population size} + \\frac{15625}{Population size}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{508074}{Population size}} = \\frac{255 \\sqrt{508074}}{Population size}$\n\nNow, we find the standard deviation of the total cost by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of each category's standard deviation:\nTotal standard deviation = $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{660 \\sqrt{168949}}{Population size}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{555 \\sqrt{1097120}}{Population size}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{255 \\sqrt{508074}}{Population size}\\right)^2}$\n\n= $\\sqrt{\\frac{433842000}{Population size^2} + \\frac{564075000}{Population size^2} + \\frac{131327225}{Population size^2}}$\n\n= $\\sqrt{\\frac{1208989000}{Population size^2}}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt{1208989000}}{Population size}$\n\n= $\\frac{1719 \\sqrt",
