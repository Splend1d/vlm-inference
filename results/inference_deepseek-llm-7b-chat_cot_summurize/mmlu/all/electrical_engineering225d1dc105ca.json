An op-code fetch cycle: This is the first step in the execution of an instruction in an intel 8085A. During this cycle, the instruction is fetched from memory into the instruction register (IR).\n\nB. A memory read cycle: This cycle is part of the execution of an instruction, but it occurs after the op-code has been fetched. It involves reading data from memory.\n\nC. A memory write cycle: This cycle is also part of the execution of an instruction, but it occurs after the op-code has been fetched. It involves writing data to memory.\n\nD. An I/O read cycle: This cycle is not part of the first machine cycle of an instruction in an intel 8085A.\n\nBased on the analysis of the options, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
