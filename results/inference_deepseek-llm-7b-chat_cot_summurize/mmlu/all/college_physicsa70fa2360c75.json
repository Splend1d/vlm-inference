What is the total radiation force exerted on the surface?\n\nA. 2 x 10^-6 N\nB. 1 x 10^-5 N\nC. 2 x 10^-5 N\nD. 3 N\n\nassistant:The total radiation force exerted on the surface can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nF = (2 \\* sigma \\* A \\* sigma \\* G \\* I) / c^2\n\nwhere:\n- F is the radiation force\n- sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W/m^2/K^4)\n- A is the area of the surface (3 m^2)\n- G is the solar constant (1367 W/m^2)\n- I is the solar intensity (1000 W/m^2)\n- c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation, we get:\n\nF = (2 \\* 5.67 x 10^-8 \\* 3 \\* 1367 \\* 1000) / (3 \\* 10^8)^2\n\nF = (2 \\* 5.67 x 10^-8 \\* 3 \\* 1367 \\* 1000) / (9 \\* 10^8)\n\nF = (2 \\* 5.67 x 10^-8 \\* 1000 \\* 3 \\* 1367) / (9 \\* 10^8)\n\nF = 6 x 10^-7 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2 x 10^-6 N",
