This will secure the patent holder's right to a jury trial and initiate the litigation process. After the complaint is filed, the lawyer should serve the demand for a jury trial on the opposing party. This will ensure that the patent holder's right to a jury trial is properly preserved and will not be waived by the opposing party.",
