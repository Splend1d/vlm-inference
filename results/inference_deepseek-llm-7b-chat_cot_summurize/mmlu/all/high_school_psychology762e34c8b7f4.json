Their scores were: 42, 38, 14, 13, 12, 12, 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, 9, 9, 9. Which of the following statistics best reflects the central tendency of this data set?\n\nA. standard deviation\nB. correlation coefficient\nC. mode\nD. median\n\nassistant:To determine the best measure of central tendency for this data set, we need to consider which statistic best represents the \"typical\" or \"average\" value within the set.\n\nStatistic A. Standard deviation: This statistic measures the spread or dispersion of the data set. It tells us how much the data points vary from the mean. While it is useful to understand the spread of the data, it does not directly tell us what the \"typical\" or \"average\" value is.\n\nStatistic B. Correlation coefficient: This statistic measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It is not a measure of central tendency, but rather a measure of how two variables are related to each other.\n\nStatistic C. Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. In this case, the mode is 11, as this score appears three times. The mode gives us an idea of what the most frequent score is, but it does not necessarily represent the \"typical\" or \"average\" value.\n\nStatistic D. Median: The median is the middle value of a data set when it is arranged in order. If the data set has an odd number of values, the median is the value at the middle position. If the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle scores: 12 and 12. This means that half of the scores are above 12, and half are below 12. The median gives us a good indication of the \"typical\" or \"average\" value of the data set.\n\nTherefore, the best statistic to reflect the central tendency of this data set is the median.",
