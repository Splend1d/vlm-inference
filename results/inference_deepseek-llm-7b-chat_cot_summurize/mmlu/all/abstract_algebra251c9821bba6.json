Statement 2 | If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is field.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. This statement is true. In ring theory, a maximal ideal is an ideal that is not properly contained in any other ideal. It is also known as a maximal prime ideal or a prime ideal that is not a proper ideal. A prime ideal is an ideal that does not contain any non-zero divisors other than the null ideal. Therefore, every maximal ideal is also a prime ideal.\n\nStatement 2: If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is field. This statement is false. Even though maximal ideals are important in ring theory, the quotient ring R/I is not always a field. A quotient ring R/I is a field if and only if I is the zero ideal. In general, R/I is not a field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
