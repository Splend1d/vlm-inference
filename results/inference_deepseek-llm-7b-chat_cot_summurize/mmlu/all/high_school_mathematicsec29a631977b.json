What is the probability that they form a pair? (A 3-card hand is a 'pair' if two of the cards match in rank but the third card is different. For example, 668 is a pair, but 999 is not.)\n\nA. \\frac{1}{8}\nB. \\frac{1}{36}\nC. \\frac{1}{78}\nD. \\frac{72}{425}\n\nassistant:To find the probability of a pair, we first need to count the number of ways to choose 3 cards out of the 52 cards that form a pair. Then, we divide this count by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nA 3-card hand is a pair if and only if the first two cards have the same rank and the third card is different. So, there are 13 ranks for the first card, 13 ranks for the second card, and 1 rank for the third card. Therefore, there are 13 * 13 * 1 = 169 ways to form a pair.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes when choosing 3 cards out of 52. This is calculated as 52 choose 3, which is equal to 52! / (3! * (52 - 3)!) = 22100800 / (6 * 2197120) = 72.\n\nFinally, we divide the number of ways to form a pair (169) by the total number of possible outcomes (72) to find the probability of a pair: 169 / 72 = 2.406606 (approximately).\n\nSince the answer choices are fractions, we round this value to the nearest whole number. The answer is D. 72/425.",
