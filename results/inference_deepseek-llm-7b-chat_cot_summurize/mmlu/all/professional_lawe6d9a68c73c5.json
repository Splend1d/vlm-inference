No, the ordinance is void on its face.\n\nThis ordinance is likely unconstitutional because it allows the mayor to use his discretion in granting permits, which could potentially lead to arbitrary and discriminatory decisions. This type of ordinance is often found to be overbroad and violates the First Amendment rights of citizens. The other options are not correct because they either focus on the lack of a permit or the public nature of the park, rather than the constitutionality of the ordinance itself.",
