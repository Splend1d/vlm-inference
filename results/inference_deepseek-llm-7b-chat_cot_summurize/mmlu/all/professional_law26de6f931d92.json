Yes, because neighbor manifested his assent by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, at which point a contract existed.\n\nThe neighbor's action of tendering a bank check for the full sale price constitutes acceptance of the agreement's terms, which in turn creates a binding contract. The property owner's decision to return the money does not negate the fact that a contract existed previously. The property owner's defense that the neighbor did not sign the document is not relevant to the question of whether a contract was formed. The neighbor's assent to the agreement was manifested by his conduct of tendering the full sale price, which is sufficient to create a binding contract.",
