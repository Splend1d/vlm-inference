An hour later, his Dad wakes him to let him know it's time for dinner. Cyrus feels worse than when he went to bed and can hardly drag himself to the table.

Alpha waves are typically associated with a relaxed state of mind, while beta waves are associated with active, focused thinking. Delta waves, on the other hand, are associated with deep sleep and a state of rest. Since Cyrus was woken up from a nap, it's likely that his brain was in a state of deep sleep, which would produce a preponderance of delta waves in his EEG.",
