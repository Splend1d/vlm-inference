There is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that \u2211 a_i_k = 4.\n\nThis statement is false. If \u2211|a_i| diverges, then it is not possible to rearrange the terms of the series to make it convergent. Moreover, if \u2211 a_i = 2, it is not possible for the rearranged series \u2211 a_i_k to have a sum of 4.\n\nStatement 2: There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded.\u201d\n\nThis statement is true. It is a theorem in the theory of metric spaces that if X is a compact, closed, and bounded space, and Y is a metric space, then there exists a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is not closed and bounded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
