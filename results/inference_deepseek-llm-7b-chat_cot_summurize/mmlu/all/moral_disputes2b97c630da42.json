Her husband and parents were involved in a legal battle over the decision to remove the feeding tube, with the husband arguing that it was time for her to be allowed to die, and her parents arguing that her life should be preserved.\n\nPassive euthanasia is a form of euthanasia where a person's life is allowed to end by withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, such as a feeding tube or breathing machine. In contrast, active euthanasia is a form of euthanasia where a person's life is intentionally ended by some means, such as a lethal injection or a gunshot to the head.\n\nIn the case of Terri Schiavo, her feeding tube was removed, but her life was not intentionally ended. As a result, the decision to remove the feeding tube can be considered passive euthanasia.",
