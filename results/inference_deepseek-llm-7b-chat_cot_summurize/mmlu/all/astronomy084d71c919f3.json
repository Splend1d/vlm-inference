The luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.\n\nThe bolometric luminosity in astronomy is the total amount of energy emitted by an astronomical object over all wavelengths of light. It is calculated by integrating the luminosity (energy output) over all wavelengths of light, rather than just visible wavelengths.",
