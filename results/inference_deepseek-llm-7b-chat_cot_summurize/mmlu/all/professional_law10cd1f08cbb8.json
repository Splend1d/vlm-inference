After a violent tornado had ripped through the city, the electrical company was busily trying to restore electrical power to its customers. The morning after the storm, the repairman was perched on a ladder trying to repair a high-voltage power line. As he was removing the cover of the transformer box, the ladder suddenly slipped on the wet ground, even though it had been properly fixed into position. The repairman struggled to maintain his balance and, luckily, the ladder came to rest against the transformer box. A pedestrian, who was walking on the street below, saw the repairman's predicament and began to climb the ladder to aid him. As the pedestrian was ascending the ladder, his foot slipped, and he fell to the ground. His fall caused the ladder to jar loose the transformer box, which in turn sent the repairman falling to the pavement. The repairman and the pedestrian both suffered serious injuries. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the electrical company for his injuries, he will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because he was attempting to rescue the repairman.\nB. prevail, because a public utility company is strictly liable in tort.\nC. not prevail, because he was negligent in climbing the ladder.\nD. not prevail, because the repairman was not negligent in not affixing the ladder properly.\n\nassistant:B. prevail, because a public utility company is strictly liable in tort.\n\nIn this scenario, the pedestrian was attempting to assist the repairman in a situation where the electrical company was at risk of losing control of the power lines, which could have caused further damage to the city and its inhabitants. However, the ladder slipped and the pedestrian fell to the ground, causing the transformer box to be jarred loose and the repairman to fall. The pedestrian's actions were motivated by a genuine desire to assist, but unfortunately, the ladder was not properly secured, which led to the injuries suffered by both the repairman and the pedestrian.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a public utility company like the electrical company in this scenario is strictly liable in tort for any harm caused by its operations, including the maintenance of power lines and the repair of equipment. This means that the pedestrian's claim against the company for his injuries is likely to prevail, as the company is responsible for ensuring the safety of its operations and equipment. The fact that the pedestrian was attempting to rescue the repairman may be taken into consideration when determining the amount of compensation that the pedestrian is entitled to receive, but it will not necessarily affect the outcome of the case.",
