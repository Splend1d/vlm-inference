If Jennifer runs the first half of the race at 8 mph and the second half of the race at 6 mph, approximately how many hours does it take for her to complete the race?\n\nA. 2.62\nB. 3.74\nC. 3.82\nD. 4.12\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jennifer to complete the race by multiplying the distance she runs at each speed and then finding the total time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Jennifer to complete the first half of the race:\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nTime for first half = Distance / Speed\n\nSince the first half is 13.1 miles (13.1/2 = 6.55 miles/hour), the time for the first half is:\nTime for first half = 13.1 miles / 8 mph = 1.6375 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for Jennifer to complete the second half of the race:\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nTime for second half = Distance / Speed\n\nSince the second half is 13.1 miles (13.1/2 = 6.55 miles/hour), the time for the second half is:\nTime for second half = 13.1 miles / 6 mph = 2.1833 hours\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total time for Jennifer to complete the race:\nTotal time = Time for first half + Time for second half\nTotal time = 1.6375 hours + 2.1833 hours = 3.8208 hours\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an hour, we can round the result to the nearest whole number. The answer is:\n\nTotal time \u2248 3.82 hours\n\nThe closest option to the calculated answer is:\n\nC. 3.82",
