Let me explain each option:\n\nA. It did not decrease the need for immigrant labor. In fact, the growing economy and infrastructure development in the United States attracted many immigrants from Europe and elsewhere, who contributed to the workforce in various industries.\n\nB. It did stimulate the development of a market revolution. The transportation network allowed goods to be transported more efficiently, leading to increased trade and commerce, and the emergence of a more consumer-oriented market economy.\n\nC. It did not weaken the plantation system in the southern states. On the contrary, the transportation network helped to strengthen the plantation system by facilitating the movement of goods, including slaves, and increasing the profitability of cotton production.\n\nD. It did not transform the United States into an international military power. Although the country's economy and infrastructure were growing, the United States did not become a significant military power until after the Civil War, with the rise of the United States as a global superpower in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. It stimulated the development of a market revolution.",
