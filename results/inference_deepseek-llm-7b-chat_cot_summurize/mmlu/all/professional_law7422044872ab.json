Under the First Amendment, the community's standards for children may not be applied in determining what constitutes obscenity for adults. This is because the judge's instructions to the jury may have potentially violated the owner's First Amendment rights by considering the community standards from the perspective of children residing in the community. The other options do not necessarily address the main issue of the owner's First Amendment rights being violated.",
