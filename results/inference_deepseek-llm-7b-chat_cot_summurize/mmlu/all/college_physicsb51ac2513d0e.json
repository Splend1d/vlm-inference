At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\n\nA. 500 Hz\nB. 1,750 Hz\nC. 2,750 Hz\nD. 3,500 Hz\n\nassistant:To find the frequency at which the sound waves first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face, we can use the following formula:\n\nfrequency = v_initial / sqrt(1 - cos(q))\n\nwhere v_initial is the initial velocity of the sound waves, which is 350 m/s.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle q. Since the sound waves diffract out of the speaker enclosure as a rectangular slit, the angle q will be equal to the angle between the normal to the speaker face and the direction of the diffracted sound waves.\n\nThe normal to the speaker face is perpendicular to the rectangular slit, so the angle q is 90 degrees (or 2q) since the slit is perpendicular to the face.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nfrequency = 350 / sqrt(1 - cos(2q))\n\nfrequency = 350 / sqrt(1 - cos(4q))\n\nSince cos(2q) = cos(4q), the expression simplifies to:\n\nfrequency = 350 / sqrt(1 - cos(4q))\n\nSince we don't have the exact value of the angle q, we cannot provide an exact frequency. However, we can compare the given options to see which one is closest to the correct frequency.\n\nA. 500 Hz\nB. 1,750 Hz\nC. 2,750 Hz\nD. 3,500 Hz\n\nNone of the given options are close to the correct frequency.",
