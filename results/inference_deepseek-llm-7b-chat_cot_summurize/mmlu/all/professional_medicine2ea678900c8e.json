Physical examination reveals tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. The cause of this patient's condition is most likely a somatic dysfunction of which of the following muscles?\n\nA. anterior scalene\nB. latissimus dorsi\nC. pectoralis minor\nD. supraspinatus\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. supraspinatus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of pain at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity are consistent with a supraspinatus tendonopathy. The supraspinatus muscle is a rotator cuff muscle that helps to stabilize the shoulder joint. Tendinopathy, or inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon, is a common cause of shoulder pain and can result in pain with movement, especially abduction of the arm.",
