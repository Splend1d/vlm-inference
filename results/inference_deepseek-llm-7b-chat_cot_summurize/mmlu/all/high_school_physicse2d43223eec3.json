Using smaller plates\nB. Replacing the dielectric material between the plates with one that has a smaller dielectric constant\nC. Decreasing the voltage between the plates\nD. Moving the plates closer together\n\nassistant:B. Replacing the dielectric material between the plates with one that has a smaller dielectric constant\n\nExplanation: The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is determined by the distance between the plates, the area of the plates, and the dielectric constant of the material between the plates. Decreasing the dielectric constant of the material between the plates increases the capacitance because the same voltage will result in a larger charge on the plates, and thus a higher capacitance.",
