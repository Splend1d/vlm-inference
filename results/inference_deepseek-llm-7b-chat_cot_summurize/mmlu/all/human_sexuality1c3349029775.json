The feedback loop in men involves the hypothalamus, which produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones then act on the testes to regulate the production of sex hormones like testosterone. Oxytocin is not involved in this feedback loop.",
