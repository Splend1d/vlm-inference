Container 1 is filled with hydrogen and container 2 is filled with nitrogen. Each container is set on a lab table and allowed to come to thermal equilibrium with the room. Which of the following correctly compares the properties of the two gases?\n\nA. The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\nB. The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\nC. The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.\nD. The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.\n\nBoth hydrogen and nitrogen are gases at room temperature and pressure. When they reach thermal equilibrium, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules will be the same, regardless of whether they are hydrogen or nitrogen. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, the force exerted by the gas on the container is not a useful way to compare the properties of the two gases. The force exerted by a gas on a container depends on factors such as the pressure and the area of the container, and these factors can be different for different containers. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nFinally, the density of the gas can be affected by factors such as temperature and pressure, but it is not a good way to compare the properties of the two gases. The density of a gas is a property that depends on both the number of molecules and the volume, and these factors can be different for different gases. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nThe only correct answer is D. The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container. This is because the pressure of a gas is determined by the number of molecules and the volume, and these factors can be different for different gases.",
