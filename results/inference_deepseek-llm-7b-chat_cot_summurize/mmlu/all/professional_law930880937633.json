Carol, because the \"as is\" disclosure was not totally effective.\n\nassistant:The likely outcome of Carol bringing suit against the seller would be C. The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.\n\nIn this situation, Carol is not likely to win her case against the seller because she was aware that the car was being sold \"as is.\" The sales contract specified that the Thunderbird was used and sold as is, and Carol signed the contract indicating her agreement with these terms. Therefore, Carol cannot claim that the seller was negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Carol may have been misled by the seller's advertisement, which stated that the car was a 1964 model when it was actually a 1968 model. However, this would not be grounds for Carol to win her case against the seller, as the sales contract specified that the Thunderbird was used and sold as is.\n\nIn conclusion, the likely outcome of Carol bringing suit against the seller would be for the seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.",
