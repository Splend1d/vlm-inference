The car coasts up the incline without using the engine. Neglecting friction and air resistance, which of the following is correct about the magnitude of the car\u2019s horizontal acceleration ax and vertical acceleration ay?\n\nA. ax = 0; ay < g\nB. ax = 0; ay = g\nC. ax < g; ay < g\nD. ax < g; ay = g\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to use the following formulas:\n\n1. v = u + at (where u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time)\n2. s = ut + (1/2)at^2 (where s is the distance, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time)\n3. ay = (mgh) / (2*cos^2(\u03b8)) (where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, h is the height, and \u03b8 is the angle)\n\nFirst, let's find the final velocity vf:\nv = u + at\nu = 0 (since the car is initially at rest)\na = v (since the car is moving horizontally)\nt = s / v (since the distance covered is equal to the final velocity)\n\nv = 0 + (s / v) * v\nv = s\n\nNow, let's find the time t:\nt = s / v\n\nFinally, let's find the final velocity vf:\nv = s\n\nNow, let's find the vertical displacement h:\nh = s * cos(\u03b8)\n\nNow, let's find the initial velocity u:\nu = v - a * t\nu = s - (s / v) * a\nu = s * (1 - 1/v)\n\nNow, let's find the vertical acceleration ay:\nay = (mgh) / (2*cos^2(\u03b8))\n\nComparing the options:\n\nA. ax = 0; ay < g\nB. ax = 0; ay = g\nC. ax < g; ay < g\nD. ax < g; ay = g\n\nThe correct option is C. ax < g; ay < g.",
