The visitor asked, \"About how many students do you have here?\" and the Dean replied with a guess, \"Oh, I'd guess about one in a hundred.\" This is a denial of the antecedent because the visitor's original question was about the total number of students, but the Dean's response is about the student-to-building ratio.\n\nA. Equivocation is not applicable because the Dean's response is not confusing or ambiguous.\nB. Fallacy of Division is not applicable because the Dean is not dividing something (such as a pie or a population) and making an incorrect claim about the result.\nC. Appeal to Authority is not applicable because the Dean's response does not involve appealing to an authority or expert opinion.",
