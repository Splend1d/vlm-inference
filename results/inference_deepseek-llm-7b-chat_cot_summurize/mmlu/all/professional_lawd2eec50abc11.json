The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots.

The zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land, meaning that the investor's plan to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property can proceed despite the restrictions in the original deed. The residents of Phase I may not have standing to enjoin the construction of the shopping center, as they are not direct grantees of the original deed and may not have the same rights to enforce the restrictions as the original landowner and subsequent owners. Additionally, the covenant running with the land may not be as enforceable as the zoning ordinance, which is a legally established and enforceable document.",
