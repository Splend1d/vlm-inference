It was signed on March 3, 1918, between the Allied Powers and the Russian Republic, represented by the Bolshevik government led by Vladimir Lenin. The treaty marked the end of World War I for Russia and the beginning of a new era in the country's history.\n\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk can best be described as the result of the Bolsheviks' need to end the Russian war effort in order to consolidate their revolutionary gains. This was a crucial factor in their decision to negotiate and sign the treaty. The Bolsheviks had seized power in Russia in October 1917, and they were faced with the difficult task of balancing their revolutionary goals with the ongoing war effort. The treaty allowed the Bolsheviks to end the war and focus on consolidating their power, which was essential for their survival and the establishment of a new socialist regime.\n\nThe other options listed are not accurate descriptions of the treaty's origins. Bolshevik corruption and collaboration with Russian business interests are not mentioned in any of the treaty's articles, nor are they significant factors in understanding the treaty's context. The treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and the Russian Republic, and it did not involve French or British aid to the White Russians who opposed the Bolshevik government.\n\nIn conclusion, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was primarily a result of the Bolsheviks' need to end the Russian war effort and consolidate their revolutionary gains. This enabled them to focus on establishing a new socialist regime and implementing their vision for a revolutionary society.",
