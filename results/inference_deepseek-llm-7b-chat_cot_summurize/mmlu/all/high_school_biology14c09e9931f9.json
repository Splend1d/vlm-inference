While apoptosis does play a role in programmed cell death, it is not random. Instead, it is a tightly regulated process that is controlled by various internal and external signals. The other three statements accurately describe various factors that can trigger apoptosis, as well as its role in maintaining the health of an organism by eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells.",
