Carbohydrates are a crucial source of energy for the body, and a diet lacking in carbohydrates can result in insufficient energy for intense physical activities. The body relies on glycogen, a stored form of carbohydrate, as its primary energy source during exercise. When there is a low intake of carbohydrates, the body's glycogen stores become depleted more quickly, leaving the individual with less energy to perform high intensity exercises. Additionally, low carbohydrate intake can lead to a condition known as hypoglycemia, which can cause dizziness, weakness, and fatigue, further impairing exercise performance. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet with adequate carbohydrate intake for optimal exercise performance.",
