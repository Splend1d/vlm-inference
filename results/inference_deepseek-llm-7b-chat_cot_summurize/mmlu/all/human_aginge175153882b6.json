Positive reappraisal\nB. Lowering of aspirations\nC. Primary\nD. Internal\n\nassistant:Well-being for younger adults is positively related to form of control D. Internal.\n\nJustification:\n\nYounger adults who have a high level of internal control tend to have a higher sense of well-being. Internal control is the ability to perceive that one can influence and control their own life, including their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. This sense of control is associated with a higher level of well-being, as it allows individuals to cope better with stress and challenges.\n\nPositive reappraisal and lowering of aspirations are not directly related to well-being. Positive reappraisal is a cognitive process that involves reframing negative experiences in a positive light, while lowering of aspirations is a decision to set lower goals or expectations. Both of these processes can contribute to well-being, but they are not necessarily the form of control that is positively related to well-being for younger adults.\n\nPrimary control is not directly related to well-being. Primary control refers to the extent to which individuals feel that they have control over their environment and the events that occur within it. This form of control is more related to external factors, such as the ability to influence the behavior of others or the environment.",
