Upon signing the contract, the man made his first payment of $500 and attended the weekly class sessions. On the first day of the second month, the man once again made his $500 payment and continued to attend the session. At the start of the third month, the man told the director of the facility's accounting office that he was having financial difficulties, and asked for an extension.

One week later, the man received a letter from the facility informing him that he would be barred from attending any further classes unless the next $500 payment was made.

No, because by permitting the man to attend classes without having paid the third monthly installment, the facility waived its right to have that installment fee paid on time.\nB. No, because the facility's allowing the man to attend classes without paying the third monthly installment created an implied contract, thus permitting him to complete the classes without advance payment of the installments.\nC.

The correct answer is D. There was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which was a material part of the contract.\n\nThe man signed a contract with the facility agreeing to attend classes for six months and pay $500 on the first of each month. When the man failed to make the third monthly installment payment, this constituted an anticipatory breach of the contract. However, the facility's decision to permit the man to continue attending classes while he tried to get the money did not waive their right to have the installment fee paid on time. Additionally, the man's attendance at class sessions did not create an implied contract, as there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee. Therefore, the facility was justified in refusing to permit the man to attend classes.",
