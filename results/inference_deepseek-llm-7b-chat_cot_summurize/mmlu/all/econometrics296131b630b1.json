Unbiased and consistent\n\nOLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is a widely used method in statistics for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. When applied separately to each equation in a simultaneous system, the resulting estimates will be unbiased and consistent.\n\nUnbiased means that the estimated parameter is equal to the true parameter with a probability equal to one minus the probability of the parameter being outside the interval around zero.\n\nConsistent means that the estimated parameter converges to the true parameter as the sample size increases.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nB. Biased but consistent: OLS estimates are unbiased, so being biased and consistent is not possible.\n\nC. Biased and inconsistent: OLS estimates are unbiased, so being biased and inconsistent is not possible.\n\nD. It is impossible to apply OLS to equations that are part of a simultaneous system: This is not true. OLS can be applied to multiple equations simultaneously, but the results may be affected by the correlations between the variables in the equations.",
