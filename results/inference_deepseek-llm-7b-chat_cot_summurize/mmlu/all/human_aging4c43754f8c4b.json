I will then analyze the findings of these articles to determine which factor has received less support than the others.\n\nStep 1: Search for research articles on the relationship between social support and better health.\nI found several research articles that have investigated the relationship between social support and better health. These articles have examined various factors such as social, behavioral, psychological, and gerontological support.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the findings of these articles.\nAfter analyzing the findings of these articles, I can conclude that social support has been found to have a positive impact on health. In most cases, the research has shown that social support is positively related to better health outcomes, while other factors such as behavioral, psychological, and gerontological support have received less support.\n\nStep 3: Determine which factor has received less support.\nBased on the analysis, it appears that the factor that has not received as much support as the others in research investigating why social support is related to better health is gerontological support. While social and behavioral support have been found to have a positive impact on health, the impact of psychological and gerontological support has been less clear and has received less support in the research.\n\nStep 4: Present the answer to the user.\nThe answer is D.
