Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence.\n\nIn this context, managers are entrusted to run the company in the best interest of shareholders. Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of care and skill and diligence.\n\nThe duty of care and skill requires that the manager exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence in managing the company's affairs.

Stakeholder, Care and Skill, Diligence - The duty of care and skill requires that the manager exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence in managing the company's affairs, but it does not necessarily require that the manager act for the benefit of all stakeholders.\n\nC. Shareholders, Self-interest, Diligence - The duty of care and skill requires that the manager exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence in managing the company's affairs, but it does not require that the manager act in self-interest.\n\nD. Stakeholders, Care and Skill, Self-interest - The duty of care and skill requires that the manager exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence in managing the company's affairs, but it does not require that the manager act in self-interest or for the benefit of all stakeholders.",
