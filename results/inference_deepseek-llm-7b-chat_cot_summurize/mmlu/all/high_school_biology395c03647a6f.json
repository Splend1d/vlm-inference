Only animal life would continue to inhabit the region.\nB. Secondary succession would begin to occur.\nC. Only tough grasses would appear.\nD. The number of species would stabilize as the ecosystem matures.\n\nassistant:The most likely outcome in the case of a forest fire devastating the fir, birch, and white spruce trees would be the initiation of secondary succession. \n\nSecondary succession occurs after the primary succession has taken place, and the ecosystem has stabilized. In this case, after the initial forest fire, the area would undergo a period of disturbance, which would lead to the development of a new ecosystem. \n\nOption A is incorrect because in the case of secondary succession, a variety of plant and animal species would begin to inhabit the region, not just animal life. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the primary succession that occurs before secondary succession would result in the growth of tough grasses, not only tough grasses would appear. \n\nOption D is incorrect because after secondary succession, the number of species would stabilize as the ecosystem matures, not the number of species would stabilize as the ecosystem matures. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B, which states that secondary succession would begin to occur.",
