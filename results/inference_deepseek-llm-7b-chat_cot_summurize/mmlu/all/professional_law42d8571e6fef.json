Two years after the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement with the landlord, he subleases the house to his cousin. Thereafter, the cousin defaults on the rental payments. If the landlord brings an action to recover the past rent due from the cousin, the landlord will:\n\nA. recover, because pnvity of estate exists between a landlord and sublessee.\nB. recover, because there is privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.\nC. recover, because there is both privity of estate and privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.\nD. not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.\n\nUnder English law, privity of estate refers to the legal relationship between a landlord and a tenant. A tenant is bound by the lease they enter into with the landlord, and the landlord is entitled to receive rent from the tenant. However, privity of estate does not extend to a tenant's sublease of the property.\n\nTherefore, if the tenant subleases the property to his cousin, the landlord does not have privity of estate with the sublessee. As a result, the landlord cannot recover past rent due from the sublessee in an action for recovery.",
