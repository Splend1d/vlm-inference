Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates.\nD. Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade.\n\nassistant:Based on the passage, Al-Zawawi's report of Mansa Musa's statement about the only thing on which a duty is levied in his kingdom is the crude copper. This suggests that the main source of wealth in the kingdom of Mali during the time of Mansa Musa was the extraction and trade of copper, rather than any other commodity. Therefore, the wealth of Mali came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.\n\nMansa Musa also mentioned that he sends the copper ingots to another land, Sudan, and sells them for two-thirds of their weight in gold. This further indicates that copper was a significant source of wealth for Mali, and that the kingdom was able to trade and profit from its copper resources.\n\nFurthermore, the passage mentions that there are pagan nations in Mansa Musa's kingdom whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) from, but whom he employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. This suggests that the kingdom had a significant gold resource as well, which was also likely a major source of wealth for Mali.\n\nWhile the passage does not provide explicit information about the other options (conquest of pagan neighbors, large agricultural estates, or the slave trade), it is unlikely that any of these factors were the primary sources of Mali's wealth during the time of Mansa Musa. The passage focuses on the kingdom's copper and gold resources, and the lack of duties levied on goods in the kingdom suggests that these resources were the main drivers of Mali's wealth.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is A. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.",
