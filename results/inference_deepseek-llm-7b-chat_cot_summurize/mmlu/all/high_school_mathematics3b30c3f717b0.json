Let's find the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2y/dx\u00b2 = d\u00b2(ln x)/dx\u00b2 / dx\u00b2\nd\u00b2y/dx\u00b2 = 1 / x\u00b2\n\nNow, let's find where the second derivative is positive:\n\n1 / x\u00b2 > 0\nx\u00b2 > 0\nx > 0\n\nSince x > 0, there are no real values of x that make the second derivative positive. Therefore, there is no relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x.\n\nNow, let's consider the answer choices:\n\nA. 1\nB. e\nC. 2/e\nD. 1/e\n\nNone of these choices correspond to the relative maximum value of the function.",
