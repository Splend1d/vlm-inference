Calculate GDP for this economy if cheese retails for $3 a pound and 10 pounds are produced while crackers sell for $2 a pound and 20 pounds are produced.\n\nA. $35 \nB. $1,200 \nC. $70 \nD. $150\n\nassistant:To calculate the GDP in this economy, we need to find the total value of all the goods produced and then divide it by the number of people in the economy.\n\nFirst, let's find the total value of cheese produced:\n10 pounds of cheese * $3 per pound = $30\n\nNext, let's find the total value of crackers produced:\n20 pounds of crackers * $2 per pound = $40\n\nNow, let's add the total value of cheese and crackers:\n$30 (cheese) + $40 (crackers) = $70\n\nHowever, we need to find the GDP per person in this economy. To do that, we need to divide the total value of goods produced by the number of people in the economy. We don't know the population of the economy, so we can't determine the exact GDP per person.\n\nSince there is no option for \"I don't know\" or \"I need more information,\" we can choose the closest option to the calculated GDP:\n\nC. $70",
