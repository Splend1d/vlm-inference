Which number could be the actual population of Louisiana in 2010?\n\nA. 4,500,321\nB. 4,524,491\nC. 4,533,372\nD. 4,535,343\n\nassistant:To find the actual population of Louisiana in 2010, we can use the given information and rounding rule. Since the population is rounded to the nearest 10,000, we need to find the nearest multiple of 10,000 to the given population. \n\nThe given population is 4,530,000. We can find the nearest multiple of 10,000 by dividing the given population by 10,000 and rounding up or down to the nearest whole number:\n\n4,530,000 / 10,000 = 453\n\nSince 453 is less than 454, we round down to 453. Therefore, the nearest multiple of 10,000 to 4,530,000 is 4,530,000. The actual population of Louisiana in 2010 could be any of the numbers that are multiples of 10,000 up to but not including 4,530,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4,535,343",
