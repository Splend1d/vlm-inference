Pension\nB. Social security\nC. Savings\nD. Assets\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first analyze the information provided by the user and then provide the appropriate answer based on the context.\n\n1. The user is asking about a three-legged stool, which is a metaphor for financial security during retirement.\n2. The user is interested in which of the three legs (options A, B, C, and D) is most commonly experienced by retirees.\n\nNow, I will examine each option:\n\nA. Pension: A pension is a regular income received by retirees after they have completed their employment. Many people rely on pensions as part of their retirement income.\n\nB. Social security: Social security is a government-run program that provides financial assistance to retirees. It is typically combined with other sources of income for a complete retirement income.\n\nC. Savings: Savings refer to the money that a person has accumulated over time for their retirement. Some retirees rely solely on their savings, but it is not as common as pensions or social security.\n\nD. Assets: Assets refer to any financial resources, such as real estate, investments, or savings accounts, that a retiree may have. While assets can provide financial security during retirement, they are not typically considered a \"leg\" of the three-legged stool, as they are not a guaranteed source of income.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most commonly experienced \"leg\" of the three-legged stool among retirees is pension. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. Pension",
