The average total energy of the oscillator is\n\nA. (1/2) k T\nB. kT\nC. (3/2) k T\nD. 3kT\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, we can use the equipartition theorem, which states that the average kinetic energy of a particle in a harmonic oscillator is 3/2 of its temperature in Joules.\n\nk is the spring constant of the oscillator, which we assume is equal to 1 N/m.\n\nT is the temperature of the reservoir in Kelvin.\n\nNow let's calculate the average total energy of the oscillator:\n\nE_k = (3/2) k T\nE_total = E_k + E_pot = (3/2) k T + (1/2) k^2 x\n\nwhere E_pot is the potential energy of the oscillator.\n\nSince the oscillator is in thermal equilibrium with the temperature reservoir, the average total energy of the oscillator is equal to the temperature multiplied by the Boltzmann constant, which is kT.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. kT",
