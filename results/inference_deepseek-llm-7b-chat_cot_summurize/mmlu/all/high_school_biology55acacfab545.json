Which of the following statements states the immediate source of that energy?\n\nA. Electrons flow down an electron transport chain as they are attracted to oxygen.\nB. The transfer of a phosphate group to ADP is exergonic.\nC. The bonding of electrons to oxygen at the end of the chain releases energy.\nD. The proton gradient across the membrane where the ATP synthase is embedded represents potential energy.\n\nassistant:The immediate source of the energy needed to drive ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation is the proton gradient across the membrane where the ATP synthase is embedded. Therefore, the correct answer is D. The bonding of electrons to oxygen at the end of the chain releases energy.",
