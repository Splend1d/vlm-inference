For a binary solvent system, the mole fraction x can be calculated using the mole ratio between the solute and solvent.\n\nFor lead iodide, the mole ratio between lead and iodine is 1:2, so the mole fraction of lead (x) is x = 1/3.\n\nThe solubility of lead iodide in water at 25\u00b0C is given by the equation:\n\nK_sp * x^2 = 1.0 mmol / 1.0 L\n\nSolving for K_sp, we get:\n\nK_sp = (1.0 mmol / (1.0 L * (1/3)^2))\nK_sp = (1.0 mmol / (1.0 L * (1/9)))\nK_sp = (1.0 mmol / 0.111 L)\nK_sp = 9.09 mmol^2/L\n\nThe solubility product for lead iodide at 25\u00b0C is 9.09 mmol^2/L, which is approximately 9.09 \u00d7 10^\u22129 mol^2/L^2. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 4.0 \u00d7 10^\u22129.",
