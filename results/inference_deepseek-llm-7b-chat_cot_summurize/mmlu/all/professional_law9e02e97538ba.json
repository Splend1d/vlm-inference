The purpose of these rules is to assist the agency in attaining the clean water standards required by the statute. After the agency issued such rules, several states filed an action challenging the rules on the sole ground that they are unconstitutional. Should the court uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules?\n\nA. No, because the federal government may not compel a state legislature to enact into state law a federally mandated regulatory program.\nB. No, because the Tenth Amendment grants states immunity from all direct federal states immunity from all direct federal regulation.\nC. Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\nD. Yes, because the supremacy clause of Article VI requires states to enforce federal law.\n\nassistant:The court should uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules. The correct answer is C. Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" This amendment is often referred to as the \"states' rights\" amendment, and it is intended to limit the power of the federal government and protect the sovereignty of the states.\n\nIn this case, the federal statute authorizes a federal agency to issue rules requiring that state legislatures adopt laws of limited duration to reduce water pollution from gasoline-powered boat motors. The rules are designed to assist the agency in attaining the clean water standards required by the statute. The question is whether the rules are constitutional, and whether the court should uphold them.\n\nThe correct answer is C, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments. The rules are designed to protect the environment and public health, and they are temporary in nature, which means that they will not have a significant impact on the states' ability to govern themselves.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because the federal government may not compel a state legislature to enact into state law a federally mandated regulatory program. This answer is incorrect because the rules are not a mandate, but rather a requirement for states to adopt laws of limited duration to reduce water pollution.\n\nB. No, because the Tenth Amendment grants states immunity from all direct federal regulation. This answer is incorrect because the Tenth Amendment does not grant states immunity from federal regulation. Rather, it limits the power of the federal government and protects the sovereignty of the states.\n\nD. Yes, because the supremacy clause of Article VI requires states to enforce federal law. This answer is incorrect because the supremacy clause of Article VI does not require states to enforce federal law. Rather, it establishes that the Constitution, and federal law enacted pursuant to the Constitution, is the supreme law of the land.",
