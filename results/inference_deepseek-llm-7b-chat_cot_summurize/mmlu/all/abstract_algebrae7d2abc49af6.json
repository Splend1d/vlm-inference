If a polynomial has a linear factor x - a (where a is an integer), then the polynomial can be factored as (x - a)(x - b)(x - c), where b and c are the other roots of the linear factor.\n2. If a polynomial has a linear factor x + a (where a is an integer), then the polynomial can be factored as (x + a)(x + b)(x + c), where b and c are the other roots of the linear factor.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 in Z_7[x].\n\n1. The coefficient of x^3 is 1, the coefficient of x^2 is 2, and the coefficient of x is 2. We can look for a linear factor x - a in Z_7[x] such that the constant terms of the linear factor and the polynomial are congruent.\n\nWe can check each of the 7 possible linear factors (x - 1, x - 2, x - 3, x - 4, x - 5, x - 6, x - 7) to see if they satisfy the condition.\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 (mod 7) = 0\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 (mod 7) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1\n\nNone of the possible linear factors satisfy the condition, so there is no linear factor x - a in Z_7[x] that will allow us to factor x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\n2. Since there is no linear factor x - a in Z_7[x] that will allow us to factor x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1, we will try to factor the polynomial using a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 in Z_7[x]. We can rewrite it as x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 + x + 1 + 1 = (x^3 + x^2 + 1 + 1 + x^2 + x + 1) + 2x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\nNow, let's factor the left-hand side of the equation using the rule for factoring x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d in Z_7[x]: (x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) can be factored as (x - a)(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d), where a, b, c are integers such that a^2 + ac + b = 0 (mod 7).\n\nIn our case, b = 2, c = 2, and d = 1. We can solve the equation a^2 + ac + b = 0 (mod 7) for a:\n\na^2 + ac + 2 = 0 (mod 7)\n\na^2 + ac + 2 = 0\n\na(a + c) + 2(a + c) = 0\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod 7)\n\na(a + c) = -2(a + c) (mod ",
