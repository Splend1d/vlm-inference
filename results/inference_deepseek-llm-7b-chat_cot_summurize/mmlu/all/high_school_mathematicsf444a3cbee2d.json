We can represent this as:\n\n$10 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{3^5} = \\frac{10}{243}$\n\nTherefore, the single fraction that gives the same result as multiplying 10 by $\\frac{1}{3}$ five times is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{243}}$.",
