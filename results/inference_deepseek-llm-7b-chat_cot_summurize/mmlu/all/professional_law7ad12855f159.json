In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the sculptor entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the sculptor a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property.

The sculptor and his family have not used the cottage for 11 years because of his employment commitment in Europe.

Upon the sculptor's return from Europe, he goes to his lakefront cottage and discovers the obstructing ramp. The sculptor initiates suit against the neighbor to compel him to remove the ramp.

This agreement was valid, and the sculptor was entitled to use the roadway as long as he did not abandon the easement. The sculptor's absence for 11 years would not constitute an abandonment of the easement, as he had not formally given up his right to use the roadway.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the sculptor's absence for 11 years does not necessarily mean he has abandoned the easement.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the sculptor's non-use of the roadway does not necessarily mean he has failed to notify the neighbor of the non-use.\n\nOption C is incorrect because mere non-use, however long continued, will not as a rule effectuate an abandonment.\n\nTherefore, the court would most likely hold in the sculptor's favor, based on the validity of the agreement for the express grant of the easement.",
