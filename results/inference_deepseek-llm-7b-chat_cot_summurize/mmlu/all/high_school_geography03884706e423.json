Eastern and Southern Europeans, such as Italians, Greeks, and Jews, were also present, but they were not the dominant group during this period. In contrast, Asian immigration to the United States began to grow significantly during the 1870s, and by the early 20th century, it had become a significant force in the U.S. population. Hispanic immigration began to grow in the 1960s, and it has since become a major part of the U.S. population.",
