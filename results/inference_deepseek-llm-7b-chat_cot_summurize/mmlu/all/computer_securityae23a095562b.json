Integrity\nB. Privacy\nC. Nonrepudiation\nD. Both A & C\n\nassistant:The AH Protocol provides source authentication and data integrity, but not privacy.\n\nThe AH Protocol is a protocol that is used to provide source authentication and data integrity in a network. Source authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a source of data, while data integrity is the process of ensuring that data has not been tampered with during transmission.\n\nHowever, the AH Protocol does not provide privacy. Privacy refers to the protection of data from unauthorized access or disclosure. While the AH Protocol can help ensure the authenticity and integrity of data, it does not provide any protection for the privacy of the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Privacy.",
