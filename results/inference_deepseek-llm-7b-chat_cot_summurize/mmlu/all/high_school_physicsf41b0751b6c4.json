Equal to the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gain in kinetic energy compensates for the mechanical energy lost to thermal energy on the rough incline.\n\nThe correct answer is B. The object's kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the block's gravitational potential energy when it was released. This is because the gain in kinetic energy compensates for the mechanical energy lost to thermal energy on the rough incline.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the conservation of mechanical energy does not apply in this case, as some mechanical energy is lost to thermal energy on the incline.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the gravitational potential energy is not necessarily less than the kinetic energy. The gain in kinetic energy compensates for the mechanical energy lost to thermal energy on the rough incline.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the work done by the friction force is not necessarily greater than the gain in kinetic energy. The friction force may be less than the work done if the incline is rough.",
