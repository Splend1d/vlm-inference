The store was responsible for maintaining a safe environment for its invitees, which the driver was at the time of the accident. The fact that the driver entered the store for the purpose of obtaining change for a parking meter does not change the store's obligation to provide a safe environment, as it was foreseeable that the driver may need assistance with this task.\n\nUnder the relevant laws, the store had an obligation to inspect its premises and discover dangerous conditions that might harm its invitees. The store's failure to do so and the resulting injury to the driver can be considered negligence on the part of the store. This negligence can be proven by the driver, who will most likely recover damages for the injuries sustained in the accident.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. the driver will most likely recover, because the store was negligent in failing to inspect its premises and discover dangerous conditions that might harm its invitees.",
