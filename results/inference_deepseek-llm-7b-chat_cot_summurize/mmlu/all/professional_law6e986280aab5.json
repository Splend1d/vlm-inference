Seek judgment as a matter of law, because the jury\u00d5s findings were clearly erroneous.\n\nassistant:The protester's best option for challenging the judgment would be to seek a new trial because the jury instruction affected the protester's substantial rights. This is because the court instructed the jury with the wrong burden of proof, which could have biased the outcome of the trial. The protester could also argue that the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence, which would be a valid reason for seeking a new trial as well. However, seeking judgment as a matter of law because the jury did not have legally sufficient evidence to find for the officer or because the jury's findings were clearly erroneous would not be a valid option in this case, as these reasons would not apply given the incorrect jury instruction.",
