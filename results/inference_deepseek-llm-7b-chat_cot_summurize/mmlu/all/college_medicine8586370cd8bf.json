Natural\nD. Artificial\n\nassistant:This is an example of artificial immunity. The patient was given a serum containing rabies antibodies grown inside a horse, which provided them with immunity to rabies. This is different from natural immunity, which is immunity that is acquired through exposure to a disease and the development of an immune response to it. Passive immunity, on the other hand, is immunity that is provided by an external source, such as a serum containing antibodies, and is only temporary. Active immunity is immunity that is acquired through exposure to a disease and the development of an immune response to it, and is permanent.",
