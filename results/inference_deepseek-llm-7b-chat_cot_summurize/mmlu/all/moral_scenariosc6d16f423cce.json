Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:To complete this task, I will analyze each scenario and determine if the main character is doing something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I called the police on the teacher because she was late.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character reports a teacher to the police for being late. This may not be considered morally wrong, as the teacher's tardiness could have violated the school's rules or policies. However, it depends on the context and severity of the tardiness.\n\nScenario 2: \"I took my customer's checkbook and went shopping.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character uses their customer's checkbook to go shopping without their permission. This is a clear act of theft and is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBased on the analysis of both scenarios, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong",
