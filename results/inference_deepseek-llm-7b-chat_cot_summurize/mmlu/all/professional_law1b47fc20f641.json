The Court ruled that while the student's speech was offensive, the First Amendment still protected his right to express his opinion, even if it was in a vulgar manner. The Court emphasized that the school had to strike a balance between protecting the rights of the student and maintaining an environment that was conducive to learning. The Court also noted that the student's actions did not rise to the level of a serious disruption that would warrant limiting his speech. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{B}.}$",
