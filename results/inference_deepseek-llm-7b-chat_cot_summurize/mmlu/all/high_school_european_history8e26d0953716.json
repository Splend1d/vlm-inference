He left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants.\nD. He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him.\n\nassistant:The greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV, as described in the text, is his obsession with appearances and his tendency to punish those who did not meet his high standards of attendance at Court. This led to a fear among the courtiers and a lack of trust in him as a leader.\n\nAlthough Louis XIV did value splendor and magnificence, his excessive focus on appearances and his insistence on perfect obedience from his courtiers could have had negative consequences for his rule. The fear of incurring his displeasure could have led to a lack of loyalty and trust among the courtiers, and it could have hindered open and honest communication between the king and his subjects.\n\nOption B, which suggests that he was concerned with ceremonies and appearances to the detriment of ruling his country well, seems to be the most accurate answer. This focus on appearances could have led to a lack of trust and loyalty among his subjects, and may have contributed to his eventual downfall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.",
