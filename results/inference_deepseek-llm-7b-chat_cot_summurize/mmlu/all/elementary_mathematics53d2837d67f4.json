The shorter base of the trapezoid is 130 yards long and the longer base is 390 yards long. The distance between the two bases is 75 yards. What is the area of the field?\n\nA. 9,750 yards^2\nB. 19,500 yards^2\nC. 29,250 yards^2\nD. 39,000 yards^2\n\nassistant:To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel bases) * (height)\n\nIn this case, the shorter base is 130 yards, the longer base is 390 yards, and the distance between the bases is 75 yards. The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the bases.\n\nLet's first find the height using the Pythagorean theorem. The shorter base is the base of the right triangle, and the longer base is one of the legs. The distance between the bases is the hypotenuse.\n\nLet h be the height of the trapezoid.\n\n(130)^2 + (390-h)^2 = (75)^2\n\n16900 + (390^2 - 2(390)(h) + h^2) = 5625\n\n390^2 - 7800 + 2(390)(h) - h^2 = 0\n\nNow, let's find the height h. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nh = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = -7800, and c = -390^2 + 4(1)(390)(h) = -390^2 + 15600\n\nh = (-(-7800) \u00b1 \u221a((-7800)^2 - 4(1)(-390^2 + 15600))) / 2(1)\n\nh = (7800 \u00b1 \u221a(58320000 - 15600)) / 2\n\nh = (7800 \u00b1 \u221a(58164000) / 2)\n\nh = (7800 \u00b1 2900) / 2\n\nh = 4900 / 2 or h = 1400 / 2\n\nh = 4900 or h = 700\n\nSince h cannot be negative, we take the smaller value of the height, which is 700 yards.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the trapezoid:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (130 + 390) * 700\n\nArea = (1/2) * 520 * 700\n\nArea = 260000 / 2\n\nArea = 130000 yards^2\n\nTherefore, the area of the field is 130,000 square yards, which corresponds to option D.",
