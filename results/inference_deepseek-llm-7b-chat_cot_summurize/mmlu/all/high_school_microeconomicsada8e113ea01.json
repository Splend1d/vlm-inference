P = MR = MC > ATC.\n\nA monopoly firm is one that has no close competitors in its market. This allows the firm to set the price of its product or service at a level that is higher than the minimum price needed to cover its costs, resulting in a profit for the firm. The profit margin (P/MR) and cost of production (MC) are both equal to the price of the product or service (P), which is higher than the average total cost (ATC) of producing the same good or service. Therefore, the profit margin (P/MR) is greater than the average total cost (ATC).",
