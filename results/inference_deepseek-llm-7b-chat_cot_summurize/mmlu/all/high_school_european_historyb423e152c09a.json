This council saw the Byzantines asserting the superiority of Plato over Aristotle, an argument that was further fueled by the increasing contact with Byzantine scholarship. The humanists of the time, including the Medici family, were also drawn to the study of ancient philosophy, particularly that of Plato. However, they were unable to produce any substantial work due to their preoccupation with acquiring knowledge of antiquity. This situation can be seen as an acceleration of the rediscovery of classical philosophy in Western Europe, which ultimately paved the way for the substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle.",
