What will happen to the mean?\n\nA. It will remain the same.\nB. It will increase by 4 points.\nC. It will increase by 10 points.\nD. It will increase by 40 points.\n\nassistant:The mean of a set of numbers is equal to the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. If we increase the largest score by 40 points, it will increase the sum by 40 points and the count by 1. The difference between the new sum and the old sum is 100 points (40 points * 2), and the old count is 10. So, the new mean is (old sum + 100) / old count = (10 * old mean + 100) / 10. Since the old mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the count, the new mean is 10 * old mean + 100 / 10 = old mean + 10. Therefore, the mean will increase by 10 points.\n\nThe answer is C. It will increase by 10 points.",
