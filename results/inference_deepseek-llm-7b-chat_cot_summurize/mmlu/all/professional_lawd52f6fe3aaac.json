It maybe proved to impeach him as a witness.\n\nThe witness's mental illness may affect his perception of reality, and thus, it could be used to impeach him as a witness. This means that his testimony could be challenged and discredited based on his mental condition. The other options are incorrect: A. The mental illness does not disqualify him from testifying, as he is still able to provide testimony. C. The mental illness may affect his competence and credibility as a witness, making his testimony less reliable. D. The mental illness is not automatically unfairly prejudicial, but it could be used to challenge his testimony in court.",
