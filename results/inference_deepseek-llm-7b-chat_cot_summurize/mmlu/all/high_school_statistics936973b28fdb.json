Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?\n\nA. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.\nB. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.\nC. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.\nD. No, because the entire population information was used from both offices.
