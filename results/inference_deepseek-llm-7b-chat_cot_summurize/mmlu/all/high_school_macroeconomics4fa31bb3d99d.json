This will decrease the money supply as the central bank is reducing the amount of bonds in circulation. As a result, aggregate demand will also decrease, leading to lower inflation. Unemployment may increase in the short term due to the monetary policy, but over time, as the economy adjusts, it will lead to full employment.",
