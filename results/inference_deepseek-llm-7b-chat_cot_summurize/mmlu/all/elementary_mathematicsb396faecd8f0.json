She has 5 times as many marbles as Joe has. How many marbles does Joe have?\n\nA. 50\nB. 40\nC. 9\nD. 5\n\nassistant:Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. Let the number of marbles Joe has be J.\n2. According to the problem, Dani has 5 times as many marbles as Joe, so we can write the equation:\n   J = 5 * (number of marbles Dani has)\n   J = 5 * 45\n   J = 225\n\n3. So, Joe has 225 marbles.\n\nNow, let's compare the answer with the given options:\n\nA. 50\nB. 40\nC. 9\nD. 5\n\nThe closest option to 225 is option B (40), so the answer is B.",
