What is the value of f(2)?\n\nA. 1/(2e)\nB. 1/e\nC. e^2/2\nD. 2e\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to first find the solution y = f(x) of the given differential equation. The given differential equation is:\n\nx dy + (y - xe^x) dx = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\ndy + (xe^x) dx = 0\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n\u222b dy = \u222b (xe^x dx)\n\ny = x^2e^x + C\n\nNow, we are given that y = 0 when x = 1:\n\n0 = 1^2e^1 + C\n\nC = 0\n\nSo, the solution y = f(x) is:\n\ny = x^2e^x\n\nNow, we are asked to find the value of f(2). We substitute x = 2 into the function y = x^2e^x:\n\nf(2) = (2)^2e^2\n\nf(2) = 4e^2\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 2e.",
