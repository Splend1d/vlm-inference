Explain to the client that the request will most likely cause the auditor to disclaim an opinion.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Request the client's management to document the matter in the management representation letter.\n\nIn this situation, if the auditor has a valid reason for not confirming the account receivable, they should request that the client's management document the matter in the management representation letter. This letter should explain the circumstances surrounding the non-confirmation and provide assurance that the client has taken appropriate steps to address the issue.\n\nOption A is not necessarily the best course of action, as the auditor may not have access to the client's bank statements and cash receipt records. Option B is not a viable solution, as selecting a different account for confirmation that is approximately the same size is not a sufficient substitute for confirming the original account receivable. Option D is not an appropriate response, as the auditor should not be afraid to explain the implications of the client's request to disclaim an opinion.",
