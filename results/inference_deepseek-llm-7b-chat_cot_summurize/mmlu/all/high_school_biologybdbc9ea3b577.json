I. Active transport II. Selective permeability III. Differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane\n\nA. III only\nB. I and II only\nC. II and III only\nD. I, II, and III\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's examine each of the given options and see which one is related to the resting membrane potential.\n\nOption I: Active transport refers to the movement of ions across the membrane against their concentration gradient, driven by energy. This process is not directly related to the resting membrane potential.\n\nOption II: Selective permeability refers to the ability of the membrane to selectively allow ions to pass through, based on their size and charge. This is a key factor in determining the resting membrane potential, as it allows specific ions to flow into the cell, causing the membrane potential to be negative.\n\nOption III: Differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane refers to the uneven distribution of ions across the membrane. This affects the resting membrane potential, as ions with a higher concentration inside the cell will diffuse out and cause the membrane potential to become more negative.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C (II and III only) is the correct answer. The resting membrane potential depends on selective permeability and the differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane.",
