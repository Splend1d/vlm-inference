Singer argues that these corporations knowingly support and enable corrupt regimes, which often result in human rights abuses and the deaths of innocent people. In this analogy, the international corporations are likened to murderers because they actively participate in the perpetuation of these abuses, despite the potential negative consequences.\n\nB. prostitutes who knowingly spread disease.\n\nSinger does not use this analogy in his argument.\n\nC. people who knowingly buy stolen goods.\n\nSinger does not use this analogy in his argument.\n\nD. all of the above.\n\nBased on the analogy used by Singer, the closest analogy to the international corporations dealing with corrupt dictators is option A: murderers of those who witness crimes.
