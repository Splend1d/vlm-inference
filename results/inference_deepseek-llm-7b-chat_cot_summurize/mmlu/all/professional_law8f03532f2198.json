Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\n\nIn this case, the state court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, stating that the action was dismissed with prejudice. This means that the plaintiff was unable to prosecute the action further in that court. Since a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits, the federal court should give preclusive effect to the state court judgment. The defense of res judicata (claim preclusion) allows a court to refuse to hear a claim that has already been decided in a previous legal proceeding. In this case, the federal court should recognize the state court's judgment and dismiss the plaintiff's claim, as it would be repetitive and futile to allow the plaintiff to re-litigate the same claim.",
