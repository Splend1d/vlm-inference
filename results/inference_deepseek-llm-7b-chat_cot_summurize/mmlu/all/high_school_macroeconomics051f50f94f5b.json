The government increases spending matched with an increase in taxes.\nD. The government increases taxes and decreases spending.\n\nassistant:The most effective fiscal policy when the economy is experiencing an inflationary gap is likely to be option C: The government increases spending matched with an increase in taxes.\n\nDuring an inflationary gap, the economy is experiencing a higher rate of inflation than its potential growth rate. This can lead to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in prices. One way for a government to combat inflation is by implementing a contractionary fiscal policy, which aims to reduce the money supply and decrease the rate of inflation.\n\nOption A, where the government decreases taxes and keeps spending unchanged, could potentially increase demand for goods and services, leading to higher prices and further inflation. Option B, where the government increases spending and keeps taxes unchanged, could also increase demand for goods and services, leading to higher prices and further inflation. Option D, where the government increases taxes and decreases spending, could reduce demand for goods and services, leading to lower prices and potential deflation, but it may not be as effective as an increase in taxes combined with an increase in spending, as suggested by option C.\n\nTherefore, the most effective fiscal policy when the economy is experiencing an inflationary gap is likely to be option C: The government increases spending matched with an increase in taxes.",
