Vitamin C\nB. Folate\nC. Vitamin B12\nD. Calcium\n\nassistant:C. Vitamin B12\n\nInfants born to vegan mothers are at risk of deficiency in vitamin B12, as it is primarily found in animal products. The human body does not produce vitamin B12, and it is essential for proper brain development and function. While some vegan sources of vitamin B12 do exist, such as fortified foods and nutritional yeast, these sources are often less bioavailable and less effective than animal sources.\n\nTherefore, it is important for vegan mothers to ensure they are consuming enough vitamin B12-rich foods or taking a supplement to prevent deficiency in their infants.\n\nA. Vitamin C: Although important, vitamin C deficiency is not typically a concern for vegans, as it can be found in a variety of plant-based sources such as citrus fruits, berries, and vegetables.\n\nB. Folate: Vegans can obtain folate from a variety of plant-based sources such as leafy greens, legumes, and fortified foods. Folate is essential for healthy fetal development, and vegan sources are just as effective as non-vegan sources.\n\nD. Calcium: While calcium is important for bone health, it is not as specific of a concern for vegans as vitamin B12. Calcium can be found in a variety of plant-based sources such as fortified plant milks, leafy greens, and almonds. However, calcium absorption is often improved when consumed with vitamin D, which is another nutrient of concern for vegans.",
