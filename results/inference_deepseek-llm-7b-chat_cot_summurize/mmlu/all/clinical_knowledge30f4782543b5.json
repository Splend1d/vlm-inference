Blood type B (rhesus negative) only.\n\nA person with blood group B (rhesus negative) can receive blood from anyone with a blood group B (rhesus negative), as both are of the same blood type and rhesus negative. Blood group B (rhesus negative) can also receive blood group O (rhesus negative) as it is the universal blood donor. However, blood group B (rhesus negative) should avoid receiving blood group AB (rhesus negative) and blood group B (rhesus positive) as they may experience an immune reaction due to the presence of the rhesus factor.",
