How many gallons of soup will Chesa make this year?\n\nA. 64\nB. 16\nC. 4\nD. 2\n\nassistant:Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Chesa made 32 one-cup servings of soup last year.\n2. This year, she will make two times the amount of soup that she made last year.\n3. To find out how many one-cup servings of soup she will make this year, we multiply the number of servings last year by 2: 32 servings * 2 = 64 servings.\n4. To find out how many gallons of soup she will make this year, we need to convert the number of servings to gallons.\n5. There are 4 cups in a gallon, so we divide the number of servings this year by 4: 64 servings / 4 = 16 gallons.\n\nThe answer is B. 16 gallons.",
