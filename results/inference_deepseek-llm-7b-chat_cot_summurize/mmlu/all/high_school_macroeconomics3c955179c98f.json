The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both fall.\n\nassistant:The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity of good Z will both fall, which corresponds to option D.\n\nA close substitute for good Z is good X. When the price of good X rises, it becomes more expensive for consumers to purchase good Z as a substitute. This will reduce the demand for good Z, leading to a fall in the equilibrium quantity of good Z.\n\nAt the same time, the higher price of good X will also increase the price of good Z, leading to a rise in the equilibrium price of good Z.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price of good Z will fall, and the equilibrium quantity of good Z will fall.",
