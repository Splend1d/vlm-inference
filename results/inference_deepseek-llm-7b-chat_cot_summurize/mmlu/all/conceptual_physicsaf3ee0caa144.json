Doesn't become radioactive. When food is exposed to gamma radiation, it doesn't become radioactive. Gamma radiation is a form of ionizing radiation that can interact with matter, but it doesn't cause the food to become radioactive. Instead, it may alter the chemical or physical properties of the food, such as changing the color, texture, or taste. Gamma radiation is often used in food processing and preservation, as it can help to kill bacteria and extend the shelf life of the food. However, it's important to note that excessive exposure to gamma radiation can be harmful to humans and animals, so it should be used with caution.",
