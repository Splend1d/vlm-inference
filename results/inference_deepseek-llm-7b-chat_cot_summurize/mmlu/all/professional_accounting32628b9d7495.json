(2,3),(2,2),(4,2)\n\nassistant:Based on the information provided, we can create a scatter diagram with standard deviation on the x-axis and return on the y-axis. \n\nFrom the scatter diagram, we can observe that the points (2,2) and (2,3) are closer to the origin (0,0), which indicates lower risk and return. The point (4,2) is further away from the origin, indicating higher risk and return. Therefore, the investor would prefer to invest in the first two pairs (2,2) and (2,3) before considering the third pair (4,2). \n\nSo, the order of the pairs from least to most favourable is:\n\nA. (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
