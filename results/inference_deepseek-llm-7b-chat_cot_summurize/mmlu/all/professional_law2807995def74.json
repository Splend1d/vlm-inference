In September 1989, the doctor executed a warranty deed conveying the timberland property to a dentist in fee simple. The dentist recorded immediately in the Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Index. Then in April 1990, the dentist conveyed the same tract to a buyer in fee simple by warranty deed. The buyer paid full market value and recorded the deed at once in the Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Index. The land in question had never been occupied, fenced, or cleared except that between the years 1986 \u0080\u00942010, a mining company, one mile from the property, regularly drove trucks over a cleared path pursuant to a 1986 agreement with the doctor. The agreement, which was duly recorded, provided that \"the parties expressly agree and the doctor promises that the doctor and his successors shall refrain from obstructing the said described pathway across the doctor's land, which the mining company and its successors may perpetually use as a road, in consideration of which the mining company and its successors will pay the sum of $700 per annum. \"In 1990, after the conveyance from the dentist, the buyer informed the mining company that he would no longer honor the 1986 agreement permitting the mining company to use the pathway. The mining company brought an action for specific performance. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the mining company, because their property interest would \"run with the land. \"\nB. the mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.\nC. the buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.\nD. the buyer, because there was no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.\n\nExplanation: A servient estate is the interest that benefits from the dominant estate, and in this case, the mining company has a servient estate over the pathway that runs through the doctor's land. The doctor, as the original owner of the land, has the dominant estate. When the doctor conveyed the land to the dentist, the mining company's agreement with the doctor continued to be valid. When the dentist conveyed the land to the buyer, the mining company's right to use the pathway as a road was still in effect, and the buyer should honor the 1986 agreement. Therefore, the possessor of the servient interest, the mining company, would prevail against the subsequent owner, the buyer.",
