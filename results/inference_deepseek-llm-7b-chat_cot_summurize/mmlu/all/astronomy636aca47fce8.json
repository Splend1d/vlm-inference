The spectrum of a particular star shows the same hydrogen line appearing at a wavelength of 485.9 nm. What can we conclude?\n\nA. The star is getting hotter.\nB. The star is getting colder.\nC. The star is moving toward us.\nD. The star is moving away from us.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of red shift and blue shift in the context of light waves. When a star appears to be moving away from us, its light waves stretch out, making the light appear redder. This is known as a red shift. On the other hand, when a star appears to be moving towards us, its light waves compress, making the light appear bluer. This is known as a blue shift.\n\nThe given information states that a particular spectral line formed by hydrogen appears at a wavelength of 486.1 nanometers (nm) in laboratory measurements. The spectrum of a particular star shows the same hydrogen line appearing at a wavelength of 485.9 nm. This difference in wavelength (486.1 nm - 485.9 nm = 0.2 nm) is very small.\n\nThe fact that the star's spectral line appears at a wavelength of 0.2 nm shorter than the laboratory measurement indicates that the star is moving away from us. This is consistent with option D. The star is moving away from us.\n\nTo conclude, the answer is D. The star is moving away from us.",
