Maine\nB. Savigny\nC. Pound\nD. Laski\n\nassistant:I cannot answer the question about who said that \"Jurisprudence is the eye of law\" without conducting further research. However, I can provide you with some information about the origin of this quote.\n\nThe quote \"Jurisprudence is the eye of law\" was first used by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, a German jurist and one of the founders of modern legal thought. Savigny believed that jurisprudence was the foundation of legal science and that it was necessary to understand the historical and social context of a legal system in order to properly interpret its laws. He believed that jurisprudence was the key to understanding the meaning and purpose of law.\n\nIt is possible that the quote was later attributed to other legal scholars, but it is most closely associated with Savigny.",
