Inadmissible, because neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results had been admitted into evidence at the time he formulated his opinion.\n\nAccording to the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), an opinion testimony is inadmissible if it is not based on sufficient facts or data. In this case, the team physician's opinion is not based on the x-rays or the MRI test results that have not been admitted into evidence. Therefore, the opinion testimony of the team physician should not be admitted into evidence at trial.",
