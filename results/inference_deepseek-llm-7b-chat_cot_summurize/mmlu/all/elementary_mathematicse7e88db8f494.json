The reciprocals of the fractions are obtained by flipping the numerator and denominator. So, the reciprocals of 2/5 and 1/10 are:\n\n2/5 = 1/2 (flipping the numerator and denominator)\n1/10 = 1/1 (no flipping necessary)\n\nNow we compare the two reciprocals:\n\n1/2 > 1/1\n\nTherefore, 2/5 is greater than 1/10. So the answer is A. 1 over 5.",
