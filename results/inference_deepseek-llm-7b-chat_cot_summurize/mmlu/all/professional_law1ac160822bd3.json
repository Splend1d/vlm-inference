This means that the tenant's obligation to pay rent continued even after the tenant assigned their leasehold interest to the attorney and the attorney assigned it to the doctor. As a result, the tenant's obligation to pay rent remained with the landlord and the doctor's failure to pay rent would be a breach of the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease.",
