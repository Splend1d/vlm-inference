In this case, if the envisioned results of the action or practice under consideration turn out not to be bad, then the argument is still fallacious because the central idea of the argument is not plausible. Therefore, options A and B would both make the argument fallacious.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{both A and B}}$.",
