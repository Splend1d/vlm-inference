It is a long, complex molecule that stores and transmits genetic information in the form of a code. DNA is made up of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of the genetic code.\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) is another type of nucleic acid that plays a role in the expression of genetic information by carrying genetic instructions from DNA to the ribosomes, where proteins are synthesized.\n\nDinitronucleic acid (DNA) is not a correct answer, as it is not a known type of nucleic acid.\n\nProtein is not the genetic material, but it is synthesized from the information encoded in DNA and RNA.",
