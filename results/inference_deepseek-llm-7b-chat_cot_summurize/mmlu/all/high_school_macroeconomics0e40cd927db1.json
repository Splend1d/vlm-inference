Labor\nB. Capital\nC. Human wants\nD. Land\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each option and determine which one is not a scarce economic resource.\n\nA. Labor: Labor is a scarce economic resource because there is a finite amount of work that humans can perform in a given time period.\n\nB. Capital: Capital is a scarce economic resource because it refers to the financial and non-financial assets that are used to produce goods and services. These resources are limited and need to be allocated efficiently to maximize output.\n\nC. Human wants: Human wants are not scarce economic resources. They are a result of the limitations imposed by the availability of resources and the ability to satisfy them.\n\nD. Land: Land is a scarce economic resource because it is a finite and limited resource that can be used to produce goods and services.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Human wants are not a scarce economic resource.",
