Dendrite\nB. Glial cell\nC. Nerve center\nD. Synapse\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Synapse. A synapse is the point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another neuron. The process occurs when the axon of one neuron releases a neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft, which then binds to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, causing a change in the membrane potential and potentially generating an action potential.",
