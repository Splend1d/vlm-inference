Expensed in the year in which the research and development project started.\nB. Capitalized and depreciated over the term of the research and development project.\nC. Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.\nD. Either capitalized or expensed, but not both, depending on the term of the research and development project.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Expensed in the year in which the research and development project started.\n\nExplanation: According to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the cost of equipment used in research and development activities that will have alternative future uses should be expensed in the year in which the research and development project started. This is because the equipment is being used to generate future economic benefits, and it is expected that the costs will be recovered through the future revenues generated by the new uses of the equipment.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it complies with the GAAP guidelines for accounting for research and development costs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the costs should be expensed in the year the project started, which is not in accordance with the GAAP guidelines.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that the costs should be capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life, which is not in accordance with the GAAP guidelines.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that either capitalization or expensing is allowed, which is not the case. According to the GAAP guidelines, the costs should be expensed in the year the project started.",
