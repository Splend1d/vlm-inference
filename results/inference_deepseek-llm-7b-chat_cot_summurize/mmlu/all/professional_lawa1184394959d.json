As he nervously looked around for police, the cashier reached out and attempted to grab the gun. Max then droped the gun, which accidentally discharged, killing a nearby customer.

Convicted, because intent to commit serious bodily harm is assumed when a deadly weapon is used.\n\nassistant:Max is charged with first degree murder because any death that is a natural and probable consequence of a felony is considered first degree murder. In this case, the cashier's actions were not the proximate cause of the death, so option B is incorrect. Additionally, the fact that Max lacked the necessary intent required for first degree murder does not exempt him from being convicted, as the charge is still first degree murder. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Lastly, while it is true that intent to commit serious bodily harm is assumed when a deadly weapon is used, this does not apply to first degree murder charges, so option D is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Max will likely be convicted, because any death that is a natural and probable consequence of a felony is first degree murder.",
