Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust, an inspector tests a sample of units, calculating a mean of 9350 pounds with a z-score of -2.46 and a P-value of 0.0069. Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?\n\nA. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9350 pounds.\nB. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.\nC. 0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds.\nD. There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.\n\nassistant:To determine the most reasonable conclusion, we need to calculate the probability of having a mean thrust of 9500 pounds or higher with a given P-value and Z-score.\n\nWe know that the Z-score is -2.46, which means the mean thrust is 9500 pounds (the Z-score is the number of standard deviations away from the mean). The P-value is 0.0069, which indicates that the observed mean thrust is less likely to have occurred by chance (a P-value of 0.01 or lower is considered statistically significant).\n\nWe can use the Z-score and P-value to calculate the probability of having a mean thrust of 9500 pounds or higher. The formula for this is:\n\nP(mean thrust > 9500) = P(Z > Z_threshold) = 1 - P(Z <= Z_threshold)\n\nwhere Z_threshold is the Z-score, which is -2.46 in this case.\n\nP(Z <= -2.46) = P(Z <= -2.46 | mean thrust = 9500) = 0.0069\n\n1 - 0.0069 = 0.9931\n\nSo, 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.\n\nThe most reasonable conclusion is option B.",
