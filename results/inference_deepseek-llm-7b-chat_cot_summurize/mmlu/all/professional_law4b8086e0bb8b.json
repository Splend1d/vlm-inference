A downward slope exists from the homeowner's land to the sister's land. The homeowner's and daughter's lots were in an unimproved natural state. The sister, however, had lived for 10 years in a house that she had built on her property.

The daughter completed construction of her house and macadamized an area for use as a driveway without changing the former contours of the land. Shortly thereafter, the sister began to make complaints to the daughter about the flooding of her basement, which she claimed had been previously free of water. The sister then built a concrete wall three feet along her border with the daughter to prevent the flow of rain water running onto her land from the daughter's property.

The downward slope from the homeowner's land to the sister's land means that any water from the daughter's land would naturally flow towards the sister's land. The sister built a wall to prevent this flow, which is an obstruction of the natural water flow. The daughter has the right to demand that the sister remove the wall, as it is preventing the natural flow of water onto her property.\n\nThe sister's previous occupation on her land and the daughter's excavation of her land do not change the fact that the wall is an obstruction of the natural water flow. The daughter's actions, such as excavating her land and building a driveway, do not give the sister the right to build the wall and obstruct the natural flow of water.\n\nTherefore, the sister must remove the wall to allow the natural flow of water to continue, and she cannot be compensated for this action. The other options are incorrect because they either give the sister more rights than she has, or they require the daughter to pay for the wall removal, which is not justifiable given the sister's violation of the natural water flow.",
