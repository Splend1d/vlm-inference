Management's goal is to obtain a 20% contribution margin on all sales. If the new product has variable selling and distribution costs of $3.00 per unit what is the product's target variable manufacturing cost?\n\nA. $12.20\nB. $12.80\nC. $15.80\nD. 18.2\n\nassistant:To calculate the target variable manufacturing cost, we'll first find the contribution margin per unit, and then add the variable selling and distribution costs.\n\nContribution margin per unit = Expected selling price - Variable manufacturing cost\nContribution margin per unit = $19.00 - Variable manufacturing cost\n\nManagement's goal is to obtain a 20% contribution margin on all sales. So,\n\nContribution margin per unit = (1 + 0.20) * Variable manufacturing cost\nContribution margin per unit = 1.20 * Variable manufacturing cost\n\nNow, we can find the variable manufacturing cost:\n\nVariable manufacturing cost = Contribution margin per unit / (1 + 0.20)\nVariable manufacturing cost = $3.00 / (1 + 0.20)\nVariable manufacturing cost = $3.00 / 1.20\nVariable manufacturing cost = $2.50\n\nNow we can find the target variable selling and distribution costs:\n\nTarget variable selling and distribution costs = Expected selling price - Contribution margin per unit\nTarget variable selling and distribution costs = $19.00 - $3.00\nTarget variable selling and distribution costs = $16.00\n\nNow we can find the target variable manufacturing cost:\n\nTarget variable manufacturing cost = Target variable selling and distribution costs + Variable selling and distribution costs\nTarget variable manufacturing cost = $16.00 + $3.00\nTarget variable manufacturing cost = $19.00\n\nThe closest answer is C. $15.80.",
