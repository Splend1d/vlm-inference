This action does not involve any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character pulls out the eyes of another person and leaves them dangling so that the person is forced to watch them. This action clearly involves morally wrong behavior, as it involves extreme violence and causing extreme suffering to another person.",
