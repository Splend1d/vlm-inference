When the foot of the ladder is 10 feet from the building, the top is moving down at the rate of r feet per second, where r is\n\nA. 46/3\nB. 3/4\nC. 5/4\nD. 5/2\n\nassistant:Let's reason about the problem.\n\nWe are given that the ladder is 26 feet long and leans against a building, with its foot moving away from the building at a rate of 3 feet per second. When the foot of the ladder is 10 feet from the building, the top is moving down at a rate of r feet per second.\n\nLet x be the distance between the foot of the ladder and the building, and y be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to express the ladder's length (26 feet) as a function of x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 26^2\n\nWe know that x = 10 feet when y = 16 feet. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n10^2 + 16^2 = 26^2\n100 + 256 = 676\n356 = 676\n\nThis is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that x = 10 feet when y = 16 feet must be incorrect. We need to find the relationship between x and y when y = 16 feet.\n\nLet's try another approach. When the foot of the ladder is 10 feet from the building, the top is moving down at the rate of r feet per second. We can use this information to express the distance y as a function of time t (in seconds).\n\nWhen y = 16 feet, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to express the height of the building as a function of time t:\n\n16^2 + x^2 = 26^2\n256 + x^2 = 676\nx^2 = 420\nx = \u221a420\n\nNow, let's find the rate of change of y with respect to time t:\n\ndy/dt = r\n\nWe know that when y = 16 feet, the foot of the ladder is moving away from the building at a rate of 3 feet per second. This means that x is changing at a rate of 3 feet per second:\n\ndx/dt = 3\n\nWe can use the chain rule to express dy/dt in terms of dx/dt and x:\n\ndy/dt = (dx/dt) / (\u221a420)\n\nNow we can substitute the value of dx/dt:\n\ndy/dt = (3) / (\u221a420)\n\nWe know that when y = 16 feet, t = 0 seconds. Therefore, dy/dt = r = (3) / (\u221a420) feet per second.\n\nWe can now use the chain rule again to express dx/dt in terms of dy/dt and x:\n\ndx/dt = (dy/dt) / (\u221a420)\n\nSubstituting the value of dy/dt:\n\ndx/dt = [(3) / (\u221a420)] / (\u221a420)\n\ndx/dt = 3 / 420\n\nNow we can use the Pythagorean theorem to express x in terms of t:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 26^2\nx^2 = 26^2 - y^2\n\nSince y^2 = 420 - x^2, we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\nx^2 = 26^2 - (420 - x^2)\nx^2 = 676 - 420 + x^2\nx^2 = 256 + x^2\n\nNow we can use the chain rule to express dy/dt in terms of dx/dt:\n\ndy/dt = (dx/dt) / (\u221a420)\n\nWe know that when y = 16 feet, dy/dt = r = (3) / (\u221a420) feet per second. We can use this value to solve for dx/dt:\n\n(3) / (\u221a420) = (dx/dt) / (\u221a420)\n3 = dx/dt\n\nNow we can use the chain rule again to express dx/dt in terms of dy/dt and x:\n\ndx/dt = (dy/dt) / (\u221a420)\n\nSubstituting the value of dy/dt:\n\ndx/dt = [(3) / (\u221a420)] / (\u221a420)\n\ndx/dt = 3 / 420\n\nWe know that when y",
