Scenario 1 | I pawned my husband's prized guitar to pay for his heart operation. Scenario 2 | I didn't get the office job because I bombed the building.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong. In the first scenario, the main character pawns her husband's prized guitar to pay for his heart operation, which may be seen as morally wrong by some people. However, it's not clear that the action is clearly morally wrong in all cases, as it may depend on the specific circumstances and the character's intentions. In the second scenario, the main character doesn't get the office job because she bombed the building, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
