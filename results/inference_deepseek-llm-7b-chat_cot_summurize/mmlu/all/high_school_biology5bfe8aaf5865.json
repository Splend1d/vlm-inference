Which of the following would be the first expected response after the application of oligomycin to cells?\n\nA. Water production would increase.\nB. H+ would increase inside the intermembrane space (the compartment between inner and outer membranes).\nC. H+ would increase in the matrix (inside mitochondrial inner membrane).\nD. H+ would increase outside mitochondria.\n\nassistant:After applying oligomycin to cells, the first expected response would be that H+ would increase inside the intermembrane space (the compartment between inner and outer membranes). This is because oligomycin blocks ATP synthase, which is necessary for generating H+ ions, and as a result, the concentration of H+ ions increases in the intermembrane space. This disruption of the proton gradient can lead to various consequences for the cell, including a decrease in ATP production and an increase in the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to ADP and other substrates.",
