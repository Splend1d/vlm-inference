Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools.\n\nThe lungfish's ability to release urea instead of ammonia as a nitrogen waste is an advantage because ammonia is highly toxic. If the lungfish were to release ammonia, it would endanger them and potentially make the small, stagnant pools uninhabitable for them. The other options do not explain the advantage of releasing urea: A) urea is not insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom, C) other fish cannot use urea as an energy source, and D) urea does not make the pool uninhabitable to competitors.",
