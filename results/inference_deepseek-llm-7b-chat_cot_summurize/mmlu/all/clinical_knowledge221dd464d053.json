These steroids are designed to mimic the effects of testosterone in the body, such as increasing muscle mass, strength, and endurance. Some examples of performance-enhancing synthetic steroids include anabolic steroids, which are synthetic derivatives of testosterone, and corticosteroids, which are synthetic derivatives of cortisol.",
