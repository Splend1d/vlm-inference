The consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The CPI is calculated by comparing the prices of a fixed basket of goods and services in the base period to the prices of the same basket in the current period.\n\nTo calculate the CPI, we need to compare the cost of the basket of goods and services in the base period to the cost of the same basket in the current period. If the cost of the basket in the current period is $400 and the cost of the basket in the base period was $200, then the CPI has risen by 50 percent from the base to the current period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 50 percent, which is equivalent to 0.5 in decimal form.",
