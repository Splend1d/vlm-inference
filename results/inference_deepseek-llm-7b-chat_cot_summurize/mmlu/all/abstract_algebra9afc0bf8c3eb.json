Statement 2 | The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic. This statement is false. A homomorphic image of a cyclic group need not be cyclic itself. For example, the homomorphic image of the group of integers under addition, which is the additive group of integers, is a cyclic group, but its homomorphic image under addition is the real numbers, which is not cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian. This statement is true. If the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is non-Abelian, then it would mean that the group operation is not preserved, which contradicts the definition of a homomorphic image.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B.
