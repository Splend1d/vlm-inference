However, the judge appointed an attorney to represent him instead, which violated the defendant's rights. The appellate court should reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order based on this violation of the defendant's rights.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the court should not affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order, as they were both based on a violation of the defendant's rights.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the court should not affirm the conviction but not the reimbursement order, as both were based on a violation of the defendant's rights.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the court should not reverse the conviction because the defendant was denied the right to a non-jury trial, as the violation of his right to represent himself was more fundamental and significant.",
