            "content": "After months of negotiations, the United States and Canada entered into a tax treaty that provided that neither country would impose income taxes on citizens of the other nation. The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country.

The treaty created a property right in Canadian citizens residing in the United States that cannot be taken away without just compensation.\n\nassistant:The strongest constitutional basis that may be urged in support of the claim that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective is option C. A ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and, therefore, remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute. This means that the treaty with Canada, which was ratified by the Senate and is supported by both the United States and Canada, remains in effect until it is superseded by another treaty or statute. The President's unilateral termination of the treaty is not sufficient to render it invalid, as it must be superseded by another treaty or statute. Therefore, the Internal Revenue Service cannot collect U.S. income taxes from the Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, as the treaty remains in effect and provides that neither country will impose income taxes on citizens of the other nation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
