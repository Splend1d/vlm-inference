If a technological innovation made by someone in this firm were to significantly raise the firm's marginal physical product (but not that of any other firm's), then this innovation would\n\nA. reduce the firm\u2019s employment level, because fewer workers are now needed\nB. raise the workers\u2019 hourly wage as they now contribute more marginal revenue\nC. lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages\nD. lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. reduce the firm\u2019s employment level, because fewer workers are now needed.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers for the goods they sell and price takers for the wages they pay. If a technological innovation raises a firm's marginal physical product, it means that the firm can now produce more output with the same inputs. This increase in marginal physical product means that the firm can now produce more output per worker. Therefore, fewer workers are needed to produce the same amount of output, leading to a reduction in the firm's employment level.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the workers' wages are determined by the market wage rate, which is the price of labor in the market. If the firm's marginal physical product increases, it will produce more output and, consequently, its total revenue will increase. This increase in revenue will be distributed among the workers in the form of higher wages if the market wage rate remains unchanged.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the firm's decision to hire more workers or raise their wages depends on the difference between the new marginal physical product and the old marginal physical product. If the new marginal physical product is higher than the old marginal physical product, the firm may choose to hire more workers or raise their wages.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the firm's decision to hire more workers and pay them higher wages depends on the difference between the new marginal physical product and the old marginal physical product. If the new marginal physical product is lower than the old marginal physical product, the firm may choose to hire fewer workers or pay them lower wages.",
