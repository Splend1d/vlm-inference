The witness was not questioned about an affidavit he made for trial in which he stated that the incident occurred on a different date. After the witness left the stand, but before he was excused, the defendant's attorney offers into evidence the affidavit. Assuming that the affidavit is properly authenticated, the trial judge should rule it\n\nA. admissible as substantive evidence.\nB. admissible for impeachment purposes only.\nC. inadmissible, because the defendant's attorney failed to question the witness about the affidavit while on the stand.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Inadmissible, because the defendant's attorney failed to question the witness about the affidavit while on the stand.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, an affidavit is inadmissible as substantive evidence if it is not properly authenticated. However, the affidavit can still be used for impeachment purposes. Impeachment is a procedure used to challenge the credibility of a witness by exposing inconsistencies or contradictions in their testimony.\n\nIn this case, the defendant's attorney offers the affidavit into evidence after the witness has left the stand, but before he was excused. Since the attorney did not question the witness about the affidavit while the witness was on the stand, the affidavit would be inadmissible as substantive evidence. However, it could still be used for impeachment purposes.\n\nThe other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Admissible as substantive evidence: incorrect, as the affidavit would be inadmissible as a result of the failure to question the witness about it on the stand.\n\nB. Admissible for impeachment purposes only: incorrect, as the affidavit was not properly authenticated and therefore cannot be used as substantive evidence.\n\nD. Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception: incorrect, as the affidavit is not hearsay, but rather a statement made for the purpose of the trial.",
