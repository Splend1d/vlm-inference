Lowering reserve requirements would allow banks to hold less reserves, which could potentially lead to more loans, but it doesn't force them to hold more reserves.\n\nB. \"allow banks to make more loans and buy more investments thus decreasing the money supply.\" This option is also not entirely accurate. Lowering reserve requirements would increase the money supply, not decrease it. Banks would have more funds available to make loans and invest, leading to an increase in the money supply.\n\nC. \"allow banks to make more loans and buy more investments thus increasing the money supply.\" This option is correct. Lowering reserve requirements would allow banks to hold less reserves, which would in turn increase the amount of funds available for loans and investments, leading to an increase in the money supply.\n\nD. \"allow banks more freedom to merge and acquire other businesses.\" Lowering reserve requirements may provide banks with more flexibility, but it does not directly relate to the money supply or the ability to make loans.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option C.",
