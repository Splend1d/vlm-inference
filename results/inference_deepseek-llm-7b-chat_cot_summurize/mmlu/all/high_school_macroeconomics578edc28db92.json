In this scenario, the individual is not unemployed due to economic conditions or changes in the overall demand for goods and services, but rather due to the temporary gap between leaving their previous job and starting a new one. This gap can be caused by various reasons such as transitioning between jobs, relocating, or taking time off for personal reasons. Frictional unemployment is typically characterized by a relatively short duration and occurs when individuals are looking for new employment opportunities.",
