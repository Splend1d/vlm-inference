An upward shift in AFC.\nB. An upward shift in MPL.\nC. A downward shift in ATC.\nD. An upward shift in MC.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. An upward shift in MPL.\n\nWhen the per unit price of labor, a variable resource, increases, it means that the cost of labor also increases. This will cause the marginal product of labor (MPL) to shift upward. The marginal product of labor is the additional output produced by one additional unit of labor, and it is influenced by the price of labor. As the price of labor increases, the marginal product of labor will also increase, as workers will become more productive and efficient.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. An upward shift in AFC: AFC stands for Average Total Cost, which is the sum of all costs incurred to produce one unit of output. An increase in labor cost will not directly cause an upward shift in AFC, as it is influenced by many other factors such as the cost of other inputs, technology, and scale of production.\n\nC. A downward shift in ATC: ATC stands for Average Total Cost, which is the sum of all costs incurred to produce one unit of output. As mentioned earlier, the increase in labor cost will not directly cause a downward shift in ATC, as it is influenced by many other factors such as the cost of other inputs, technology, and scale of production.\n\nD. An upward shift in MC: MC stands for Marginal Cost, which is the cost of producing one additional unit of output. While an increase in labor cost may cause an increase in marginal cost, it is not the only factor that influences marginal cost, and therefore it is not the correct answer.",
