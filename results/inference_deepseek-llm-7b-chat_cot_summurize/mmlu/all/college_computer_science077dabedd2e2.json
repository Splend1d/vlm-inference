O(log N)\nB. O(N log N)\nC. O(log N) + 0(1)\nD. O((log N)^2)\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to use the recurrence relation to find an upper bound for f(N). We can do this by using the substitution method.\n\nLet's substitute x = 2N + 1 and y = 2N in the recurrence relation:\nf(x) = f(y) + log x\n\nNow, let's substitute y = x - 1:\nf(x) = f(x - 1) + log x\n\nNow, let's substitute y = x - 2:\nf(x) = f(x - 2) + log x\n\nWe can continue this process to get:\nf(x) = f(x - k) + log x\n\nwhere k is a positive integer.\n\nNow, let's substitute y = 1:\nf(x) = f(x - k) + log x\n\nNow, let's substitute x = 2N + 1:\nf(x) = f(2N + 1 - k) + log x\n\nSince f(1) = 0, we have:\nf(2N + 1) = f(2N + 1 - k) + log (2N + 1)\n\nNow, let's substitute y = 2N + 1 - k:\nf(x) = f(y) + log x\n\nWe can see that f(x) = f(y) + log x for all x >= 1, where y is a positive integer less than x.\n\nNow, let's find an upper bound for f(N). Since f(x) = f(y) + log x, we have:\nf(N) = f(2N) + log N\n\nNow, let's substitute y = 2N:\nf(N) = f(2N) + log N\n\nWe can see that the upper bound for f(N) is f(2N) + log N.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.
