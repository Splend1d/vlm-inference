HBrO\nB. HBrO3\nC. HBrO2\nD. HBrO4\n\nassistant:The strongest Br\ufffdnsted-Lowry acid among the given options is D. HBrO4. This is because the stronger the acid, the more hydrogen ions (H+) it can donate in a reaction. HBrO4 is the strongest because it has the highest oxidation state (-I) among the options, which indicates a higher ability to donate hydrogen ions.",
