Negligence occurs when the ski resort failed to maintain the lift properly, leading to its malfunction during the power failure. This could result in the customer's injuries.\n\nFalse imprisonment, on the other hand, occurs when the customer was unlawfully detained against their will on the lift for five hours. The customer was not able to leave the lift or call for help during this time, which could constitute false imprisonment.\n\nTherefore, the customer may have a cause of action for both negligence and false imprisonment.",
