The estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.\nD. Plant assets were retired during the current year.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each option and determine which one would be most likely to satisfy an auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year.\n\nA. Prior years\u2019 depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.\n- This explanation suggests that the previous years' depreciation expenses were underestimated, which could potentially lead to overstatement of current year's depreciation expenses. This would not directly address the significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year.\n\nB. Current year\u2019s depreciation expense was erroneously understated.\n- This explanation implies that the current year's depreciation expense was underestimated, which would result in significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts. This option directly addresses the issue raised by the auditor and could potentially satisfy their concerns.\n\nC. The estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.\n- This explanation suggests that the estimated useful lives of plant assets were changed, which could result in higher depreciation expenses. However, it does not directly address the significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year.\n\nD. Plant assets were retired during the current year.\n- This explanation implies that plant assets were removed from the company's assets, leading to a decrease in accumulated depreciation. However, it does not explain why there would be significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B. Current year\u2019s depreciation expense was erroneously understated. is the most likely explanation that would satisfy an auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year.",
