Licensee.\nB. Gratuitous licensee.\nC. Public invitee.\nD. Business visitor.\n\nassistant:The jogger's legal status in his utilization of the bathroom can be best described as a Public invitee.\n\nA Public invitee is a person who is invited to enter a property for the benefit of the owner or tenant, such as a customer at a store or a guest at a hotel.
