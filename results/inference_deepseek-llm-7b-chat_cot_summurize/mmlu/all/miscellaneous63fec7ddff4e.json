In this case, it is specifically referring to the length of a horse's hoof, which is the equivalent of one hand.\n\nThere are four hands in a foot, so if you take the length of a horse's hoof and multiply it by four, you will get the length of the horse in feet. Therefore, one hand is equal to four inches.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A. four inches.",
