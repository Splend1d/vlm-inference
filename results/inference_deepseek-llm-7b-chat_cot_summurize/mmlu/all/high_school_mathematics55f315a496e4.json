What is the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled? Express your answer as a fraction. (If the two numbers are the same, we take that number to be the \"larger\" number.)\n\nA. \\frac{161}{6}\nB. \\frac{161}{36}\nC. 161\nD. \\frac{161}{3}\n\nassistant:To find the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled, we can use the following strategy:\n\n- If the first die rolls a 1, the expected value of the larger number is 1.\n- If the first die rolls a 2, the expected value of the larger number is 2.\n- If the first die rolls a 3, the expected value of the larger number is 3.\n- If the first die rolls a 4, the expected value of the larger number is 4.\n- If the first die rolls a 5, the expected value of the larger number is 5.\n- If the first die rolls a 6, the expected value of the larger number is 6.\n\nWe then multiply each expected value by the probability of that event happening, and sum them all up.\n\n- The probability of the first die rolling a 1 is 1/6.\n- The probability of the first die rolling a 2 is 1/6.\n- The probability of the first die rolling a 3 is 1/6.\n- The probability of the first die rolling a 4 is 1/6.\n- The probability of the first die rolling a 5 is 1/6.\n- The probability of the first die rolling a 6 is 1/6.\n\nWe can write the expected value of the larger number as:\n\nE = (1/6)(1) + (1/6)(2) + (1/6)(3) + (1/6)(4) + (1/6)(5) + (1/6)(6)\nE = (1/6)(1+2+3+4+5+6)\nE = (1/6)(21)\nE = 7/6\n\nHowever, this is the expected value of the larger number for the first die, and we need to find the expected value of the larger number for the second die. We can do this by finding the expected value of the smaller number for the first die and multiplying it by the probability of the second die rolling a larger number.\n\nThe probability of the second die rolling a larger number is 5/6 (since there are 3 numbers that are larger than the smallest number rolled by the first die).\n\nE = (7/6)(5/6)\nE = (35/36)\nE = 161/36\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the larger number is \\frac{161}{36}. The answer is: \\frac{161}{36}",
