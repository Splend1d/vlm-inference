Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\nA. Cannon-Bard\nB. Schachter-Singer\nC. James-Lange\nD. Erikson-Balint\n\nassistant:The theory that best explains this situation is the Schachter-Singer theory. According to this theory, emotions are the result of a combination of physical and psychological factors. In this case, Antoinette's physical response (racing heart and shrieking) was a result of the surprise party, while her emotional response (happiness) was a result of recognizing that it was her friends and not ninjas. The Schachter-Singer theory posits that our physical reactions to situations can influence our emotions, and that our emotions can also influence our physical reactions. This theory explains how Antoinette's initial fear and physical response were transformed into happiness when she recognized the situation.",
