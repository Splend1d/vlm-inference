The probability that either X or Y is greater than 3 is the sum of these probabilities:\n\nP(X > 3) = \u2211(1/2^n) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...\n\nP(Y > 3) = \u2211(1/2^n) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that either X or Y is greater than 3:\n\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = P(X > 3) + P(Y > 3) - P(X > 3 and Y > 3)\n\nSince X and Y are independent, the probability that both are greater than 3 is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(X > 3 and Y > 3) = P(X > 3) * P(Y > 3) = (1/2^n) * (1/2^n) = 1/4\n\nNow, we can find the probability that either X or Y is greater than 3:\n\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = P(X > 3) + P(Y > 3) - P(X > 3 and Y > 3)\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...) + (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...) - (1/4)\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = 2/2 - (1/4)\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = 3/4 - 1/4\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = 2/4\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 is 1/2, which is not among the given options.
