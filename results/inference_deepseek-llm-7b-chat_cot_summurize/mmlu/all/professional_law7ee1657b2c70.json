Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\n\nassistant:C. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\n\nThe injured pedestrian can assert a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer. If it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the truck, the pedestrian will prevail. The fact that the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck is irrelevant in this case, as the negligence claim is based on the auto dealership's responsibility for placing a defective car into the stream of commerce.\n\nThe farmer's negligence in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian is not a defense to the negligence claim against the auto dealership. The auto dealership's responsibility for the defect in the truck is separate from the farmer's actions in operating the vehicle.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, in this case, it is possible for the auto dealer to be held liable for the defective truck even if they exercised reasonable care in inspecting and testing the vehicle. The defect was a manufacturing issue, and the auto dealer should have been able to detect it through routine inspections and testing.",
