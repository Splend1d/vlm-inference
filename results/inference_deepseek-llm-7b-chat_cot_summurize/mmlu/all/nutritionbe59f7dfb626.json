Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported.\n\nThis statement is correct because the digestion of triglycerides begins in the mouth, where salivary amylase breaks down the complex triglyceride molecules into smaller fragments called mono- and diglycerides. These fragments are then transported to the small intestine, where bile salts emulsify the diglycerides and triglycerides, allowing them to be broken down further by enzymes called lipases. The fatty acids and glycerol produced by this process are then absorbed into the bloodstream, where they can be used by the body for energy or stored for future use.",
