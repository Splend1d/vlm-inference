The pharmaceutical company initially intended for the contraceptive to be available for purchase without a doctor's prescription. However, a study by the Food and Drug Administration revealed that the contraceptive might prove harmful to some users with preexisting health problems. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the contraceptive across state lines to those who do not have a doctor's prescription. This law is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because Congress has the power to provide for the general welfare.\nB. constitutional, because Congresshas the power to regulate interstatecommerce.\nC. unconstitutional, because it deprives the manufacturer a property right without just compensation.\nD. unconstitutional, because it interferes with the right of privacy of contraceptive users.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. unconstitutional, because it interferes with the right of privacy of contraceptive users.\n\nThis law is unconstitutional because it interferes with the right of privacy of contraceptive users. The Constitution protects the right to privacy, and this law violates that right by prohibiting individuals from purchasing a contraceptive without a doctor's prescription. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The general welfare clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate for the benefit of the public, but this law does not benefit the public as a whole. It only affects a specific group of people.\n\nB. The commerce clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce between the states, but this law does not regulate commerce. It only affects the shipment and sale of a specific product.\n\nC. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution requires that private property be taken only for public use and just compensation be paid. This law does not take private property, but rather regulates the sale of a product.",
