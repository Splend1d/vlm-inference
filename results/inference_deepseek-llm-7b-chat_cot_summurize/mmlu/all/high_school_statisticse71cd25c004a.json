Scores on the exam have been approximately normally distributed over the years it has been given. The exam is normed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 9. Only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation. Estrella received a 90 on the test. What was her percentile rank on the test, and did she qualify for further evaluation?\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n\nassistant:To calculate Estrella's percentile rank, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentile rank = (x - mu) / sigma\n\nwhere x is the test score, mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, x = 90, mu = 80, and sigma = 9.\n\nPercentile rank = (90 - 80) / 9 = 10 / 9 = 1.11\n\nTo find the corresponding percentile rank, we can look at the values in the top 15% of the distribution. We can also use a standard normal table or a calculator to find the z-score corresponding to a percentile rank of 1.11.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the z-score for a percentile rank of 1.11 is approximately 1.43.\n\nThe top 15% of the distribution corresponds to z-scores between -1 and 2. Since 1.43 is greater than 2, we know that Estrella's percentile rank is in the top 15%.\n\nTherefore, Estrella's percentile rank on the test is approximately 1.11, which is not listed as an option. However, she does qualify for further evaluation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.",
