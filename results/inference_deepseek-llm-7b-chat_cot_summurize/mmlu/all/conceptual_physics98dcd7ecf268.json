According to the formula for momentum, which is the product of mass and velocity, m * v = p, an increase in speed doubles the momentum. Since momentum is equal to the kinetic energy of the body multiplied by the mass of the body, an increase in speed doubles the kinetic energy of the body. Therefore, the kinetic energy increases but does not double.",
