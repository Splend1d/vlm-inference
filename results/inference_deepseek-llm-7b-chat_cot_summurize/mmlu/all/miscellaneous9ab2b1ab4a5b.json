If there are 7 gallons of gasoline in the tank, how many gallons of gasoline are needed to fill the tank? Which of the following is most appropriate to use to correctly answer the question shown?\n\nA. Multiplication\nB. Subtraction\nC. Estimation\nD. Division\n\nassistant:To find out how many gallons of gasoline are needed to fill the tank, you should use division. \n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Start with the full capacity of the tank: 15 gallons\n2. Subtract the current amount of gasoline in the tank: 15 gallons (full capacity) - 7 gallons (current amount) = 8 gallons\n3. Divide the remaining amount needed by the capacity of the tank: 8 gallons (remaining amount) \ufffd 15 gallons (tank capacity) = 0.56\n\nSo, 5.6 gallons of gasoline are needed to fill the tank.",
