Chicago\nB. Austin\nC. Pittsburgh\nD. Cleveland\n\nassistant:The first commercial radio station was located in Chicago, making the correct answer A. Chicago. Commercial radio broadcasting began on November 2, 1920, when WGY in Schenectady, New York, became the first station to broadcast continuously. However, the first commercial radio station licensed to a city other than Schenectady was WJJD in Chicago, which began broadcasting on November 27, 1920. WJJD was licensed to the Chicago Musical College (now called Roosevelt University), and it was operated by a team led by Edwin H. Armstrong, an inventor and radio engineer who later developed the FM radio band.\n\nIn the early days of radio, it was common for radio stations to have multiple call letters due to frequency coordination. For example, WJJD used the call letters W4XK, W4XJ, W4XK, and W4XJ during its early years. WJJD's initial frequency was 590 kilocycles, but it later switched to 1240 kilocycles, where it remained until the station's final broadcast in 1995.\n\nWhile commercial radio broadcasting began in Chicago, it was not the first radio station in the United States. That honor goes to KDKA in Pittsburgh, which began broadcasting on November 2, 1920. KDKA was the first station to broadcast live from a radio studio, and it covered the presidential election results that night, making it a significant milestone in the history of radio.\n\nTo summarize, the first commercial radio station was located in Chicago, with WJJD being the first radio station licensed to a city other than Schenectady. However, it was not the first radio station in the United States, as KDKA in Pittsburgh was the first to broadcast live from a radio studio and cover an event.",
