The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is given by:\n\n\u0394P = (8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * R^4)\n\nwhere \u0394P is the pressure drop, \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, L is the length of the pipe, and R is the radius of the pipe.\n\nIn this problem, the fluid flows through a single pipe of radius Q with flow speed V. The pressure drop across the single pipe is:\n\n\u0394P = (8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * Q^4)\n\nNow, the pipe splits up into three separate paths, each with radius (Q/2). The pressure drop across each of the paths is:\n\n\u0394P1 = (8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * (Q/2)^4)\n\u0394P2 = (8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * (Q/2)^4)\n\u0394P3 = (8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * (Q/2)^4)\n\nThe total pressure drop across all three paths is:\n\n\u0394P_total = \u0394P1 + \u0394P2 + \u0394P3\n\nNow, we can use the flow rate equation for each path:\n\nQ = V * (R_1 / (2 * (2 * pi)))\n\nwhere R_1 is the radius of each path.\n\nThe flow speed through each path can be calculated as:\n\nV_1 = Q / (R_1)\n\nTo find the flow speed through each path, we need to find the ratio of the flow speeds in each path to the flow speed through the single pipe. Let's denote the flow speed ratio as k.\n\nk = V_1 / V\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for V_1:\n\nk = (Q / (R_1)) / V\n\nSince the flow speed ratio is the same for each path, we can simplify the expression for k:\n\nk = Q / (2 * R * V)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the single pipe.\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for k back into the expression for \u0394P:\n\n\u0394P_total = (8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * (Q / (2 * R * V))^4)\n\nTo find the flow speed through each path, we need to find the value of k. We can do this by comparing the expression for \u0394P_total with the expression for \u0394P:\n\n(8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * (Q / (2 * R * V))^4) = (8 * \u03bc * L) / (\u03c0 * (Q / (2 * R * V))^4)\n\nSince the two expressions are equal, we can conclude that k = 1.\n\nTherefore, the flow speed through each of the paths is:\n\nV_1 = V\nV_2 = V\nV_3 = V\n\nThe answer is D. 4V.",
