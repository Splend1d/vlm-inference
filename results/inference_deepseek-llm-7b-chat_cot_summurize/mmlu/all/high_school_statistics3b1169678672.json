I and III\nD. II and III\n\nassistant:To determine which of the three options will result in a smaller margin of error, we need to understand the relationship between the margin of error, the confidence level, the sample standard deviation, and the sample size.\n\nThe margin of error for a confidence interval is given by the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = (Z * (Standard Deviation / sqrt(Sample Size))) * (t * (Standard Deviation / sqrt(Sample Size)))\n\nWhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, t is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, and Standard Deviation is the standard deviation of the sample.\n\nGiven the formula, we can see that the margin of error depends on two factors: the standard deviation of the sample and the sample size. A smaller sample standard deviation will result in a smaller margin of error.\n\nOption I, a smaller confidence level, corresponds to a smaller Z-score. A smaller Z-score will result in a smaller margin of error, but it will also result in a larger sample size (t-score). So, option I is not the best choice.\n\nOption III, a smaller sample size, corresponds to a larger sample standard deviation. A larger sample standard deviation will result in a larger margin of error. So, option III is not the best choice.\n\nOption II, a smaller sample standard deviation, corresponds to a smaller margin of error. A smaller margin of error is better, as it provides a more accurate estimate of the population parameter. Therefore, option II is the best choice.\n\nSo, the answer is B. I and II.",
