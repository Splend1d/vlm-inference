Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?\n\nA. Fatty acid oxidation\nB. Fatty acid synthesis\nC. Gluconeogenesis\nD. Glycogenolysis\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Fatty acid synthesis.\n\nMalonyl-CoA, a product of fatty acid metabolism, is known to inhibit fatty acid synthesis. This is the process that occurs when fatty acids are converted into energy, and malonyl-CoA's role is to prevent the overproduction of fatty acids. In this study, the subjects have hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which lead to increased malonyl-CoA concentrations. Since the increased malonyl-CoA concentration is shown to inhibit fatty acid synthesis, this is the most likely process that is inhibited.",
