Therefore, he should be found guilty of manslaughter of both his wife and the other man.\n\nA. guilty of manslaughter of his wife, but not guilty of manslaughter of the other man is incorrect because Howard's actions were reckless and intentional, causing the deaths of both victims.\nB. guilty of manslaughter of the other man, but not guilty of manslaughter of his wife is also incorrect because his actions were reckless and intentional, causing the deaths of both victims.\nD. not guilty of manslaughter of either his wife or the other man is incorrect because his actions were intentional and reckless, resulting in the deaths of both victims.",
