Ferguson (167 U.S. 537, 1897), the Supreme Court upheld the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, stating that segregation of black and white people in public facilities did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as long as the facilities were equal in every respect except for race. This decision was later overturned by the Brown v. Board of Education (347 U.S. 483, 1954) case, where the Supreme Court declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.",
