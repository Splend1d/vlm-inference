A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair.

However, there are certain exceptions to the hearsay rule, one of which is the pedigree exception. This exception allows for the admission of a statement made to establish the relationship between two or more persons, such as the relationship between a parent and a child.\n\nIn this case, the butler's testimony would be admissible under the pedigree exception because he is testifying to establish the relationship between the wealthy man and the woman. The wealthy man told the butler shortly after the woman's birth that she was his daughter, and the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case, which is whether the woman is entitled to a share of the wealthy man's estate.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the butler's testimony would not be violative of the hearsay rule. Answer B is incorrect because the Dead man's statute does not apply to this situation. Answer C is incorrect because the butler's testimony would not be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.",
