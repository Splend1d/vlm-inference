Yes, the administration of medications to render the defendant capable of standing trial, without serious side effects, is an important governmental interest, and even more so in a homicide case.\n\nThe court is likely to order that the defendant should be involuntarily administered the anti-psychotic medications. The defendant's mental state and history of mental illness, as well as the seriousness of the charges against him, weigh heavily in favor of the administration of the medication. The doctors have reported that the only hope to restore the defendant to relative normalcy where he could stand trial is by administering the anti-psychotic medicine. The medicine is in the defendant's medical best interests and is necessary to ensure that he can stand trial. Additionally, the administration of the medication is an important governmental interest, particularly in a homicide case.",
