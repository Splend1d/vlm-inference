They ran for local political offices on a platform to expand the treaty.\nD. They defended the treaty from the opposition of Chinese rebels.\n\nassistant:The Boxers, also known as the Righteous and Harmonious Fists, were a secret society that emerged in the early 1890s in response to growing foreign influence in China. They were a movement that sought to protect Chinese sovereignty and national pride from foreign encroachment, particularly in the aftermath of the Opium Wars and the Treaty of Nanjing (1839).\n\nThe Boxers were a diverse group of people, with some members advocating for peaceful means to protect Chinese interests, while others advocated for violent resistance against foreign powers. Some sources suggest that they were not unified in their views on the Treaty of Nanjing, and opinions varied among the membership.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Boxers were not active during the early twentieth century. They emerged in the 1890s and were suppressed by the Allied forces in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. Thus, it is not accurate to attribute their reactions to the legacy of the Treaty of Nanjing to the early twentieth century.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the given options accurately represent how the Boxers of the early twentieth century reacted to the legacy of the Treaty of Nanjing. The Boxer Rebellion occurred in 1900, and the Boxers were not a significant force at that time. It would be more accurate to say that they were a reaction to the growing foreign influence in China, rather than a direct reaction to the legacy of the Treaty of Nanjing.",
