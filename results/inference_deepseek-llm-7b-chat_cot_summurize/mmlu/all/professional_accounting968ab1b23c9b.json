Verify inventory pledged under loan agreements by confirming the details with financial institutions.

Inquire about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data. This option involves checking the status of recorded transactions based on preliminary data, which could be relevant for obtaining evidence about subsequent events.\n\nC. Compare the financial statements being reported on with those of the prior year. This option is more about comparing past and current financial statements, which might not directly relate to obtaining evidence about subsequent events.\n\nD. Trace information from shipping documents to sales invoices and sales journal transactions. This option involves tracing information from various documents, which could be relevant for obtaining evidence about subsequent events.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B would be the most likely procedure an auditor would perform to obtain evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events.",
