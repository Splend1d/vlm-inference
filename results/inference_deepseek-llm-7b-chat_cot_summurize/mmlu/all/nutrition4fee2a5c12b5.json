A reduction in lean body mass\nB. A reduction in physical activity\nC. A reduction in basal metabolic rate\nD. All of the above\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's go through each option step by step:\n\nA. A reduction in lean body mass: As we age, muscle mass decreases, leading to a decrease in energy expenditure. This option could be a contributing factor.\n\nB. A reduction in physical activity: Reduced physical activity can lead to a decrease in energy expenditure, but it's not the only factor affecting energy expenditure in older adults.\n\nC. A reduction in basal metabolic rate: Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum energy expenditure needed to maintain vital functions like breathing and circulation. It decreases as we age, but it's not the only factor affecting energy expenditure.\n\nD. All of the above: This option suggests that all three factors contribute to reduced energy expenditure in older adults. This seems to be the most accurate answer, as all three factors have been shown to play a role in reduced energy expenditure in older adults.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. All of the above.",
