Real GDP will increase.\nB. Real GDP will decrease.\nC. The price level will increase.\nD. The price level will decrease.\n\nassistant:To determine the answer, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. Technology makes production less expensive.\n2. Exports decrease.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible effects:\n\nA. Real GDP will increase.\nReal GDP is the total value of goods and services produced within a country. If production becomes less expensive due to technology, and exports decrease, it means that more goods and services are produced within the country, but they are not sold to other countries. This could lead to an increase in domestic production, which could result in an increase in Real GDP.\n\nB. Real GDP will decrease.\nIf technology makes production less expensive and exports decrease, it means that more goods and services are produced within the country, but they are not sold to other countries. This could lead to a decrease in the value of goods and services produced within the country, which could result in a decrease in Real GDP.\n\nC. The price level will increase.\nThe price level is the average price of goods and services in an economy. If technology makes production less expensive, it could lead to a decrease in prices, not an increase.\n\nD. The price level will decrease.\nAs mentioned earlier, if technology makes production less expensive, it could lead to a decrease in prices, not an increase.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely outcome is that Real GDP will increase, but it is not certain. The decrease in exports could lead to a decrease in Real GDP, but the increase in domestic production due to lower production costs could offset this. The price level will either increase or decrease depending on the relative importance of the two factors (technology and exports) on the price level.",
