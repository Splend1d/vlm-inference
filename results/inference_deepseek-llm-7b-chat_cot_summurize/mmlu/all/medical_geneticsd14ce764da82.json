Intron\nB. 3\u2019 Poly A tail\nC. Ribosome binding site\nD. 5\u2019 cap\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Intron. In eukaryotic transcription, introns are removed from the final mRNA before translation occurs. Introns are non-coding sequences found within the DNA, while exons are the coding sequences that will be translated into proteins. The other options are not removed before translation:\n\nB. 3\u2019 Poly A tail: This is a covalently attached molecule to the 3' end of the mRNA, helping with mRNA stability and translation initiation.\n\nC. Ribosome binding site: This is a sequence of nucleotides at the start of the mRNA where the ribosome binds to initiate translation.\n\nD. 5\u2019 cap: This is a modified nucleotide at the 5' end of the mRNA that helps with translation initiation by providing a binding site for the ribosome.",
