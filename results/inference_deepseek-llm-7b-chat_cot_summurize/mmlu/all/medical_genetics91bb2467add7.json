You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, will be:\n\nA. 0.4\nB. 0.32\nC. 0.08\nD. 0.02\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. 0.32.\n\nTo calculate the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, we can use the binomial probability formula: P(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * ((1-p)^(n-x)), where n is the total population size, x is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, carrying both alleles), p is the probability of success (allele frequency), and nCx is the binomial coefficient (number of combinations).\n\nIn this case, n = 100 (total population size), x = 2 (number of specific alleles), p = 0.2 (allele frequency).\n\nP(x) = (100C2) * (0.2^2) * ((1-0.2)^(100-2))\nP(x) = (100C2) * (0.04) * ((0.8)^98)\nP(x) = (100C2) * 0.04 * 0.1185\nP(x) = 877.78\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 877.\n\nNow, we look at the answer choices:\n\nA. 0.4 = 0.4 * 0.4 * (0.6)^(100-4)\nA. 0.32 = 0.32 * 0.32 * (0.6)^(100-4)\nD. 0.02 = 0.02 * 0.02 * (0.6)^(100-4)\n\nNone of these options are equal to 877. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 0.32.",
