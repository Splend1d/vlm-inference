The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings\nD. The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording\n\nassistant:The origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh can be traced back to ancient Sumerian civilization, which was centered around the city of Uruk, where Gilgamesh was a king. The Epic of Gilgamesh is considered one of the earliest known examples of epic poetry, and it was likely composed by scribes who were literate and had access to a written language. These scribes would have been responsible for recording and preserving the stories and legends of their society, including the story of Gilgamesh.\n\nOption A is not the best description of the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh. While scribes certainly played a role in the preservation of epic poetry, the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities is not the primary factor that led to the development of epic poetry.\n\nOption B is also not the best description. The rise of a merchant class in cities is not a significant factor in the origins of epic poetry.\n\nOption D is not the best description either. While the deeds of warrior elites may have been worthy of praise and recording, the development of epic poetry was not primarily driven by the rise of a warrior elite.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, is a more accurate description of the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings is a significant factor in the development of epic poetry. In ancient Sumerian civilization, the priestly class was responsible for recording and preserving the stories and legends of their society, including the story of Gilgamesh. These priests would have been the ones responsible for composing and recording the epic poetry of their time.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings.",
