Her mistake is due to the process of\n\nA. discrimination.\nB. generalization.\nC. accommodation.\nD. assimilation.\n\nassistant:Antonia's mistake is due to generalization. She has seen a cat before and assumes that the rabbit looks like a cat. This is an example of generalization because she is making a general assumption based on her previous experience. The other options do not fit the situation described: discrimination involves distinguishing between different categories, accommodation involves adjusting to new information, and assimilation involves integrating new information into existing knowledge.",
