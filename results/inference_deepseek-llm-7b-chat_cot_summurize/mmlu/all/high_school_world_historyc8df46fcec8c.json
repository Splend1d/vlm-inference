State-sponsored campaigns of genocide\n\nassistant:The passages above can best be connected with state-sponsored campaigns of genocide. The passages describe the violence and atrocities committed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which is also known as the First War of Indian Independence. The rebellion was sparked by a variety of factors, including social, economic, and political grievances, as well as religious and racial tensions. One of the key features of the rebellion was the killing of British civilians and soldiers by Indian rebels, which can be seen as a form of state-sponsored campaign of genocide. The passage by William Howard Russell describes the destruction of white civilians, while the passage by Rudrangshu Mukherjee emphasizes the hierarchical arrangement of races and the denial of \"humanness\" to Indians by the British, which contributed to the violence.",
