The conditional formation constant is affected by pH.\nII. The fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form varies with pH.\nIII. When EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, H+ is a product in most cases.\n\nA. I only\nB. I and II only\nC. I and III only\nD. I, II, and III\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of EDTA titrations and the factors that influence them. EDTA titrations are used to determine the concentration of metal ions in a sample. The titration process involves adding EDTA to the sample and monitoring the change in pH as the titrant (metal ion) is added.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nI. The conditional formation constant is affected by pH.\nII. The fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form varies with pH.\nIII. When EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, H+ is a product in most cases.\n\nOption A states that only I is the reason for buffering the solutions. However, this is not entirely accurate. While the formation constant of the EDTA complex does depend on pH (as mentioned in option I), it is not the only reason for buffering the solutions.\n\nOption B states that I and II are the reasons for buffering the solutions. This is partially correct. The formation constant of the EDTA complex does depend on pH (as mentioned in option I), and the fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form varies with pH (as mentioned in option II). However, this option does not account for the third reason mentioned in option III.\n\nOption C states that I and III are the reasons for buffering the solutions. This is also partially correct. The formation constant of the EDTA complex does depend on pH (as mentioned in option I), and when EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, H+ is indeed a product in most cases (as mentioned in option III). However, this option does not account for the second reason mentioned in option II.\n\nOption D states that all three reasons (I, II, and III) are the reasons for buffering the solutions. This is the most accurate answer. The formation constant of the EDTA complex does depend on pH (as mentioned in option I), the fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form varies with pH (as mentioned in option II), and when EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, H+ is indeed a product in most cases (as mentioned in option III).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",
