Steel cage matches are a common occurrence in professional wrestling, also known as WWE or World Wrestling Entertainment. These matches typically involve competitors trying to escape from a steel cage, which is lowered over the ring after a certain amount of time has passed. The first wrestler to escape the cage or force their opponent to surrender wins the match.\n\nBoxing does not typically feature steel cage matches. Fencing is a sport that involves two opponents using swords or other bladed weapons to attack each other, and does not typically involve a steel cage. College basketball is a sport that involves teams of players trying to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop, and does not typically feature steel cage matches.",
