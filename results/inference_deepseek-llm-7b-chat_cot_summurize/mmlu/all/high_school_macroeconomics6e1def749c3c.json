In the long run the tax cut will\n\nA. raise real output and raise the price level.\nB. lower real output and raise the price level.\nC. raise real output and lower the price level.\nD. raise the price level.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. raise real output and raise the price level.\n\nIn a simplified model of an economy, when taxes are cut, the government's spending increases, which can lead to an increase in aggregate demand. This increase in aggregate demand can cause real output to rise, as firms are able to produce and sell more goods and services. Additionally, this increase in aggregate demand can cause the price level to rise, as the higher demand for goods and services leads to an increase in prices.\n\nIn the long run, a tax cut can lead to an increase in real output and a rise in the price level.",
