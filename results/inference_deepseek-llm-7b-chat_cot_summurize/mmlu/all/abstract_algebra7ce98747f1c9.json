Statement 2 | The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G. This statement is false. A homomorphic image of a group G is a set that is closed under the group operation and has a left (or right) identity element. A factor group of G is a subgroup of G that is generated by a single element. While there may be homomorphic images of a group G that are not isomorphic to any factor group of G, it is not necessarily true that every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. This statement is also false. The homomorphic images of a group G are not necessarily the same as the factor groups of G. They are two different concepts that are related but not equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
