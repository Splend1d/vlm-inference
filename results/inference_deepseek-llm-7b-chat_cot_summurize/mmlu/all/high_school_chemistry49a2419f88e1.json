If the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, what will the effect on the entropy of the helium be?\n\nA. It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.\nB. It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.\nC. It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.\nD. It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\n\nassistant:The effect on the entropy of the helium will depend on whether the temperature is held constant or not. If the temperature is held constant, the change in entropy will be zero. This is because the entropy of a system is a measure of the disorder or randomness of the system, and if the temperature is held constant, the system will be in a state of maximum entropy (or maximum randomness). Therefore, the entropy of the helium will remain constant if the temperature is held constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.",
