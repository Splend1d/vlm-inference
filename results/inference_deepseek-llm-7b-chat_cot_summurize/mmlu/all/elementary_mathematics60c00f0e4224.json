You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Find the product of 5.7(8) mentally using the Distributive Property.\n\nA. 46.4\nB. 456\nC. 4.56\nD. 45.6\n\nassistant:Let's solve the problem step by step using the Distributive Property.\n\nThe Distributive Property states that (a \u00d7 b) = a \u00d7 b. In other words, when we distribute a factor across a sum or difference, we get a new sum or difference.\n\nSo, let's distribute 5.7 across 8, which is 8 + 7.\n\n5.7 \u00d7 8 = (5.7 \u00d7 8) + (5.7 \u00d7 7)\n\nNow let's multiply 5.7 \u00d7 8 and 5.7 \u00d7 7 separately.\n\n5.7 \u00d7 8 = 45.6\n5.7 \u00d7 7 = 39.9\n\nNow, let's add the two results.\n\n(5.7 \u00d7 8) + (5.7 \u00d7 7) = 45.6 + 39.9\n\nFinally, we get the answer.\n\n45.6 + 39.9 = 85.5\n\nSo, the correct option is D. 45.6.",
