Susceptibility can be positive or negative, depending on the material.\n\nA. non magnetic substances: This is not a valid option, as susceptibility is not related to non-magnetic substances.\n\nB. diamagnetic substances: This is the correct answer. Diamagnetic materials have negative susceptibility, meaning they are weakly repelled by a magnetic field.\n\nC. ferromagnetic substances: This is not a valid option, as susceptibility is not related to ferromagnetic substances. Ferromagnetic materials have positive susceptibility, meaning they are strongly attracted to a magnetic field.\n\nD. none of above: This is not a valid option, as one of the answers is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is B. diamagnetic substances.",
