Many of his stamps were extremely rare and highly coveted. On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection.

The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\n\nExplanation: In this case, the secretary mistakenly typed \"$75,000\" instead of $78,000, which the collector had specified. However, since the cousin accepted the collector's offer in his letter, the agreement is enforceable as it is. Therefore, the price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the price term is not $75,000, but rather $78,000.\nOption C is incorrect because the court does not reform the price to $78,000, but rather the agreement is enforceable as it is.\nOption D is incorrect because there is no mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact. The mistake was made by the secretary, not by both parties.",
