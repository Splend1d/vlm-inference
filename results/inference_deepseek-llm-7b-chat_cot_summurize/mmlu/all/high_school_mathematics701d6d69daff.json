What is the approximate area of the triangle?\n\nA. 62\nB. 72\nC. 84\nD. 112\n\nassistant:To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can divide it into two congruent right triangles by drawing an altitude from the vertex angle to the midpoint of the base. The area of one of these right triangles can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem and the special triangle formula for the area of a triangle.\n\nLet's label the altitude as h and the length of the base as b.\n\nSince the equilateral triangle has sides of 12 inches, the altitude h will also be 12 inches. Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the base, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the altitude and the sides of the equilateral triangle.\n\na^2 = b^2 + h^2\n12^2 = b^2 + 12^2\n144 = b^2 + 144\nb^2 = 0\nb = 0\n\nSince the length of the base is 0, this equilateral triangle has an area of 0. However, this is not a valid answer. To find a valid answer, we need to find an equilateral triangle with a non-zero base length.",
