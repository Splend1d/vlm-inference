In the Mesolithic period, people began to develop more complex societies and started to engage in trade. This trade involved exchanging goods and resources between different groups. However, compared to the Upper Paleolithic, the Mesolithic had fewer trading networks and more limited trade goods.\n\nIn the Upper Paleolithic period, people developed more advanced technology and tools, and trade became more widespread. People in the Upper Paleolithic traded more goods, traveled longer distances, and had more complex trading networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the main distinction between the trade patterns of the Mesolithic and Upper Paleolithic is that the Mesolithic had fewer goods exchanged but traveled farther distances.",
