Ex post facto laws are those that impose punishment for an act that, at the time it was committed, was not punishable by law. In this case, the state attorney was convicted of a crime after the fact, which would make the new law an ex post facto law. This argument would be strongest because it directly addresses the constitutionality of the new law, which is the main issue in dispute. The other options do not directly address the main issue of whether the new law is constitutional or not.",
