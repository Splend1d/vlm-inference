What happened to this \"lost\"water?\n\nA. it was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength\nB. it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape\nC. it was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians\nD. it was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape\n\nassistant:The \"lost\" water on Mars is thought to have been lost through a combination of mechanisms, rather than just one specific one. According to NASA, the water was likely lost through a combination of processes including:\n\n* Solar wind stripping: This is the process of water molecules being stripped away from the surface of Mars by the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles emitted by the sun. Over time, this process can cause the amount of water on the surface of Mars to decrease.\n* Breakdown by ultraviolet light: Ultraviolet light can cause water molecules to break down into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The oxygen atom would then combine with other atoms to form other compounds, while the hydrogen would escape into space.\n* Thermal escape: When rocks and other materials on the surface of Mars heat up, they can release water vapor into the atmosphere. This water vapor can then escape into space through the thin atmosphere of Mars.\n\nBased on these processes, the correct answer would be a combination of A and B. The water on Mars was stripped away by the solar wind and ultraviolet light broke it into hydrogen and oxygen, which were then lost through thermal escape.",
