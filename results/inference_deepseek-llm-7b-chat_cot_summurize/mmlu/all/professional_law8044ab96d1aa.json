In recent years, many outside organizations have entered the fairgrounds and distributed literature and paraphernalia to the many thousands of patrons visiting the fair. State fair officials did not endorse any of these organizations but permitted them to disseminate their materials throughout the fairgrounds without charge. Lately, however, many families attending the fair have complained about being harassed by canvassers from these various organizations. In an effort to protect the safety and welfare of the persons visiting the fair, the state legislature enacted a law prohibiting anyone from selling or distributing materials at the state fair. This new statute provided, however, that groups could pay a $50 license fee and distribute their literature from enclosed booths. These booths would be set up along the entrance to the fairgrounds and rented to anyone wishing to sell or distribute materials or soliciting money during the fair. The first year that the statute went into effect, approximately 40 groups rented booth space. There were various organizations paying the $50 license fee. A group of scientists opposed to the use of aerosol spray cans, requested permission to distribute literature at the fairgrounds. The scientists claimed that they simply wanted to warn people of the perils created by the disintegration of the ozone layer from the dispersion of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. State fair officials offered to lease the scientists a booth at the $50 fee, but refused to permit solicitation activities outside the booth enclosures.

This argument acknowledges the need for a regulation that protects the fairgoers from unwanted solicitations while also providing a fair and accessible platform for organizations to disseminate their materials. The fact that the statute does not discriminate among diverse viewpoints and offers an alternative means for organizations to reach their audience further strengthens this argument.\n\nOption A is not a strong argument as it only addresses the scope of the statute and does not address its constitutionality. Option B is subjective and does not address the constitutionality of the statute. Option D is not a strong argument as it focuses on the protection of privacy rather than the safety and welfare of persons using the facility, which is the primary purpose of the statute.",
