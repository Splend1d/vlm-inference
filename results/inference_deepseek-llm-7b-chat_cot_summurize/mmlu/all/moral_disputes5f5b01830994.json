The answer is A. act-based deontology. This theory is based on the idea that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by its intrinsic moral qualities, rather than the consequences of the action. Dershowitz believes that in some cases, where the consequences of an action are so extreme, it may be justified to break the rules, even if it goes against the intrinsic moral qualities.",
