Increasing size of nose and ears\n\nassistant:Option C, \"Enlargement of the heart,\" could very well be a cohort difference rather than a change that occurs with age. This is because the size of the heart increases during the first few years of life, due to the need for increased blood volume and cardiac output during growth. This is not necessarily a natural part of aging, but rather a developmental change that occurs at a specific time in a person's life.",
