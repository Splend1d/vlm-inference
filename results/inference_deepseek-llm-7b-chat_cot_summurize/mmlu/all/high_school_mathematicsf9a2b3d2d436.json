What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?\n\nA. \\frac{1}{4}\nB. \\frac{1}{3}\nC. \\frac{1000}{52969}\nD. \\frac{2500}{52969}\n\nassistant:To find the probability that the 5 randomly chosen integers each have a different tens digit, we first need to find the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nThe tens digit can be any of the 5 digits (2 through 6), and the units digit can be any of the 5 digits (0 through 9). Therefore, there are 5 choices for the tens digit and 10 choices for the units digit, giving us a total of 5 \\* 10 = 50 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 5 different tens digits. We can do this by considering each tens digit as a separate group, and then choosing the corresponding units digit for each group. There are 5 ways to choose the tens digit for the first integer, 4 ways to choose the tens digit for the second integer (since it cannot be the same as the first), 3 ways to choose the tens digit for the third integer, and so on. This gives us a total of 5 \\* 4 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1 = 120 favorable outcomes.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nprobability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes\n\nprobability = 120 / 50\n\nprobability = 12 / 5\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\frac{1000}{52969}.",
