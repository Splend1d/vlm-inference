Which of the following job-scheduling policies is starvation-free?\n\nA. Round-robin\nB. Priority queuing\nC. Shortest job first\nD. Youngest job first\n\nassistant:A. Round-robin\n\nRound-robin job scheduling is a starvation-free job-scheduling policy. In this policy, each job is given a fixed time quantum, and when a job arrives, it is put at the end of the ready queue. When the time quantum expires, the job is removed from the ready queue and goes to the back of the queue. The scheduler then takes the job from the back of the queue and assigns it the CPU.\n\nThis policy ensures that no job waits indefinitely for service because, after the time quantum expires, the job is removed from the ready queue and goes to the back of the queue, so it is guaranteed to be serviced eventually.\n\nPriority queuing, shortest job first, and youngest job first are not starvation-free policies because, in priority queuing, higher-priority jobs can starve lower-priority jobs; in shortest job first, the longest job can starve the shortest job; and in youngest job first, the job with the oldest deadline can starve the job with the latest deadline.",
