In the context of the system described, the output has an effect on the input quantity, which indicates that the system is adjusting its output based on the input received and then adjusting the input quantity accordingly.\n\nA. Open loop control system: This is a system that operates without feedback or any form of control, relying solely on the initial input. It does not take into account the output or the effect it has on the input.\n\nC. Neither A nor B: This option is incorrect because the system described clearly exhibits characteristics of a closed loop control system.\n\nD. None of the above: This option is also incorrect as it contradicts the correct answer, which is option B.",
