Tumour suppressor genes are a group of genes that play a role in preventing the development of cancer by controlling the growth and division of cells.\n\nA. APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) is a tumour suppressor gene that is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and the prevention of colorectal cancer.\nB. NF1 (neurofibromin 1) is a tumour suppressor gene that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and is associated with the development of neurofibromatosis type 1.\nC. RB1 (retinoblastoma) is a tumour suppressor gene that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and is associated with the development of retinoblastoma and other cancers.\nD. RET (receptor tyrosine kinase) is a tumour suppressor gene that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and is associated with the development of certain cancers.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options are not tumour suppressor genes.",
