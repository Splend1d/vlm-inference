Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is simply following the hospital's instructions to turn off their phone. This is a reasonable and responsible action, as it helps to prevent potential interference with hospital equipment. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character has the flu and chooses not to attend the office Christmas party. This decision is based on their own health and well-being, which is a reasonable and responsible action. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.",
