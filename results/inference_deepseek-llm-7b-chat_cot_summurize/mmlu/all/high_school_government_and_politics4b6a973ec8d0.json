This is because the electoral college system allocates electors based on the popular vote in each state. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must receive at least 270 electoral votes. In order to maximize their chances of winning, candidates tend to focus their campaigns on states that they are more likely to win, rather than spending resources on states that are too close to call.",
