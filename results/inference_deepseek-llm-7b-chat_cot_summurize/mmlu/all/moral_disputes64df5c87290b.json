None of the above\n\nActive euthanasia is the intentional ending of a patient's life by a physician, whereas passive euthanasia is the withdrawal or withholding of life-prolonging medical treatment, allowing the patient to die naturally. The question does not provide any specific scenario or situation where the patient would suffer more or less in each case. Therefore, none of the options A, B, or C can be considered as the reason for Rachel's belief.",
