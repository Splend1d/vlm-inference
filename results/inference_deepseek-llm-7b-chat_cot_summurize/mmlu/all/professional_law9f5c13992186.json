Relevance: The question is not relevant to the issues in the case, which are the defendant's actions during the barroom argument and whether he acted in self-defense. The question about the witness's tax return is unrelated to the case and does not provide any information that would be helpful in determining the defendant's guilt or innocence.\n\n2. Prejudice: The question could be seen as prejudicial to the defendant, as it may lead the jury to believe that the witness is not credible or has something to hide, which could affect their judgment of the case.\n\n3. Harassment: The question may also be considered harassment, as it is an attempt to dig into the witness's personal life and financial history, which is not relevant to the case.\n\nBased on these reasons, the correct answer is A. Improper, because it is not relevant to the issues in the case.",
