Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character ate a slice of their friend's tasty shoulder. While this may not be the most socially acceptable behavior, it is not clear that it is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character started a forest campfire and burned some twigs and shrubs. This clearly violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 by causing harm to the environment and potentially endangering lives.",
