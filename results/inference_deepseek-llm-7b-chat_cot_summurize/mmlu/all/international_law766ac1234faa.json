The coastal State enjoy ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources\nB. The coastal State may exercise sovereign rights over its continental shelf only upon its declaration\nC. The coastal State exercise sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploiting its fishing resources\nD. The coastal State may exercise only limited rights over its continental shelf and only upon the consent of its neighbouring States\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The coastal State enjoy ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.\n\nUnder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal States have sovereign rights over their continental shelf, which extends 200 nautical miles (370.4 kilometers) from the coastline. These rights include exploring and exploiting the natural resources of the continental shelf for the benefit of the coastal State. The coastal State has ipso facto (by virtue of the fact) and ab initio (from the beginning) rights over its continental shelf, meaning that these rights arise automatically and without the need for any explicit declaration.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The coastal State may exercise sovereign rights over its continental shelf only upon its declaration - This is not accurate. Coastal States have ipso facto and ab initio rights over their continental shelf, which do not require any explicit declaration.\n\nC. The coastal State exercise sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploiting its fishing resources - While coastal States do have rights over the fishing resources in their continental shelf, this option is too narrow in scope. The rights extend beyond just fishing resources and include other natural resources as well.\n\nD. The coastal State may exercise only limited rights over its continental shelf and only upon the consent of its neighbouring States - This is not accurate. Coastal States have ipso facto and ab initio rights over their continental shelf, which do not require the consent of neighboring States.",
