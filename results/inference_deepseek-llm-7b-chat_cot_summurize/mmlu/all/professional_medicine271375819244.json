Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time\nD. Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled as an emergency operation\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 2 years because many hernias close spontaneously.\n\nThis answer is supported by the statement \"many hernias close spontaneously\" which indicates that the hernia may resolve on its own, and therefore, there is no immediate need for repair. \n\nOption B is incorrect because oligospermia (low sperm count) does not develop before age 12, not age 12 years. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the timing of the operation should be based on the need for repair and not just on convenience. \n\nOption D is incorrect because herniorrhaphy is not typically an emergency operation and should not be scheduled as one.",
