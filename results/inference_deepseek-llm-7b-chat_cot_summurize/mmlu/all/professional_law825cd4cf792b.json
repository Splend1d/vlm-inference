Tainted the victim's identification of the defendant. The police requirement that the defendant state at the lineup, \"Get down on the floor and no one has to die today\" tainted the victim's identification of the defendant. The fact that the defendant was forced to speak in the lineup may have influenced the victim's ability to accurately identify the suspect, potentially leading to an unfair trial.",
