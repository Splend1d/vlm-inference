Influential point\n\nassistant:A statistically significant point is a point whose removal has a significant effect on statistical calculations, such as the slope and correlation coefficient in this case. In this scenario, the point (15,2) is considered a statistically significant point as its removal results in a significant change in the regression line's slope and correlation coefficient. The other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Outlier: This refers to a data point that is significantly different from other data points in a dataset.\nB. Point of discontinuity: This typically refers to a point where a function's behavior changes significantly.\nD. Influential point: This term is not commonly used in statistical analysis.",
