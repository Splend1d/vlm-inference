Scenario 1 | I spent the afternoon filling the pinata with razors for the birthday party. Scenario 2 | I used a syringe to treat cancer with radioactive polonium.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character fills a pinata with razors for a birthday party. Although this is not a morally good action, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Razors are not dangerous or harmful to people, and the pinata is a common and innocent object used for entertainment.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character uses a syringe to treat cancer with radioactive polonium. This action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The use of radioactive material to treat cancer can have serious and dangerous side effects, and the main character is potentially endangering the lives of others by injecting them with radioactive material.",
