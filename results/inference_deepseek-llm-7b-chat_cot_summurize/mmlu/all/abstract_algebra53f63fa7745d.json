Statement 2 | If H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha. This statement is false. The equality aH = Ha holds only if G is a normal subgroup of G, and in that case, aH = Ha only if a is in H (or the group operation is commutative).\n\nStatement 2: If H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H. This statement is true. If H is a normal subgroup of G, then for every a in G and h in H, ah = ha. This is because the operation of G commutes with the operation of H, so the product ah = a(h)h = ha.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. True, False.",
