The US Constitution does not require a defendant to be proven innocent beyond a reasonable doubt; rather, it only requires that the prosecution prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, the state statute requiring the defendant to prove mental incompetency by clear and convincing evidence does not violate the Constitution. Additionally, the appeal cannot be based on ineffective assistance of counsel due to the defendant's own failure to communicate with his lawyer.",
