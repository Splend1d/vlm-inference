Ulrich Zwingli\nB. Sir Thomas More\nC. Erasmus\nD. John Wycliffe\n\nassistant:A. Ulrich Zwingli\n\nUlrich Zwingli, a Swiss reformer, also expressed views similar to those of Martin Luther in his letter. Zwingli, like Luther, criticized the Roman Catholic Church's practices and teachings, particularly regarding the sale of indulgences, the authority of the Pope, and the corruption within the Church. He also emphasized the need for a reformation of the Christian estate.\n\nWhile Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli were both reformers, they had different approaches to their reform movements. Luther focused on the need for justification by faith alone, while Zwingli focused on the importance of Scripture as the only source of religious authority. Additionally, Zwingli did not support the idea of the priesthood, unlike Luther, who believed in the priesthood of all believers.\n\nB. Sir Thomas More is associated with the Catholic Church and is known for his work \"Utopia,\" which is a fictional depiction of a perfect society.\n\nC. Erasmus, a Dutch humanist and theologian, criticized certain aspects of the Catholic Church, such as its corrupt practices and the sale of indulgences. However, he did not advocate for a full-scale reformation like Luther and Zwingli.\n\nD. John Wycliffe, a British theologian, was an early reformer who criticized the sale of indulgences and called for the Church to return to the original teachings of the early Church. However, his ideas did not gain widespread support, and he did not initiate a full-scale reformation movement like Luther and Zwingli.",
