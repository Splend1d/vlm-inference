The contract clause of the United States Constitution states that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. In this case, the resident alien has already entered into a contract to buy 50 acres of land, and the statute would impair the validity of that contract by forbidding him from owning more than 10 acres. Therefore, the state's statute would violate the contract clause.",
