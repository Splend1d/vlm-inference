This karyotype is called Down syndrome and is the most common form of trisomy. People with Down syndrome typically have some cognitive and developmental delays, but many are able to lead fulfilling lives with appropriate support.\n\nA. 47,XXX is called Turner syndrome and is less common than Down syndrome. It causes developmental delays and physical abnormalities, and can also affect fertility.\n\nB. 47,XXY is Klinefelter syndrome, which can cause a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities.\n\nC. 47,XX,+13 is Edwards syndrome, which is a very serious condition that usually results in miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\nTherefore, the mildest effect on human development is D. 47,XY,+21, which is Down syndrome.",
