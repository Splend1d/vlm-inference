At trial, in its case-in-chief, the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence that the man had twice been previously involved in similar cases with other children. The prosecution argues that these past crimes demonstrate the likelihood that the man molested this child. Defense counsel objects to the evidence regarding other children. The judge should find the evidence\n\nA. admissible, because the man's past crimes may be introduced to show that he is more likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.\nB. admissible, because a common plan or scheme may be proven by other similar criminal acts.\nC. inadmissible, because past crimes may not be introduced to prove disposition to commit certain acts.\nD. inadmissible, because the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of bad character.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. admissible, because the man's past crimes may be introduced to show that he is more likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.\n\nThe prosecution is seeking to introduce the evidence to show the man's propensity to commit the crime of which he is charged. This is known as the \"prior bad act\" exception to the rule against admitting prior bad acts. According to this exception, evidence of prior crimes may be admitted if it is relevant to prove the defendant's propensity to commit the crime with which they are charged. In this case, the prosecution is arguing that the man's past crimes demonstrate his likelihood of having molested the child.\n\nThe defense counsel's objection is not likely to be successful. The judge would likely find the evidence admissible because it is relevant to the issue of the man's propensity to commit the crime with which he is charged.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the common plan or scheme exception does not apply in this case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the rule against admitting prior bad acts does not prohibit admitting evidence of past crimes to prove the defendant's propensity to commit the crime with which they are charged.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the prosecution is not initiating evidence of the man's bad character, but rather his propensity to commit the crime with which he is charged.",
