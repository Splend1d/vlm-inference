Statement 2 | If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1 is true. A group of order 15 must have at least 8 elements of order 15, as 15 = 3 * 5, and by the Sylow theorems, there must be a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 3 and 5, respectively. The group generated by these two subgroups will have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nStatement 2 is false. A group with more than 8 elements of order 15 cannot have at least 16 elements of order 15. This is because if there were 16 elements of order 15, then the group would be a semi-direct product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup, which would mean that the group would have more than 16 elements of order 15. Therefore, it is impossible to have a group with more than 8 elements of order 15 and at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
