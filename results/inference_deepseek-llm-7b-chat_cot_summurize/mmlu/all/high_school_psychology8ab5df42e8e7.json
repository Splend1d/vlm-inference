Identify the relevant information: The user mentions that Ben's study participants will take three tests with 35 multiple-choice questions each. Ben thinks students will answer questions printed on yellow paper more quickly than those printed on blue paper.\n\n2. Compare the information to the options:\n\nA. the color of the paper: This option is relevant to Ben's experiment because the user mentions that Ben believes students will answer questions printed on yellow paper more quickly than those printed on blue paper.\n\nB. the number of questions answered correctly: This option is not mentioned in the user's input, so it cannot be the independent variable in Ben's experiment.\n\nC. how long it takes students to answer questions: This option is relevant to Ben's experiment because the user mentions that all study participants will take three tests with 35 multiple-choice questions each. However, the user does not provide information about the time it takes for students to answer the questions, so we cannot conclude that this is the independent variable.\n\nD. the total number of questions answered: This option is not mentioned in the user's input, so it cannot be the independent variable in Ben's experiment.\n\n3. Choose the most appropriate option based on the comparison: Based on the information provided, the independent variable in Ben's experiment is the color of the paper.\n\nSo, the answer is A. the color of the paper.",
