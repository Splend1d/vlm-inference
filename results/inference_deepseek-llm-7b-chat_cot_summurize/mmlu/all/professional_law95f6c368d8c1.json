The statute states that it is the duty of a person being arrested to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. In this case, the suspect's actions (hitting the police officer with his fist) can be considered as a violation of this duty.\n\nThe fact that the police officer was arrested does not necessarily mean that the arrest was unlawful without probable cause. The officer may have had reasonable suspicion or probable cause to arrest the suspect. Therefore, if the arrest was lawful, the suspect should be found guilty, regardless of which account the jury believes.",
