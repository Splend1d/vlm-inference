It is often used to make predictions or to form hypotheses that can be tested through further observation or experimentation.\n\nA hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon that has not yet been confirmed or disproven. It is an educated guess that can be tested through experimentation or observation.\n\nOption B, theory, is also a possible answer. A theory is a general explanation of a group of natural facts or phenomena that has been tested and supported by a large amount of evidence. However, the term \"theory\" is often used more specifically to describe a well-established, widely accepted explanation for a particular phenomenon.\n\nOption D, scientific method, is not the correct answer. The scientific method is a systematic process for testing and refining theories and hypotheses through observation, experimentation, and analysis. It is not a proposed explanation for a phenomenon.\n\nOption A, deduction, is also not the correct answer. Deduction is a form of reasoning that draws conclusions based on logical principles. It is used to prove the validity of a statement or hypothesis based on the evidence provided.",
