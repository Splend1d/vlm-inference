Which of the following statements best describes the differences or similarities between the two terms?\n\nA. Both terms describe inheritance controlled by the interaction of multiple alleles at different loci.\nB.

Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two genes at different loci; epistasis describes the interaction of two alleles.\nD. Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two alleles on one gene; epistasis describes the interaction of two genes and their respective alleles.\n\nassistant:C. Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two genes at different loci; epistasis describes the interaction of two alleles.\n\nIncomplete dominance and epistasis are two genetic terms that describe the interaction of genes and alleles in the inheritance of traits. However, they differ in the way they describe the interaction between different genes or alleles.\n\nIncomplete dominance occurs when the presence of two alleles at a particular locus results in a phenotype that is a blend of the two parental phenotypes. It means that the allele from the parent with a dominant trait masks the effects of the allele from the other parent, resulting in a new, partially dominant phenotype. Incomplete dominance is a type of dominant inheritance, meaning that one copy of the dominant allele is sufficient to express the trait, and the other copy is masked.\n\nEpistasis, on the other hand, describes the interaction of two or more genes or alleles at different loci. It means that the effect of one gene or allele can depend on the presence or absence of another gene or allele. Epistasis can result in complex genetic interactions, leading to the expression of a trait that is different from what would be expected based on the individual effects of each gene or allele.\n\nSo, both terms describe genetic relationships controlled by the interaction of multiple alleles or genes at different loci. However, incomplete dominance focuses on the interaction between two alleles at one locus, while epistasis describes the interaction of two or more genes or alleles at different loci.",
