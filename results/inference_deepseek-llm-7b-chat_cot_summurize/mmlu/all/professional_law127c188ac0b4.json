The company was unable to keep up with the mill's needs, and its log deliveries fell short by 10% to 15% in each of the four quarters of the year. The mill paid the company on time for all delivered logs. The mill paid an attorney $2,000 for advice concerning its options in enforcing the contract.

If the court finds for the mill, how much should it award in damages?\n\nA. $205,000.00\nB. $225,000.00\nC. $230,000.00\nD. $232,000.00\n\nassistant:The mill should be awarded the maximum amount of damages allowed under the contract, which is the difference between the mill's actual losses and the amount the mill would have had to pay for logs if the company had fulfilled its obligations.\n\nThe mill's actual losses were $200,000. The mill would have had to pay for logs if the company had fulfilled its obligations as stated in the contract. The mill paid an attorney $2,000 for advice concerning its options in enforcing the contract and a broker $5,000 to find additional logs to make up for the company's shortfall. The mill also incurred reasonable costs of $25,000 to transport the additional logs to its facility.\n\nTherefore, the mill's actual losses minus the costs it incurred to mitigate damages is $200,000 - $2,000 - $5,000 - $25,000 = $198,250.\n\nSince the mill is suing the company for breach of contract, the court should award the mill the difference between the mill's actual losses and the amount the mill would have had to pay for logs if the company had fulfilled its obligations, which is $200,000 - $198,250 = $1,750.\n\nThe closest answer to the correct amount is D. $232,000.00.",
