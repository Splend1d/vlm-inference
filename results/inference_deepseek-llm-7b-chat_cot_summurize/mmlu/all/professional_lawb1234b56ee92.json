To the south of the man's land was a lot owned by a woman who lived on it in a house. Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nassistant:D. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nThe purchaser is likely to prevail because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house. This means that the purchaser had constructive notice of the easement, which is sufficient to establish an easement by prescription. The fact that the purchaser did not have actual notice at the time of acquisition does not negate the easement, as it was established through the prescription process.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished: The easement was not extinguished because the woman conveyed her house to the man three years ago, and the purchaser acquired the house two years ago. The easement was already established by that time.\n\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition: As mentioned above, the purchaser had constructive notice of the easement, which is sufficient to establish an easement by prescription.\n\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed: A warranty deed only provides a warranty that the seller has good title to the property, and does not affect the existence of an easement that was established prior to the acquisition of the property.",
