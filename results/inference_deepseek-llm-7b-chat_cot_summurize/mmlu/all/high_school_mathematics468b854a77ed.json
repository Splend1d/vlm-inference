The intervals are $a\\in[-3, -2)$, $-2 \\leq a \\leq -1)$, and $a \\in [0, 1]$. Similarly, there are $b\\in[-2, -1)$, $-1 \\leq b \\leq 0)$, and $b \\in [0, 4]$.\n\nThere are $11$ pairs in each interval where $a\\cdot b$ is positive.\n\nThe number of pairs where $a\\cdot b$ is negative is $11\\cdot 10$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $a\\cdot b$ is positive is $\\frac{11+110}{11\\cdot 10} = \\frac{121}{110} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{10}}$.\nThe answer is: \\frac{11}{10}",
