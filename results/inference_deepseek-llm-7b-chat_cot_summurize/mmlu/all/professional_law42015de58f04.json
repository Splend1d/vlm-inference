In September 1973, the woman mortgaged the 20 acres of timberland to the bank by a mortgage deed (in the traditional form of a conveyance in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent), which was not recorded until January 1974. The mortgage deed contained the following clause immediately after the legal description of the 20 acres of timberland:\"Together with all the real property now owned by (the woman) or which shall be owned by (the woman) during the continuance of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage. \" This mortgage was given, as the recorded instrument revealed, to secure a note for $100,000 repayable over a 40-year term. In March 2004, the woman, using money loaned by a finance company, purchased a 50-acre mountainous estate situated outside of a major city. This deed was recorded immediately. In April 2004, the woman executed and delivered to the finance company a mortgage to secure its loan. This mortgage was promptly and duly recorded. The finance company had no actual notice of the prior mortgage to the bank. In February 2007, the woman defaulted on both mortgages. The bank then initiated foreclosure proceedings against the woman and the finance company as joint defendants. In its foreclosure action, the bank averred that its mortgage was a first mortgage on both the 20 acres of timberland and the 50-acre estate. The finance company filed a cross-complaint, alleging that its mortgage was a first mortgage on the 50-acre estate and praying for foreclosure on that parcel of property. In order to decide this case in favor of the bank, the court does not need to resolve which of the following issues?\n\nA. Whether the finance company is charged with record notice of the bank's mortgage.\nB. Whether the quoted clause in the mortgage instrument to the 20 acres of timberland covers the 50-acre estate.\nC. Whether the finance company's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage.\nD. Whether the finance company can rely on the doctrine of implied purchase money liens.\n",

Whether the finance company can rely on the doctrine of implied purchase money liens.\n\nassistant:The court does not need to resolve issue B, which is whether the quoted clause in the mortgage instrument to the 20 acres of timberland covers the 50-acre estate. This is because the court's decision in favor of the bank does not require addressing whether the finance company's mortgage is a first mortgage on the 50-acre estate. The court's decision is based on the fact that the finance company had no actual notice of the prior mortgage to the bank, which means that it cannot challenge the bank's first mortgage position on the 20 acres of timberland. Therefore, the court's decision is not affected by whether the quoted clause in the mortgage instrument to the 20 acres of timberland covers the 50-acre estate.",
