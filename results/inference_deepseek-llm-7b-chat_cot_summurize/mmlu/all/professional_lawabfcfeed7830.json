The woman mortgaged the land to the mortgage company in 1993, and the mortgage was recorded in 1996. In 2007, the woman promised to convey the land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. However, the 2007 quitclaim deed made no reference to the mortgage. If the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, both the mortgage company and the daughter may have claims against the woman to enforce the terms of the mortgage and the 2007 promise.",
