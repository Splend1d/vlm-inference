Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.\n\nassistant:The first passage is from Olympe de Gouges, a French philosopher and playwright, who wrote \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen\" in 1791.

She urges women to oppose the force of reason to the pretentions of superiority of their leaders.\n\nThe second passage is from Halima Ghomri, an Algerian woman, who was interviewed in the 1970s after Algeria's war of independence. She talks about her experiences and expectations before and after the war, mentioning that nothing has changed for her and her family despite the war being over and them being free from fear of persecution.\n\nBased on these two passages, the observation that is best supported by the first passage is:\n\nD. Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.",
