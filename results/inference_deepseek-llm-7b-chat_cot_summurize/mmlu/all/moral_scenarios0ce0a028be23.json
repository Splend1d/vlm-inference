Wrong, Wrong: This answer is incorrect because there is a scenario where the main character does not do something morally wrong.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong: This answer is incorrect because both scenarios involve the main character doing something that could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong: This answer is incorrect because at least one of the scenarios involves the main character doing something that could be seen as morally wrong.",
