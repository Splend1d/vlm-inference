The Dred Scott decision denied African Americans the right to citizenship and the protection of the U.S. Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment, passed in 1868, declared that all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. This amendment overturned the Dred Scott decision and granted citizenship to African Americans. The Plessy v. Ferguson decision, passed in 1896, established \"separate but equal\" as a constitutional principle, while the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Jim Crow laws of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were separate developments that further restricted the rights of African Americans.",
