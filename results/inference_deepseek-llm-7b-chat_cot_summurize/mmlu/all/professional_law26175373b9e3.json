Late one night, the witness overheard the victim scream, \"The defendant, please don't do it!\" The next day the victim was found dead in her bedroom. The defendant was arrested and charged with murdering the victim. At trial, the witness proposes to testify to the victim's statement. Upon objection by defendant's counsel, the court should rule the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement\n\nA. admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.\nB. admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.\nC. inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. \n\nThe witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement is inadmissible because it falls under the category of hearsay. Hearsay is a statement that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The victim's statement is being offered to prove that the victim believed her death was imminent, which is the requirement for a dying declaration. \n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, a dying declaration is admissible if the declarant believed that the statement would be made last, the statement was made while the declarant was facing death, and the statement was made as a direct result of the declarant's impending death. If the jury determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent, then the witness's testimony would be admissible as a dying declaration.\n\nHowever, the statement made by the victim is not protected by any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Therefore, the court should rule the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement inadmissible.",
