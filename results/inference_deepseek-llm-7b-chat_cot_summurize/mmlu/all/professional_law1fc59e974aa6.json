The correct answer is C. The daughter's shoe store is a nonconforming use, which means that it is allowed to continue operating even though it does not conform to the new zoning requirements. Additionally, the zoning is cumulative, so the building is also allowed to be used for single-family residential purposes. Therefore, the daughter can continue to operate her shoe store and live in the apartment.",
