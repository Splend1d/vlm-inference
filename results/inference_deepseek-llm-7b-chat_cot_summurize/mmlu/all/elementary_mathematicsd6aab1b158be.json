There are 750 seniors at the college.\n2. Approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go on to attend graduate school.\n3. To find the number of seniors expected to attend graduate school, we need to multiply the total number of seniors by the proportion that attend graduate school.\n\nWe can represent this proportion as a fraction:\n\n2/5 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can multiply the total number of seniors by this fraction:\n\n750 * 0.4 = 300\n\nSo, 300 seniors would be expected to attend graduate school.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 300 seniors.",
