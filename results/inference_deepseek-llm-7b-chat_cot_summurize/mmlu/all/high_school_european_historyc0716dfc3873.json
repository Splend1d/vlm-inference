It also mentions that the number of Scribbling-Machines is significant and that they are capable of doing a lot of work compared to the number of workers they replace.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options given and match them with the main points of the petition.\nA. the spread of revolutionary ideas among the British working class in the eighteenth century - The petition mentions workers being distressed and having to rely on the Parish for support, but it does not directly discuss revolutionary ideas.\nB. the rise of the Luddite movement in Britain in the eighteenth century - The petition does not specifically mention Luddites, but it does discuss the impact of Scribbling-Machines on workers and the economy.\nC. the replacing of traditional laborers by machines in the industrialization of Britain in the eighteenth century - The petition clearly discusses the impact of Scribbling-Machines on workers and the economy, which is related to the industrialization of Britain.\nD. an increase in the use of child labor in eighteenth-century Britain - The petition does not mention child labor.\n\nStep 3: Choose the best answer based on the analysis.\nThe best answer is C. the replacing of traditional laborers by machines in the industrialization of Britain in the eighteenth century, as it directly relates to the main points of the petition.",
