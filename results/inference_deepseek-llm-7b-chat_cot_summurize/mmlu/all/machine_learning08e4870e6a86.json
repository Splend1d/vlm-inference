False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: The training error of 1-nearest neighbor classifier is 0. This statement is false. The training error of a 1-nearest neighbor classifier is generally high due to overfitting, as it memorizes the training data rather than learning a general rule. Therefore, the training error is not 0.\n\nStatement 2: As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant. This statement is true. The MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimate and the MLE (maximum likelihood) estimate both converge to the same value as the number of data points increases, regardless of the prior distribution. Therefore, the choice of prior becomes irrelevant in the presence of enough data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.",
