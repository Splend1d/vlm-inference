Identify the factors that are associated with longevity, which may include social support, BMI, alcohol use, and supplement use.\n3. Compare the factors provided to the user to determine which one is most strongly associated with longevity.\n\nBased on my analysis, option A. Social support is strongly associated with higher levels of longevity. Social support refers to the help and emotional and practical assistance received from social networks, such as family, friends, and community. Research has shown that social support can have a positive impact on physical and mental health, and may contribute to a longer life.",
