As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?\n\nA. No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.\nB. No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\nC. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. \u0080\u0083\n\nassistant:The court should deny the hospital's motion for summary judgment.\n\nThe patient has not produced any evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital's argument that a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors is not sufficient to grant summary judgment.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur, or \"the thing speaks for itself,\" is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to establish negligence by showing that an accident occurred under circumstances that would not have happened unless the defendant was negligent. While the hospital could argue that the accident was due to negligence on the part of the nurse, this would not necessarily mean that the hospital is not liable.\n\nThe nurse's action, in attempting to pull the wheelchair back through the doors, could be considered a superseding cause of the injury. However, this does not absolve the hospital of liability for the accident. The hospital is responsible for maintaining the automatic doors in a reasonably safe condition, and the fact that the nurse's actions caused the injury does not necessarily mean that the hospital is not responsible for the initial accident.\n\nIn conclusion, the court should deny the hospital's motion for summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to trial. The patient has not produced sufficient evidence to establish that the hospital was negligent, and the hospital's argument that the accident was due to the nurse's actions is not sufficient to grant summary judgment.",
