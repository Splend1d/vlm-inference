The motorist was 60 percent negligent, and the pedestrian was 40 percent at fault. Therefore, the motorist's negligence was greater than the pedestrian's.\n\nThe jury found that the pedestrian suffered damages totaling $50,000. The pedestrian's insurance company paid $10,000 of her medical expenses. Therefore, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence is $50,000 - $10,000 = $40,000.\n\nSince the motorist's negligence was found to be 60 percent, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence is 60 percent of $40,000, or $24,000. However, the court must disregard the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses under the collateral source rule. Therefore, the court should enter a judgment for the pedestrian in the amount of $30,000 ($24,000 x 0.75) to account for the payment of $10,000 by the pedestrian's insurance company.",
