This statement suggests that there might be a correlation between the size of the appendix and the number of offspring an individual leaves, which could be related to other factors such as overall health or fitness. This would not support the idea that the appendix is a vestigial organ, which is typically defined as an organ that no longer serves a functional purpose in the modern organism.",
