The force Ike used was not excessive.\nD. He had no intention of injuring Jack, only to stop his beating of Billy.\n\nassistant:Ike's best defense is that he thought Jack was the initial aggressor. This means that he believed Jack started the fight and that's why he stepped in to stop it. This is called self-defense, which allows someone to use force to protect themselves from harm. So, even though Ike accidentally hurt Jack, he was trying to protect Billy from Jack, who was the one who started the fight.",
