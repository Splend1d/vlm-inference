Environmental conservation\n\nassistant:The \"revolutions\" spoken of by Sukarno in the passage above most likely relate to the cause of decolonization. In the passage, Sukarno emphasizes the importance of preserving peace and independence for Asia and Africa. He also mentions the need for rehabilitation and upbuilding of their countries, which implies that they are seeking independence from colonial rule. The phrase \"Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course\" suggests that these countries are engaged in a struggle for independence and freedom. Therefore, the most likely cause of the \"revolutions\" mentioned in the passage is decolonization.",
