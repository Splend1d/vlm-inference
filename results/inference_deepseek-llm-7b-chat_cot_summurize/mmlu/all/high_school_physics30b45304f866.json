Immediately after the collision, the carts each have the same ______ as each other.\n\nA. Velocity\nB. Kinetic energy\nC. Mass\nD. Linear momentum\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Linear momentum.\n\nAfter the collision, the two carts have equal velocities and kinetic energies, but their masses are the same before and after the collision, so they do not change. However, their linear momenta do change because they stick together and form a single system.\n\nBefore the collision, the total linear momentum of the two carts was 1.5 kg * 3 m/s + 0.5 kg * 0.0 m/s = 4.5 kg * m/s.\nAfter the collision, the total linear momentum of the two carts is still 4.5 kg * m/s, but now it is distributed between the two carts, with each cart having 2.25 kg * m/s.\n\nTherefore, the two carts each have the same linear momentum as each other after the collision.",
