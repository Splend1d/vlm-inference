You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Primary motor cortex activity results in\n\nA. bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles.\nB. bilateral contraction of limb musculature.\nC. contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.\nD. contraction of contralateral limb musculature.\n\nassistant:The primary motor cortex is responsible for the planning and execution of voluntary movements. When the primary motor cortex is active, it sends signals to the muscles in the body, causing them to contract. This contraction is typically ipsilateral, meaning it occurs on the same side as the part of the body being moved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.",
