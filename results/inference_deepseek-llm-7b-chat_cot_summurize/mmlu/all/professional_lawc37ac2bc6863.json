A neighbor, an adjoining land owner, started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling of sand, rocks, dirt, and other materials on his property. The neighbor's excessive excavating in the course of conducting his sand removal business causes the collapse of a large storage building on the musician's property. If the musician brings an action to recover damages for the collapse of his storage building, the musician will probably\n\nA. be successful if he can prove that the neighbor was negligent in his excavations.\nB. be successful, because the neighbor would be strictly liable for his removal of lateral support.\nC. not be successful, because the neighbor could not be held liable for damage to an artificial structure such as a storage building.\nD. not be successful, because an adjacent land owner is under no affirmative duty to laterally support his neighbor's land.\n\nassistant:The musician may be successful in recovering damages for the collapse of his storage building if he can prove that the neighbor was negligent in his excavations. Negligence is the failure to exercise proper care or the breach of a duty of care. If the neighbor's excavations were conducted in a manner that a reasonably careful person would not have done, and this caused the collapse of the storage building, the musician may be able to establish that the neighbor was negligent.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, an adjacent landowner may be strictly liable for damage to an artificial structure such as a storage building if the damage is caused by the removal of lateral support. However, this is not always the case, and it depends on the specific circumstances of the case.\n\nIn general, an adjacent landowner is not under an affirmative duty to laterally support his neighbor's land. Therefore, if the collapse of the storage building was due to a failure of the musician's own support systems, the neighbor would not be liable.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is A. The musician will probably be successful if he can prove that the neighbor was negligent in his excavations.",
