False, False\n\nStatement 1 is false. The logistic regression model can yield a single global optimum, not multiple local optimums. This is because logistic regression is a non-parametric method that does not have the assumption that the data follows a particular distribution.\n\nStatement 2 is false. This statement is a common myth about naive Bayes classifiers. While naive Bayes classifiers are powerful and effective, they do not always perform the best compared to other classifiers, especially when the distribution of the data is unknown or the data is highly complex.",
