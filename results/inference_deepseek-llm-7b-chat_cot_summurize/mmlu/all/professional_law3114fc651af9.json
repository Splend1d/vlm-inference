Under its enumerated powers, Congress may legislate to preserve the monopoly of the national government over the conduct of U.S. foreign affairs. This power is granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which states that Congress shall have the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\" This power gives Congress the authority to set rules and regulations for how the U.S. conducts its foreign affairs, and this includes making laws to prohibit citizens from engaging in certain activities that could interfere with or influence the conduct of foreign affairs. Therefore, it is within Congress's power to pass a law like the one in question that makes it a federal crime for a citizen to negotiate with a foreign government for the purpose of influencing the foreign government in relation to a dispute with the U.S. without being specifically authorized by the President.",
