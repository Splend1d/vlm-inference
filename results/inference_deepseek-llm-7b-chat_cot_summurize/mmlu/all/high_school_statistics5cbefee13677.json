Small sample size and 95% confidence\nB. Small sample size and 99% confidence\nC. Large sample size and 95% confidence\nD. Large sample size and 99% confidence\n\nassistant:To determine which option would result in the narrowest confidence interval, we need to compare the effect of a small sample size with a large sample size.\n\nA small sample size of n=100 and a 95% confidence level would result in a confidence interval of approximately 1.96 standard errors. This is because the standard error decreases as the sample size increases.\n\nA small sample size of n=100 and a 99% confidence level would result in a confidence interval of approximately 2.58 standard errors. This is because the standard error decreases as the sample size increases, but the confidence level decreases from 95% to 99% means that the standard error increases as well.\n\nA large sample size of n=1000 and a 95% confidence level would result in a confidence interval of approximately 0.957 standard errors. This is because the standard error decreases as the sample size increases.\n\nA large sample size of n=1000 and a 99% confidence level would result in a confidence interval of approximately 1.272 standard errors. This is because the standard error decreases as the sample size increases, but the confidence level decreases from 95% to 99% means that the standard error increases as well.\n\nTherefore, the narrowest confidence interval would be obtained with a large sample size of n=1000 and a 95% confidence level, which has approximately 0.957 standard errors.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Large sample size and 95% confidence.",
