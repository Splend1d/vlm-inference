Natural Law Theory.\n\nAquinas's moral theory is indeed a version of natural law theory. Thomas Aquinas, a medieval philosopher, was heavily influenced by both Aristotle and the Bible. He believed that the natural law, which can be found within the human heart, serves as a guide for moral decision-making.\n\nIn the context of this question, the other options can be explained as follows:\n\nA. Consequentialism: This moral theory focuses on the outcome or consequences of an action, arguing that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the resulting outcomes. While Aquinas's theory has some elements of consequentialism, it is not his primary focus.\n\nC. Rights-based theory: This theory asserts that individuals have certain inalienable rights that should be protected by society. Aquinas's moral theory does not focus on the concept of individual rights.\n\nD. Virtue Ethics: This approach to ethics emphasizes the development of virtues, or moral character traits, as the primary means of achieving moral excellence. Aquinas's moral theory does not primarily focus on the development of virtues.",
