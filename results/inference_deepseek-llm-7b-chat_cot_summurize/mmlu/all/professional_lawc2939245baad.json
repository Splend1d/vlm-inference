The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis is because the resident is claiming that the high fees at the hotel operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits any state or government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In this case, the resident is arguing that the high fees at the hotel are a form of discrimination against the poor, and that this violates their right to equal protection under the law.",
