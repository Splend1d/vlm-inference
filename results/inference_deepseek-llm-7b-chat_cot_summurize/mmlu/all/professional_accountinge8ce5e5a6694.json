Not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety. This is because Royal is the primary obligee, and if Royal is adjudicated mentally incompetent, their liability on the note is discharged. Since Brown cosigned the note as a surety, their liability would also be discharged due to Royal's incompetency.",
