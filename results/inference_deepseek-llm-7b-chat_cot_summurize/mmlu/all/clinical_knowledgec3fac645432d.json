DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase.\nD. chromatin, DNA and amino acids.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase.\n\nTranslation is the process by which genetic information stored in DNA is used to create proteins. This process takes place in the cytoplasm of a cell and requires the presence of three main components:\n\n1. mRNA: Messenger RNA is a single-stranded molecule that carries the genetic instructions from the DNA template to the ribosomes. It is synthesized from the DNA template by RNA polymerase.\n2. Ribosomes: These are the cellular organelles responsible for the decoding of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins. Ribosomes are made up of RNA and proteins, and they are the site of protein synthesis in the cell.\n3. RNA polymerase: This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of mRNA from the DNA template. It is the key enzyme involved in the process of translation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase.",
