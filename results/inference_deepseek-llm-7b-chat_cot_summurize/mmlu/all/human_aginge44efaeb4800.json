Delirium\nB. MCI\nC. Dementia\nD. Pick's\n\nassistant:The disorder referred to as irreversible damage to the brain and increasing is called Dementia. Dementia is a broad term that refers to a decline in cognitive ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. It is caused by damage to brain cells and the connections between them, which can be due to a variety of factors such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular disease, or head trauma.\n\nMCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) is a condition in which a person experiences mild cognitive decline, but not enough to interfere with their daily life. It is considered a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia.\n\nDelirium is a more acute form of cognitive impairment that can occur suddenly and is often a response to an underlying medical condition.\n\nPick's disease is a specific type of dementia that is caused by the build-up of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.",
