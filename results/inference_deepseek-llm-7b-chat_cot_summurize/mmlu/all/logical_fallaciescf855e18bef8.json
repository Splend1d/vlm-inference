This fallacy occurs when a claim is made that is based on a single example or case, but is then extended to apply to a broader group or set of cases.\n\nOption A is not a correct description of the fallacy of extension. The fallacy of division, which is similar to the fallacy of extension, does involve asking a question that includes an unproven assumption or more than one question, but the fallacy of extension is not the same thing.\n\nOption B is also not a correct description of the fallacy of extension. The fallacy of circular reasoning, which is a type of logical fallacy that involves using the conclusion as the basis for the argument, is a different fallacy and not the same as the fallacy of extension.\n\nOption C is not a correct description of the fallacy of extension. The fallacy of non sequitur, which is a type of logical fallacy that involves making a conclusion that does not logically follow from the premises, is a different fallacy and not the same as the fallacy of extension.\n\nOption D is a correct description of the fallacy of extension. The fallacy of extension occurs when a single case or example is used as if it were a general rule or principle, and therefore all the claims in the proposition are treated as if they have been proven.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
