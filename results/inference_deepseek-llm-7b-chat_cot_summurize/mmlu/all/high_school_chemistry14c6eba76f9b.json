The reaction rate is found to triple. The appropriate exponent for A in the rate law is\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. 4\n\nassistant:The appropriate exponent for A in the rate law is 3.\n\nThe given information states that when the concentration of reactant A is tripled, the reaction rate triples as well. This suggests that the rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of reactant A raised to the power of 3. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nrate = k[A]^3\n\nwhere rate is the reaction rate, [A] is the concentration of reactant A, and k is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the exponent for A in the rate law is 3.",
