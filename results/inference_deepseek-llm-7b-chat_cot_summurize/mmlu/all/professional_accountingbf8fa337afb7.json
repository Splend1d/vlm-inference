Spark pays a sales commission of $25 per phone sold and monthly fixed costs are $3000. Assuming Spark desired a profit of 10% of sales how many units must Spark sell?\n\nA. 600\nB. 400\nC. 200\nD. 100\n\nassistant:To find the number of units Spark Co. must sell to achieve a 10% profit, we need to calculate the total cost of goods sold (COGS) and fixed costs, and then find the gross profit from sales.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the gross profit per unit:\nGross profit per unit = Selling price - COGS per unit - Sales commission\nGross profit per unit = $200 - ($125 + $25) - $25 = $200 - $150 - $25 = $25\n\nNext, let's calculate the desired profit percentage:\nDesired profit percentage = 10% = 0.10\n\nNow, we can set up the equation for the total desired profit:\nTotal desired profit = Number of units * Gross profit per unit\nTotal desired profit = Number of units * $25\n\nWe know that the desired profit is equal to 10% of sales, which can be expressed as:\nDesired profit = 0.10 * Total sales\n\nWe can also express the total sales as:\nTotal sales = Number of units * Selling price per unit\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for total desired profit and total sales into the equation for total desired profit:\n0.10 * (Number of units * $200) = Number of units * $25\n\nSolving for Number of units:\nNumber of units * 0.10 * $200 = $25\nNumber of units = $25 / (0.10 * $200)\n\nNumber of units = $25 / $20\nNumber of units = 1.25\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a unit, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2. Therefore, Spark Co. must sell 2 units to achieve a 10% profit.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 200.",
