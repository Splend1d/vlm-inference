In accord with the serial position curve, which of the following words is the participant most likely to forget?\n\nA. House\nB. Computer\nC. Flower\nD. License\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to consider the serial position effect, which states that the first and last items in a list are more likely to be remembered than the middle items. In this case, the first item is \"house,\" and the last item is \"salad.\" Therefore, the participant is most likely to forget the middle item, which is \"water.\" So the correct answer is D.
