A client takes the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends.\n\nExplanation: The other options may impair objectivity, integrity, or independence with respect to an audit client.\n\nA. An auditor taking the client\u2019s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend could potentially impair objectivity if the auditor is spending excessive time with the client and may not have enough time to work on other engagements.\n\nB. An out-of-town client taking the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant is generally not a problem, as long as the auditor maintains professional boundaries and does not accept any other gifts or favors from the client.\n\nC. An auditor providing client management with box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise could potentially impair objectivity if the auditor is providing a benefit to the client in exchange for favorable treatment during the audit.\n\nD. A client taking the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends is the least likely to impair objectivity, integrity, or independence. The audit team has already worked for two consecutive weekends and the client is showing appreciation by taking them on a trip.",
