The defendant's criminal liability was superseded by that of the truck driver.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The defendant was suffering from temporary insanity.\n\nThe criminal statute mentioned by the user states that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of the conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, they lack substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of their conduct, or to conform their conduct to the requirements of law.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant was so shocked when he saw his nephew fall near the garbage truck that he froze and was unable to move until it was too late. This reaction can be considered a mental disease or defect that resulted in the defendant lacking substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\n\nTherefore, if the jury believes the testimony of the defendant and his expert witness, the defendant's best defense is that he was suffering from temporary insanity, which would mean that he was not responsible for his actions at the time of the incident.",
