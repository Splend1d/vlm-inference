Under the relevant state statute, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of one year in jail and/or a fine of $500. At trial, the defendant pleaded not guilty and requested that an attorney be appointed to represent him. The trial judge refused to honor the defendant's request for an attorney. If the defendant is subsequently found guilty, which of the following is the most severe sentence that can constitutionally be imposed?\n\nA. A $500 fine.\nB. Six months in jail.\nC. One year in jail.\nD. No sentence, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\n\nassistant:The most severe sentence that can constitutionally be imposed in this case would be D. No sentence, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. Since the trial judge refused to appoint an attorney for the defendant, the defendant was denied this right. Therefore, no sentence can be imposed on the defendant, as they were not able to receive a fair trial.\n\nA $500 fine would be the least severe sentence, as it is a monetary penalty rather than a jail sentence. Six months in jail or one year in jail would be more severe sentences, but they would be unconstitutional in this case because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.",
