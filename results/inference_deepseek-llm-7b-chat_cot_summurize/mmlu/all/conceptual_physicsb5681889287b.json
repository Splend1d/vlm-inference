All of these.\n\nassistant:B. volume of fluid.\n\nA completely submerged object always displaces its own volume of fluid. The object's volume is equal to the volume of the fluid it displaces, which is why the object can float or sink in the fluid. The object's weight is not affected by its position in the fluid, so the object displaces its weight of fluid. The object's density is related to its volume and weight, but the question is asking about the displacement of fluid, not the object's density.",
