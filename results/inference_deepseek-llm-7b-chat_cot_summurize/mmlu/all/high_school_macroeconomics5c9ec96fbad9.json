Recessions are periods of economic decline, and full employment refers to the situation when there are no unemployed people who are actively looking for jobs.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options\nA. Falling wages and prices: This option suggests that wages and prices would decrease, which could help people afford more goods and services. However, this might also lead to reduced demand and further contraction of the economy, making it harder for an economy to return to full employment.\nB. Rising wages and prices: This option implies that wages and prices would increase. This could help people's purchasing power, but it might also lead to inflation, which can be detrimental to the economy.\nC. Expansionary monetary policy: This option suggests that the central bank would use monetary policy tools to increase the money supply and stimulate the economy. Expansionary monetary policy can help an economy to recover from a recession, but it might also lead to inflation.\nD. Increased government spending: This option implies that the government would increase its spending to boost the economy. Increased government spending can help to stimulate the economy and create jobs, which could contribute to the recovery from a recession and the return to full employment.\n\nStep 3: Choose the most accurate answer\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer would be D. Increased government spending, as it aligns with Classical analysis and is likely to have a positive impact on the economy during a recession.",
