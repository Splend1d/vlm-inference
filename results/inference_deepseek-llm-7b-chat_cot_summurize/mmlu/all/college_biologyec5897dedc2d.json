High niche divergence among co-occurring species\nB. High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass\nC. High frequency of K-selected species\nD. High detrital biomass\n\nassistant:B. High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass is predicted for an early-successional plant community.\n\nEarly-successional plant communities are characterized by rapid growth and succession, and they are often characterized by high rates of primary production. This is because early-successional communities are often dominated by pioneer species that can quickly establish themselves in disturbed or recently-deforested areas. These pioneer species are able to capture sunlight and convert it into biomass at a high rate, leading to high ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass.\n\nA. High niche divergence among co-occurring species is not necessarily a characteristic of an early-successional plant community. While diversity of species can be high in early-successional communities, the niche differentiation among co-occurring species may not be as pronounced as in more mature plant communities.\n\nC. High frequency of K-selected species is not a characteristic of an early-successional plant community. K-selected species are those that grow slowly and mature late, and they are more common in mature plant communities. Early-successional communities are dominated by species that grow quickly and mature early, so the frequency of K-selected species is typically low.\n\nD. High detrital biomass is not a characteristic of an early-successional plant community. Detritus is organic matter that has been broken down and accumulated on the soil surface, and it is typically associated with mature plant communities. Early-successional communities are characterized by rapid growth and succession, and they do not accumulate as much detrital biomass as mature plant communities.",
