Al(NO3)3(s) \u2192 Al3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)\nD. 2Ag+(aq) + Ti(s) \u2192 2Ag(s) + Ti2+(aq)\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Al(NO3)3(s) \u2192 Al3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq).\n\nThis reaction is an example of a double displacement reaction, which is an irreversible reaction. In this reaction, aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3) reacts with sodium metal to form aluminum (Al), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and sodium (Na). The sodium ions (Na+) and nitrate ions (NO3-) switch places, which is why it is called a double displacement reaction. This reaction is irreversible because the reactants have been completely converted into products, and the products cannot be reversed back into the reactants.\n\nThe other reactions are not irreversible:\n\nA. CH4(g) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(l) is an example of a combustion reaction, which is an exothermic reaction that releases energy. It is not an irreversible reaction because the reactants can be reversed back into the products by providing more heat or oxygen.\n\nB. HCN(aq) + H2O(l) \u2192 CN-(aq) + H3O+(aq) is an example of a nucleophilic substitution reaction, which is an reversible reaction. In this reaction, hydrogen cyanide reacts with water to form cyanic acid and hydroxide ions. The products can be converted back into the reactants by providing more HCN or H2O.\n\nD. 2Ag+(aq) + Ti(s) \u2192 2Ag(s) + Ti2+(aq) is an example of a displacement reaction, which is also a reversible reaction. In this reaction, silver ions react with titanium to form silver metal and titanium ions. The products can be converted back into the reactants by providing more silver or titanium.",
