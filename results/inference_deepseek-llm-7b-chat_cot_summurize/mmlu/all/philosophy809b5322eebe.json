However, it is not directly related to Kantian, Aristotelian, or absolutist or relativist views. Therefore, the answer cannot be directly inferred from her work.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, I would need more information about the context of the question and Nussbaum's specific contributions to the field of cross-cultural communication.\n\nPlease provide more information about the context and Nussbaum's work, so I can assist you better.",
