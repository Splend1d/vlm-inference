Khipu\nB. Mit'a\nC. Split inheritance\nD. Capacocha\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Mit'a.\n\nThe required labor service owed to the Incan king was called Mit'a. It was a system of forced labor that required the people to work on the construction of roads, temples, and other public works in exchange for the privilege of using the land. The labor service was usually performed by the men of the community, and it was carried out for a period of three years. During this time, the men were required to work for six months and then take a month off.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Khipu: A khipu is a type of knot used by the Incas to record information. It is not related to the required labor service owed to the king.\n\nC. Split inheritance: This refers to the practice of dividing inheritance equally among multiple heirs. It is not related to the required labor service owed to the Incan king.\n\nD. Capacocha: This is a Quechuan word that means \"master builder\" or \"chief architect.\" It is not related to the required labor service owed to the Incan king.",
