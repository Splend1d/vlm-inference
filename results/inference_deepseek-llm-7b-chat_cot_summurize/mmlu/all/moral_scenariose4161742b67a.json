Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character turns off the music when their neighbors complain about the noise. This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It is a reasonable and considerate response to a neighborly complaint.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character refuses to lend their sister their hairbrush because they have lice. While it may be inconvenient for the sister, it is not morally wrong for the main character to prioritize their own health and well-being. Losing a hairbrush is not a serious moral issue.",
