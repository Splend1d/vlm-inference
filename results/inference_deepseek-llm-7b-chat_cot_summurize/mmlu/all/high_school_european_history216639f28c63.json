This is indicated in the statement \"Writings which do not belong to one of the above-mentioned classes shall be treated according to the laws now in force, or which may be enacted, in the individual states of the union. . . . Each state of the union is responsible, not only to the state against which the offense is directly committed, but to the whole Confederation, for every publication appearing under its supervision in which the honor or security of other states is infringed or their constitution or administration attacked.\" This fear of the spread of liberal ideas was a reaction to the growing influence of liberalism and nationalism in Germany during this time period, and the German states sought to limit the spread of these ideas in order to maintain control and stability within their confederation.",
