Therefore, the correct answer is option D. Descartes' argument for this idea is found in the \"Meditation on First Philosophy,\" where he proposes that physical objects have extension because they can fill space and occupy different positions. This idea is also reflected in his concept of \"extension\" as a fundamental attribute of physical substance.",
