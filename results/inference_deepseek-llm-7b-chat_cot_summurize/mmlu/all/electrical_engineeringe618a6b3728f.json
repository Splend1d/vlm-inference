DC only\nB. AC only\nC. Either AC or DC\nD. An Impulse\n\nassistant:The superposition theorem states that the current or voltage in an electrical network is equal to the sum of the currents or voltages produced by each individual element in the circuit when no external forces are acting on the circuit.\n\nGiven that all the elements in the network are linear, this means that the current or voltage in each element is directly proportional to the amplitude of the driving force applied. In other words, if the driving force is increased, the current or voltage in the element will also increase, and vice versa.\n\nThe superposition theorem applies when the excitation is either AC or DC. It does not specifically apply to DC only or to impulses. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Either AC or DC.",
