Eventually, Jacob's mother gives in and lets him choose one candy item to buy if he stops crying. Jacob's crying behavior is __________________ by his mother.\n\nA. punished\nB. associated\nC. reinforced\nD. extinguished\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. reinforced.\n\nJacob's crying behavior is being reinforced by his mother because she gives in and lets him choose one candy item to buy when he stops crying. This means that his crying behavior is being encouraged by the desired outcome, which is him being able to buy candy.\n\nOption A, punished, is incorrect because there is no punishment being given to Jacob. Option B, associated, is incorrect because the association is between stopping crying and getting candy, not between the crying and any other event or object. Option D, extinguished, is incorrect because there is no indication that his mother is trying to stop his crying behavior.",
