Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.\nD.

Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.\n\nThe store owner's defense is based on the idea that the video should not be considered obscene because it consists only of pictures of nude sunbathers on a beach in a foreign country where nude public sunbathing is common. Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the store owner has the right to freedom of speech. The prosecution's argument that the video violates the anti-obscenity law is not sufficient to overcome this defense. Mere portrayals of nudity, without more, are not enough to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.\n\nTherefore, the store owner should prevail in this defense.",
