This is because the egg only remains viable for a short period of time, and sperm can only survive for a few days after ejaculation. Therefore, if sexual intercourse occurs within the few days leading up to ovulation, there is a good chance that the sperm will meet the egg and fertilize it. After this time, the egg is no longer viable and cannot be fertilized.",
