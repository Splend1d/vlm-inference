In this context, it is not refuted by moral requirements, replaced by them, or irrelevant to morality. Instead, deliberative justification is seen as a way to help individuals make more informed and responsible decisions by considering the moral implications of their actions.\n\nDeliberative justification is not necessarily in conflict with moral requirements, but rather complements them. By carefully considering the moral reasons for a particular action, an individual can make a more informed decision that aligns with the moral requirements they acknowledge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. is replaced once we acknowledge moral requirements.",
