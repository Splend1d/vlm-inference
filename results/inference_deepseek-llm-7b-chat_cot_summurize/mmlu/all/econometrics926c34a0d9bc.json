Which of the following conditions must hold for it to be said that there is bi-directional feedback?\n\nA. The b and d coefficients significant and the a and c coefficients insignificant\nB. The a and c coefficients significant and the b and d coefficients insignificant\nC. The a and c coefficients significant\nD. The b and d coefficients significant\n\nassistant:To determine which of the following conditions must hold for bi-directional feedback, we need to look at the coefficients of the VAR model. The VAR model is given by:\n\nyt+1 = Ayt + bXt+1 + dUt+1 + e(yt+1)\n\nwhere yt+1 is the output of the VAR model at time t+1, yt is the output at time t, X is a matrix of exogenous variables, A is a matrix of coefficients, d is a matrix of coefficients for the lagged variables, and e is the error term.\n\nBi-directional feedback occurs when there is a relationship between yt and yt-1. This means that the coefficients for the lagged variables d have to be significant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The b and d coefficients significant.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a simplified explanation, and in practice, the interpretation of bi-directional feedback can be more complex and depends on the specific context and structure of the VAR model.",
