The defendant was arrested after allegedly trying to purchase several kilos of heroin from an undercover government agent. At trial, the undercover agent testified about the defendant's efforts to arrange the drug transaction. The defendant's defense, on the other hand, consisted entirely in attacking the undercover agent's credibility. During his summation, the prosecuting attorney, over defendant's objections, stated that he had produced the only witness who was willing to take the stand and testify to what occurred at the meeting when the undercover agent arrested the defendant. Based on the undercover agent's uncontradicted testimony, the prosecuting attorney urged the jury to convict the defendant. The defendant was convicted and, on appeal, argued that the judge erred in permitting the prosecutor's statement. The defendant's conviction should be\n\nA. reversed, because the prosecutor's remarks constituted improper comment about the defendant's right to testify.\nB. reversed, because the prosecutor's remarks were not proper rebuttal to defense attacks on the undercover agent's credibility.\nC. affirmed, because it is immaterial; the probative value of the defendant's failure to testify is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. affirmed, because the prosecutor had the right to express the strength of the evidence he had pursued.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. reversed, because the prosecutor's remarks were not proper rebuttal to defense attacks on the undercover agent's credibility.\n\nThe prosecutor's statement in this case was improper for two reasons. First, the statement was not a proper rebuttal to the defendant's attacks on the undercover agent's credibility. The defendant's defense focused on attacking the undercover agent's credibility, and the prosecutor's statement did not directly address those attacks. Instead, the prosecutor's statement was a comment on the defendant's right to testify, which is not relevant to the credibility of the undercover agent.\n\nSecond, the statement was not necessary to rebut the defendant's argument that the undercover agent's testimony was not credible. The prosecutor could have rebutted the defendant's argument by presenting additional evidence or testimony from other witnesses who could attest to the undercover agent's credibility. The statement the prosecutor made was not necessary to prove the defendant's guilt, and therefore it was not proper rebuttal to the defense's argument.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the prosecutor's statement did not constitute improper comment about the defendant's right to testify. The defendant's right to testify was not at issue in this case, and the prosecutor's statement was not a comment on that right.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the probative value of the defendant's failure to testify is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The defendant's failure to testify may be relevant to the credibility of the undercover agent, and the jury may draw an adverse inference from the defendant's failure to testify.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the prosecutor did not have the right to express the strength of the evidence he had pursued. The prosecutor's statement was not a proper rebuttal to the defense's arguments, and it was not necessary to prove the defendant's guilt.",
