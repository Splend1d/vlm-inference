It was built between A.D. 900 and 1400 and was the largest pre-Columbian city in North America. The city contained more than 120 earthen mounds, which were primarily used as burial sites. The population of Cahokia is estimated to have been around 10,000.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the number of burial mounds is much lower than the actual number of earthen mounds. Option C is incorrect because the number of religious monuments is much lower than the actual number of earthen mounds. Option D is incorrect because the number of pyramidal mounds is much lower than the actual number of earthen mounds, and the population is much higher than the estimated 10,000.",
