Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.\nB. Dopamine and acetyl choline.\nC. Glutamate and serotonin.\nD. Dopamine and serotonin.\n\nassistant:The answer is D. Dopamine and serotonin.\n\nPharmacological agents that influence fatigue development by altering the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain include dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is involved in the regulation of movement, motivation, and reward, while serotonin is involved in mood regulation and sleep. Reductions in these neurotransmitter levels have been associated with fatigue development.",
