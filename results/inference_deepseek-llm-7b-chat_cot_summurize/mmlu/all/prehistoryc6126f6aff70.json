The Miocene was a time of significant climatic and environmental changes, including a shift in the distribution of flora and fauna, as well as an increase in volcanic activity. These changes made it difficult for ape species to adapt and survive, leading to their eventual extinction.\n\nWhile humans, asteroids, and dinosaurs may have played a role in the extinction of some species, it was the changing environment that was the primary factor. As the world around them changed, ape species were unable to adapt quickly enough to survive, and many went extinct.",
