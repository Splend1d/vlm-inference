Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character who does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 1 is the one who repeatedly and intentionally stomped on the other person's toes during the line dance. This action is considered morally wrong as it involves causing harm to another person, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character who reads their parents' contacts is engaging in an act of privacy invasion, which can be seen as morally questionable. However, it may not necessarily be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it depends on the context and the reasons behind the action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
