Personal immunity is afforded to all physical persons\nB. Personal immunity is that which is afforded in a personal capacity and hence does not cover conduct of the State as such\nC. Personal immunity is afforded only to particular persons irrespective if their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity\nD. Personal immunity is afforded to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity\n\nassistant:Personal immunity refers to the protection from legal liability that certain individuals or entities receive for actions taken in their personal capacities, as opposed to actions taken in their official capacities. This protection is typically afforded to individuals who are not acting within the scope of their employment or official duties, but rather are acting in their individual capacity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because personal immunity is not a blanket protection afforded to all physical persons. Instead, it is specific to certain individuals or entities based on the circumstances of their actions.\n\nOption B is partially correct. Personal immunity does protect individuals from liability for actions taken in their personal capacity, but it does not necessarily exclude liability for actions taken in a public capacity.\n\nOption C is correct. Personal immunity is specifically afforded to certain individuals, regardless of whether their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because personal immunity is not typically afforded to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity. Instead, such officials may be subject to liability for actions taken in their official capacity.",
