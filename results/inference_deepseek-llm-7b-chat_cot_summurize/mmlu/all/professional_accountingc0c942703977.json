In year 4 Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock. In year 5 the stock split 2-for-1. In the current year Lemon sold 800 shares. What is Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold?\n\nA. $4,000\nB. $8,000\nC. $8,400\nD. 16800\n\nassistant:To calculate Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold, we need to consider the initial investment, the dividend, and the stock split.\n\n1. Initial investment: Lemon purchased 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The total cost of the initial investment is 2000 \\* $10.50 = $21,000.\n\n2. Dividend: In year 4, Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock. The number of shares received as a result of the dividend is 5% of the 2000 shares, or 0.05 \\* 2000 = 100 shares. The value of these shares is 100 \\* $10.50 = $1,050.\n\n3. Stock split: In year 5, the stock split 2-for-1. This means that the value of each share is divided by 2, so the value of each share after the split is $10.50 / 2 = $5.25.\n\nNow we can calculate Lemon's basis in the 800 shares sold:\n- Lemon owned 2000 shares in year 1 at a cost of $21,000.\n- After the stock split in year 5, the value of each share is $5.25.\n- In the current year, Lemon sold 800 shares, which means they received $5.25 \\* 800 = $4,180 in proceeds from the sale.\n\nTo calculate Lemon's basis in the 800 shares sold, we need to subtract the proceeds from the sale from the initial investment and the dividend.\n- Initial investment: $21,000\n- Dividend: $1,050\n- Proceeds from the sale: $4,180\n- Lemon's basis: $21,000 + $1,050 + $4,180 = $26,230\n\nNone of the given options match the correct answer, which is $26,230.",
