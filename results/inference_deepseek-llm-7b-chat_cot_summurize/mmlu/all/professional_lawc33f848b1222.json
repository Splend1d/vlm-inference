Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.\n\nIn this case, the man did take the female guest's property (purse and jewelry) without her consent and while she was unconscious. This falls under the definition of robbery, which is the unlawful taking of property from another's person by intimidation or force. Since there was no intimidation or force used in this case, the man can still be convicted of robbery, as it does not require the victim to be subdued by force or be placed in fear.",
