They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\n\nEnzymes are effective in facilitating chemical reactions because they lower the activation energy required for a reaction to proceed. Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to start and continue. By lowering this energy, enzymes make it easier for a reaction to occur, thus speeding it up. This is known as the enzyme's catalytic effect.",
