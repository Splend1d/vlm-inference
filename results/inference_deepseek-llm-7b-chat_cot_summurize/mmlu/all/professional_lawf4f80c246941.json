The landlord's notice to terminate was improper, because it was given to the tenant more than one month before the required termination date. The lease agreement between the landlord and the tenant is on a month-to-month basis, and the landlord served the tenant with a written but not notarized notice to terminate the tenancy and vacate the apartment on or before June 30. However, the landlord sued the tenant for possession immediately following the court order in the tenant's favor on May 7, which means the tenant could still be in possession of the apartment on May 7, as nothing had changed. Therefore, the landlord's notice to terminate was given more than one month before the required termination date, making it improper and invalid. This is the reason why the tenant was still in possession, and the landlord's action for possession was unsuccessful.",
