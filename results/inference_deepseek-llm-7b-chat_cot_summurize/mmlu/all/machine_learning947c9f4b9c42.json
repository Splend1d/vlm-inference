False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Overfitting is more likely when the set of training data is small. This statement is true. When the set of training data is small, the model may not be able to generalize well to new data, leading to overfitting.\n\nStatement 2: Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small. This statement is false. The size of the hypothesis space refers to the number of possible models that can be learned by the model, not the amount of training data. Overfitting is more likely when the model has a large and complex hypothesis space, but the size of the training data does not directly affect this.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
