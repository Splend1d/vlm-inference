So, we can use the valuation E (True) and F (True) and G (Unknown).\n\n(~E \u2228 F):\n~E means \"not E,\" so ~E \u2228 F means \"either not E or F.\" Since E is true, this proposition becomes T \u2228 T, which is true. We can use the valuation ~E (False) and F (True) for this proposition.\n\nH \u2228 I:\nThis proposition is given as (~E \u2228 F), so H and I are not defined. We cannot use any valuation for this proposition.\n\nI \u2283 (J \u2283 ~H):\nI is not defined, and J \u2283 ~H means \"if J, then not H.\" Since we don't have any valuations for I, J, or H, we cannot use this proposition to determine consistency.\n\n~G \u2283 ~J:\n~G means \"not G,\" and ~J means \"not J.\" We can use the valuation ~G (True) and ~J (True) to evaluate this proposition. Since both ~G and ~J are true, the proposition becomes T \u2283 T, which is false.\n\nNow let's analyze the propositions:\n\n1. (E \u2283 F) \u2283 G: True \u2228 True \u2283 Unknown\n2.
