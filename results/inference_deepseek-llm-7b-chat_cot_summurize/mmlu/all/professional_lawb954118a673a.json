The landlord leased the building and the surrounding property to a tenant for a term of six years, commencing on December 1, 2003 and terminating on November 30, 2009.

The lease agreement requires the tenant to pay rent regardless of the circumstances that render the property uninhabitable. Therefore, the tenant is still liable for the rent even though the property is uninhabitable.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the covenant to pay rent runs with the land, not the tenant. The covenant is a part of the lease agreement between the landlord and the tenant, and the tenant is obligated to pay the rent even if the property is rendered uninhabitable.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it would be inequitable to enforce the rental provision in the lease agreement due to the fire. The tenant is not responsible for the fire and therefore should not be held liable for the unpaid rent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it refers to statutes that relieve a tenant of their obligation to pay rent where the premises are rendered uninhabitable by fire or other acts of God. However, this particular situation does not involve an act of God, but rather an incident that occurred during the lease term.",
