A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\n\nA. 0.24 mJ\nB. 0.38 mJ\nC. 0.48 mJ\nD. 0.75 mJ\n\nassistant:To find the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider both the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n\nThe kinetic energy (K) of the mass is equal to 0.040 m/s times the mass (0.30 kg) times the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), which is 0.040 \\* 0.30 \\* 9.81 = 0.040 \\* 2.943 = 0.147 mJ.\n\nThe potential energy (PE) of the system is equal to the spring's potential energy, which is equal to the spring's force (mass \\* acceleration) times the distance the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position. The spring's force is equal to the spring's force constant (k) times the displacement (0.030 m), which is 0.30 \\* 9.81 = 0.2943 mJ.\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is equal to the kinetic energy plus the potential energy, which is 0.147 + 0.2943 = 0.4423 mJ.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.48 mJ.",
