At trial, the defendant testified that a fellow fraternity member gave him the gun before the shooting and told him that it was unloaded. If the jury believes the defendant, it should find him\n\nA. guilty of assault, but not murder or manslaughter.\nB. guilty of manslaughter.\nC. guilty of second-degree murder.\nD. guilty of first-degree murder.\n\nassistant:This is a legal question that requires knowledge of the elements of murder in the first degree, second degree, and manslaughter. Based on the information provided, the defendant is charged with killing the student. To be found guilty of first-degree murder, the prosecution must prove that the defendant's actions were intentional and premeditated, with malice aforethought. Since the defendant testified that he believed the gun was unloaded, this would suggest that his actions were not premeditated or intentional, and therefore, he would not be guilty of first-degree murder.\n\nHowever, the statute also provides that murder in the second degree is any killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a serious or inherently dangerous felony. Since the defendant pulled the trigger, this suggests that he was committing or attempting to commit a serious or inherently dangerous felony, and therefore, he could be guilty of murder in the second degree.\n\nManslaughter includes all other types of unlawful homicide and unjustifiable killings. Since the defendant did not intend to kill the student, but the act of pulling the trigger resulted in the student's death, this could also be considered manslaughter.\n\nBased on this analysis, the defendant should be found guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Therefore, the answer is B. guilty of manslaughter.",
