If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nArranging the given data in ascending order: 8, 10, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35\n\nThere are 9 data points, which is an odd number, so the median is the middle value.\n\nThe middle value is 22.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 22.",
