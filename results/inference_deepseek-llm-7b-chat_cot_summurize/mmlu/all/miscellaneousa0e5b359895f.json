Hutu\nB. Zulu\nC. Aztec\nD. Masai\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Zulu.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Zulu Empire controlled large areas of South African territory. The Zulu Empire was a powerful kingdom in what is now southern Africa, centered on present-day KwaZulu-Natal province. It was established in the mid-19th century by King Shaka, who united various Zulu clans and expanded the empire through military conquests.\n\nThe empire reached its peak in the mid-19th century under King Cetshwayo, who defeated the British in the Battle of Isandlwana in 1879. However, the empire was eventually defeated in the Second Boer War, and the British annexed the territory and established the Natal Province.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Hutu: The Hutu are a group of ethnic groups in Rwanda and Burundi, not a historical empire that controlled South African territory.\nC. Aztec: The Aztec Empire was a pre-Columbian civilization in what is now Mexico, not South Africa.\nD. Masai: The Masai are a group of ethnic groups in East Africa, not a historical empire that controlled South African territory.",
