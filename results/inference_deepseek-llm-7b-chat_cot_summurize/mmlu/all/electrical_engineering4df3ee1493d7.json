For a load counter emf of 200 V, the range of firing angle control is\n\nA. 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\nB. 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\nC. 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.\nD. 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the range of firing angle control for a single phase one pulse controlled circuit with a load counter emf of 200 V.\n\nFirst, let's find the relationship between the load counter emf E and the source voltage V_s. Since the load counter emf is given as 400 sin(314t), we can rewrite it as 200 sin(314t) \\* R, where R is the resistance of the circuit.\n\nNow, we can use Ohm's law to find the relationship between the source voltage V_s and the load counter emf E. The resistance R can be expressed as V_s / E. Substituting this into the equation for E, we get:\n\nE = 200 sin(314t) \\* (V_s / E)\n\nNow, we can find the range of firing angle control by analyzing the relationship between the firing angle and the source voltage. The firing angle can be expressed as:\n\ntheta = arccos((V_s / E) / R)\n\nSubstituting the expression for E, we get:\n\ntheta = arccos((V_s / (200 sin(314t) \\* (V_s / E))) / R)\n\nNow, we can analyze the range of theta by finding the range of V_s for a given value of E. Since the load counter emf is given as 400 sin(314t), we can find the maximum and minimum values of E by taking the derivative of the sine function with respect to t and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndE/dt = 314 cos(314t)\n\nSetting dE/dt = 0, we get:\n\nt_max = 0\nt_min = 0\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding values of E_max and E_min by substituting these values of t back into the expression for E:\n\nE_max = 400 sin(314 \\* 0) = 0\nE_min = 400 sin(314 \\* 0) = 0\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding values of theta_max and theta_min by substituting these values of E back into the expression for theta:\n\ntheta_max = arccos((V_s / (200 sin(314t) \\* (V_s / E))) / R)\ntheta_min = arccos((V_s / (200 sin(314t) \\* (V_s / E))) / R)\n\nSince arccos is a monotonically increasing function, we can conclude that the range of theta is from 0 to 180 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.",
