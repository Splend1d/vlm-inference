(age \u2265 16) AND (age \u2264 18)\nThis expression is true if the person is at least 16 years old and at most 18 years old. This means that the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, as they are 16 or 17 years old.\n\nII. (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18))\nThis expression is true if the person is at least 16 years old and not at least 18 years old. This means that the person is 16 or 17 years old, which is exactly what we want.\n\nIII. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))\nThis expression is true if the person is under 18 years old and not younger than 16 years old. This means that the person is 16 or 17 years old, which is exactly what we want.\n\nTherefore, both expressions II and III are true for the given situation, so the correct answer is D. II and III only.",
