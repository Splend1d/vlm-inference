In this case, the desired confidence level is 0.95, so \u03b1 is 0.05.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find the critical z-value for \u03b1 = 0.05 and a two-tailed test:\n\nz_critical \u2248 1.645\n\nNow, we need to compare the z-score to the critical z-value:\n\nz = 3.44\nz_critical = 1.645\n\nSince 3.44 > 1.645, we can assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days with confidence:\n\nConfidence: 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this value. This is likely due to a rounding error in the question or options. To be as precise as possible, the correct answer would be 0.95 or 95%.",
