This is because the landowner's actions, such as burning the leaves and not considering the wind direction, contributed to the poor visibility on the highway, which ultimately led to the driver crashing his vehicle. The fact that the driver was exceeding the speed limit does not absolve the landowner of liability, as they are strictly liable for the accident.",
