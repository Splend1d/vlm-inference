None of these.\n\nassistant:A. less than 20 years.\n\nExplanation: Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime, and they travel at the speed of light. Since light travels at a speed of 186,282 miles (299,564 kilometers) per second, the waves would take less than 20 years to reach Earth from the star that is 20 light-years away.",
