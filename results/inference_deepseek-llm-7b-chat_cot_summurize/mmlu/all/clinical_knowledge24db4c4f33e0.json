Post-resuscitation care.\n\nA. 3, 1, 2, 4.\nB. 3, 2, 1, 4.\nC. 1, 2, 3, 4.\nD. 2, 1, 3, 4.\n\nassistant:To determine the correct order of the chain of survival, let's analyze each link:\n\n1. Early defibrillation: This is the use of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) to deliver a controlled electric shock to a person's heart to restore a normal rhythm.\n2. Early CPR: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a set of emergency procedures performed on someone whose breathing or heartbeat has stopped.\n3. Recognition and call for help early: This refers to recognizing the signs of a sudden cardiac arrest and calling for help as quickly as possible.\n4. Post-resuscitation care: This involves providing ongoing medical care to a person who has been resuscitated, such as administering medications or monitoring vital signs.\n\nThe correct order of the chain of survival is: recognition and call for help early, early CPR, early defibrillation, and post-resuscitation care. Therefore, the answer is B. 3, 2, 1, 4.",
