The ratio of the working poor to the non-working poor.\n\nassistant:The Lorenz Curve is used to measure the ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries. It is named after Swedish economist Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief. The curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of wealth or income within a country. It shows the cumulative percentage of wealth or income owned by the wealthiest and poorest individuals, and how this changes as the number of individuals in the wealth distribution increases. The Lorenz Curve is often used as a tool for measuring income inequality and can be used to compare the levels of inequality in different countries. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",
