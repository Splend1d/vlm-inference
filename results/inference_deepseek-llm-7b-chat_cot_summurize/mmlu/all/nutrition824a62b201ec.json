The concentration of the substance in food\n\nThis is because the concentration of the substance in the food is an important factor in determining the potential toxicity of the substance. By understanding the concentration of the substance in the food, researchers can better predict how much of the substance a person may consume and how it may affect their health.\n\nThe other options are not as directly relevant to evaluating the safety of a food substance:\n\nA. Rates of consumption of the food to which the substance is added - This is more relevant to understanding the overall consumption of the food and not directly related to the safety of the substance.\n\nC. The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food - This is also relevant to understanding the overall exposure to the substance, but not as directly related to the safety of the substance as the concentration of the substance in the food.\n\nD. The total amount of the substance a person will consume over a lifetime - This is not directly related to the safety of the substance. The safety of a food substance is determined by its potential toxicity and the concentration of the substance in the food, not by the total amount of the substance a person may consume over their lifetime.",
