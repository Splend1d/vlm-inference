Chemosynthetic bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen. These bacteria live in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and other extreme environments where light is scarce. They cannot use photosynthesis, so they have evolved to use chemosynthesis, a process where they convert inorganic compounds into chemical energy. They do this by using the energy released from the oxidation of these compounds, such as ammonia or hydrogen, to produce ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell. This process is different from photosynthesis, which uses light energy to produce ATP, and from organic compound oxidation, which is a process that some chemosynthetic bacteria use as a secondary energy source.",
