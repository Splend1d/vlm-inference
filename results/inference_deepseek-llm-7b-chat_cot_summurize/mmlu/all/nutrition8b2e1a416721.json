To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.\n\nJustification: The primary aim of biochemical functional index measurements is to assess the adequacy of one or more biochemical pathways that respond predictably to changes in status of that specific micronutrient. This allows for a better understanding of the overall adequacy of critical tissues, and the associated risk of potential clinical disease or physiological malfunction.",
