It is desired to bring the sphere to rest by applying a friction force of magnitude 2.0 N to the sphere\u2019s outer surface, a distance of 0.30 m from the sphere\u2019s center. How much time will it take the sphere to come to rest?\n\nA. 4 s\nB. 2 s\nC. 0.06 s\nD. 0.03 s\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the frictional force on an object in motion:\n\nF_friction = \u03bc * F_normal\n\nwhere F_friction is the frictional force, \u03bc is the coefficient of friction, and F_normal is the force acting perpendicular to the surface of the object.\n\nFirst, we need to find the normal force acting on the sphere. The normal force is equal to the gravitational force acting on the sphere, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF_normal = m * g\n\nwhere m is the mass of the sphere and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWe are given that the mass of the sphere is 0.06 kg, and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2. Therefore, the normal force acting on the sphere is:\n\nF_normal = 0.06 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 0.5886 N\n\nNow we can calculate the coefficient of friction, which is equal to the frictional force divided by the normal force:\n\n\u03bc = F_friction / F_normal = 2.0 N / 0.5886 N = 3.40\n\nNow we can use the formula for the frictional force to find the force acting perpendicular to the surface of the sphere:\n\nF_friction = \u03bc * F_normal = 3.40 * 0.5886 N = 1.9448 N\n\nWe are given that the force applied to the sphere is 2.0 N, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the point where the force is applied is 0.30 m. We can use the formula for torque to find the angular acceleration of the sphere:\n\n\u03c4 = I * \u03b1\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the torque, I is the moment of inertia of the sphere, and \u03b1 is the angular acceleration.\n\nThe moment of inertia of a solid sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nI = (2/5) * m * r^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the sphere and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nWe are given that the radius of the sphere is half the distance from the center of the sphere to the point where the force is applied:\n\nr = 0.30 m / 2 = 0.15 m\n\nThe mass of the sphere is given as 0.06 kg. Therefore, the moment of inertia of the sphere is:\n\nI = (2/5) * 0.06 kg * (0.15 m)^2 = 0.0216 kg\u00b7m^2\n\nNow we can find the angular acceleration:\n\n\u03c4 = I * \u03b1 = 2.0 N * \u03b1 = 2.0 N * (2\u03c0 * 20 rad/s) / 0.0216 kg\u00b7m^2 = 685.72 rad/s^2\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for the time it takes for the sphere to come to rest:\n\nt = \u03c9^2 * R\n\nwhere t is the time it takes for the sphere to come to rest, \u03c9 is the angular velocity, and R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nWe are given that the angular velocity of the sphere is 20 rad/s. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is 0.15 m. Therefore, the time it takes for the sphere to come to rest is:\n\nt = (20 rad/s)^2 * 0.15 m = 0.0216 s\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 4 s.",
