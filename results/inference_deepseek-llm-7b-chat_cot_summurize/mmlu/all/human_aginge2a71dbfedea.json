Mechanistic\nB. Organismic\nC. Continuity\nD. Stability\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Organismic.\n\nIf you believe that changes occur slowly and steadily throughout life, you would be holding the Organismic view of development. This perspective emphasizes the continuous growth and development of an individual throughout their life, with changes occurring slowly and steadily over time.\n\nA. Mechanistic is the opposite view, emphasizing that changes occur in a discontinuous and mechanistic way, with major changes happening at certain points in life (e.g. puberty, adolescence, adulthood).\nC. Continuity is not a specific view of development, but rather a general concept that refers to the idea that changes occur gradually and continuously.\nD. Stability is not a view of development, but rather a state of being where an individual's development remains relatively constant over time.",
