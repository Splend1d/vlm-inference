This is because the tax exemption is provided to full-time students, female half-time students, and male half-time students differently, based on their gender and enrollment status. This differentiation does not violate any constitutional provisions, such as the equal protection clause or due process, as long as it is based on a legitimate government purpose. Therefore, option D is the most accurate summary of the correct rule of constitutional law.",
