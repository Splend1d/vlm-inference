What is the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons needed in order to see the pattern? (Assume the lattice spacing of the crystal to be 0.4 nm.)\n\nA. 0.1 eV\nB. 1 eV\nC. 10 eV\nD. 100 eV\n\nassistant:To find the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons needed to see the pattern, we can use Bragg's Law. Bragg's Law states that:\n\nn * sin(theta) = m * lambda / (2 * d)\n\nwhere:\nn is the order of diffraction (integer),\ntheta is the angle of diffraction,\nm is the order of diffraction (integer),\nlambda is the wavelength of the electrons, and\nd is the lattice spacing of the crystal.\n\nWe want to find the kinetic energy (KE) of the electrons, which is related to the wavelength (lambda) by the equation:\n\nKE = hc / lambda\n\nwhere:\nh is the Planck's constant,\nc is the speed of light, and\nlambda is the wavelength of the electrons.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle of diffraction (theta):\n\nn * sin(theta) = m * lambda / (2 * d)\n\nSince we want to see the diffraction pattern, we can assume that n is large (e.g., 100). In this case, we can use the first-order diffraction condition:\n\nn * sin(theta) \u2248 m * lambda / (2 * d)\n\nFor the first-order diffraction condition, m = 1. So, we have:\n\nn * sin(theta) \u2248 1 * lambda / (2 * d)\n\nNow, let's find the wavelength of the electrons (lambda):\n\nKE = hc / lambda\n\nSince we know the kinetic energy (KE) can be approximated as 0.1 eV (100 eV / 10 = 10 eV), we can solve for the wavelength (lambda):\n\n0.1 eV = hc / lambda\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\n0.1 eV = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / lambda\n\nTo find the wavelength (lambda), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nlambda = (0.1 eV) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)\n\nlambda \u2248 4.57 x 10^-10 m\n\nNow, let's find the lattice spacing of the crystal (d):\n\nd = 0.4 nm = 4 x 10^-9 m\n\nFinally, we can find the kinetic energy (KE) of the electrons:\n\nKE = hc / lambda\nKE = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.57 x 10^-10 m)\nKE \u2248 0.1 eV\n\nSo, the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons needed to see the pattern is 0.1 eV (A).",
