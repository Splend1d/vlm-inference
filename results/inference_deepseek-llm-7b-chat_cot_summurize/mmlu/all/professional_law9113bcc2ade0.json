However, the insurance adjuster did not mislead the pedestrian in a way that would have caused the pedestrian to suffer a monetary loss. The insurance adjuster knew that the pedestrian would be entitled to compensation under the state's tort law, and therefore, the adjuster's misrepresentation did not cause the pedestrian any actual monetary loss. Therefore, the answer is C. No, because the insurance adjuster's statements did not cause the pedestrian any monetary loss.",
