Twenty-five different engine types are selected at random and each one is tested using oil with the additive and oil without the additive. What type of analysis will yield the most useful information?\n\nA. Matched pairs comparison of population proportions\nB. Matched pairs comparison of population means\nC. Independent samples comparison of population proportions\nD. Independent samples comparison of population means\n\nassistant:B. Matched pairs comparison of population means\n\nA matched pairs comparison of population means would be the most useful analysis for this study. In this type of analysis, each engine type would be tested with both the additive and the control (no additive) oil. The means of the lifespan of the engines for each engine type would be compared, allowing the manufacturer to see if there is a significant difference in the lifespan between the two oil types. This would give the manufacturer information on whether the additive is effective in increasing the lifespan of the engines.",
