Interdivisional misogynist speech\nB. Intradivisional misogynist speech\nC. Interpersonal misogynist speech\nD. A and B only\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will look up the definition of Richardson-Self's forms of misogynist speech and determine which options match.\n\nRichardson-Self identifies three forms of misogynist speech: interdivisional, intradivisional, and interpersonal. These forms refer to the context in which misogyny occurs.\n\nA. Interdivisional misogynist speech: This occurs when there is a difference in the level of power or status between the speaker and the target of the misogynistic speech.\n\nB. Intradivisional misogynist speech: This occurs when there is no difference in the level of power or status between the speaker and the target of the misogynistic speech.\n\nC. Interpersonal misogynist speech: This occurs when there is a difference in the level of power or status between the speaker and the target of the misogynistic speech, but it is a specific instance between two individuals.\n\nNow, I will look at the options provided:\n\nA. Interdivisional misogynist speech - This option is not a form of Richardson-Self's misogyny, but rather a definition of a different type of misogyny.\n\nD. A and B only - This option is not a form of Richardson-Self's misogyny, but rather a statement about the two forms of misogyny mentioned.\n\nC. Interpersonal misogynist speech - This option is one of Richardson-Self's forms of misogyny, as it involves a difference in the level of power or status between the speaker and the target.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Interpersonal misogynist speech.",
