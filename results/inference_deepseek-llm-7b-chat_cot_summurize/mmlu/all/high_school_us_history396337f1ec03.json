Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians created a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers.\n\nassistant:The song and movement that \"The Hayseed\" was connected to highlight the development of corruption in government, especially as it related to big business, energizing the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments. This is option A.\n\nThe lyrics mention the railroads and old party bosses banding together to oppress the hayseed, which could be interpreted as a reference to the corruption and power struggles between various interest groups, including big business, during the late 1800s. The song also mentions monopolies banding together to oppress the hayseed, which could be seen as a reference to the growing power of big business and their ability to influence government policies and legislation.\n\nOption B, the movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers, exerting a great deal of leverage over federal legislation, is not supported by the lyrics. The song does not mention any specific struggles or movements by farmers or urban workers.\n\nOption C, the breakdown of the two-party system and the emergence of an additional major party that won control of Congress within ten years of its founding, is also not supported by the lyrics. The song does not mention any changes to the political system or the emergence of new political parties.\n\nOption D, the continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians creating a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers, is not directly supported by the lyrics. While the song does not mention the frontier or American Indians, it does not provide enough information to conclude that this was a significant factor in the broader society during the late 1800s.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option A: Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.",
