Casparian strip\nC. pericycle\nD. endoderm\n\nassistant:The first point of entry of water at the roots of a monocot plant is through the cytoplasm of cells of the root cap. This is because the root cap is the outermost layer of cells in the root, and it provides a protective barrier against excessive water loss and helps to regulate the movement of water and ions into the root. The other options are not related to the entry of water at the roots of a monocot plant. The Casparian strip is a cell wall feature in plant roots, the pericycle is a layer of cells in the root meristem, and the endoderm is a layer of cells in the root epidermis.",
