This is an example of which of the following?\n\nA. Frictional unemployment\nB. Structural unemployment\nC. Cyclical unemployment\nD. Seasonal unemployment\n\nassistant:The user provided an example of structural unemployment. Structural unemployment occurs when the skills or technologies that workers have do not match the needs of the economy. In this case, the dark room technician has the skills to develop film, but the demand for film cameras and film has decreased, leading to his unemployment. This is not frictional unemployment (transient joblessness due to temporary gaps in the labor market), cyclical unemployment (caused by business cycle fluctuations), or seasonal unemployment (related to fluctuations in the demand for labor in specific industries due to changes in the seasons).",
