Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is simply skating at a skating rink, which is generally considered a normal, innocent activity. In Scenario 2, the main character attacks a home invader, which is morally justified because the home invader is clearly committing a wrong act. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the home invader's actions are clearly morally wrong, making the main character's actions (in defending themselves and their home) not wrong.",
