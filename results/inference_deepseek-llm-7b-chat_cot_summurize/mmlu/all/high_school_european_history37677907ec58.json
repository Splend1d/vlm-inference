Utopian socialism\nB. Social conservatism\nC. Romanticism\nD. Social Darwinism\n\nassistant:The passage is a quote from Herbert Spencer, who was a prominent philosopher and sociologist in the 19th century. The quote discusses the role of the government in alleviating poverty and distress, and argues that the state should focus on protecting individual freedoms rather than providing direct relief to citizens. This suggests that Spencer believed in a philosophy that emphasizes the role of individuals and natural selection in shaping society, rather than relying on government intervention to solve social problems.\n\nGiven this context, the most likely answer to the question \"From the passage, one may infer that Spencer advocated which social philosophy?\" is:\n\nD.
