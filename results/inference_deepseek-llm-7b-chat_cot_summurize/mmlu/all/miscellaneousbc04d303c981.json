Overproduce the good relative to the socially optimal level of output.\n\nWhen the production of a good generates negative externalities, it means that the production of that good has negative impacts on third parties that are not directly involved in the production process. These negative impacts can be environmental pollution, health risks, or social costs, among others.\n\nIn a market economy, producers are incentivized to produce goods and services that have a positive return on investment. If the production of a good generates negative externalities, the private market will overproduce the good relative to the socially optimal level of output. This is because the negative externalities associated with the production of the good make it more expensive for producers to produce and sell the good, and thus they will produce more of it to compensate for the additional costs.\n\nThis overproduction can lead to an excess supply of the good, which can cause a drop in the price of the good, leading to a surplus. This surplus can lead to waste, which is inefficient and costly for society. Therefore, it is important to regulate the production of goods that generate negative externalities to ensure that the production of the good does not exceed the socially optimal level of output.\n\nOption B is incorrect because underproduction of the good relative to the socially optimal level of output is not a likely outcome when negative externalities are present. Option C is incorrect because the private market does not have the information or incentive to compensate third parties harmed by the negative externality. Option D is incorrect because charging lower than the market equilibrium price to compensate for the externality is not a likely outcome because it would not be profitable for producers.",
