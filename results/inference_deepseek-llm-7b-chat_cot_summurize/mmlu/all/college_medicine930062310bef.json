This trigger is eventually suppressed by which mechanism?\n\nA. Constriction of blood flow to the adrenal gland.\nB. Exhaustion of the body\u2019s store of CRF.\nC. Negative feedback loop of cortisol.\nD. Release of CRF-inhibitory factor.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Negative feedback loop of cortisol.\n\nThe hypothalamus releases CRF, which leads to the release of cortisol as the body's stress hormone. This trigger is eventually suppressed by a negative feedback loop of cortisol, which means that once cortisol is released, it signals the hypothalamus to stop releasing CRF and suppress the stress response.\n\nOption A is incorrect because constriction of blood flow to the adrenal gland is not a mechanism by which the stress response is suppressed. Option B is incorrect because exhaustion of the body's store of CRF is not a mechanism by which the stress response is suppressed. Option D is incorrect because the release of CRF-inhibitory factor is not a mechanism by which the stress response is suppressed.",
