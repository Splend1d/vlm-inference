The widowin no way relied on the hotel's promise to pay the $5,000.\nD. There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n\nassistant:The strongest argument against enforcement of the certificate agreement in this scenario would be option B: There was no privity of contract between the widow and the hotel. Privity of contract refers to the existence of a direct contractual relationship between two parties. In this case, the employee signed the certificate, making him the only party who had a direct contractual relationship with the hotel. The widow did not sign the certificate, therefore she did not have a direct contractual relationship with the hotel. As a result, the widow's claim for the $5,000 payment would be invalid, since she is not a party to the contract. The other options do not provide a strong enough argument against enforcement of the certificate agreement. The widow's unawareness of the certificate agreement (option A) and her lack of reliance on the hotel's promise (option C) do not necessarily prevent enforcement of the agreement. Similarly, the lack of consideration to support the certificate agreement (option D) might be a technicality, but it does not necessarily disprove the enforceability of the agreement.",
