Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character simply recommends a restaurant to their in-laws after getting sick there. This action is not morally wrong, as they are just sharing their experience and opinion with others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character fires a gun at a bull's eye at a shooting range. This action may be seen as morally wrong by some people, as it involves the use of a potentially dangerous and powerful weapon, but it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
