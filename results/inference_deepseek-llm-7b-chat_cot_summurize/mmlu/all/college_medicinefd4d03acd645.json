The female is on the opposite side of the street. Crossing the street, the pedestrian notices that the young woman appears both much wealthier than he is and is of a different ethnicity. Seeing no one else present, the pedestrian renders aid. According to the bystander effect, which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts?\n\nA. The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one\nB. The presence of another group of people one block up the street\nC. The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one\nD. The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl\n\nassistant:According to the bystander effect, the presence of other people increases the likelihood that individuals will not offer assistance to someone in need (Bandura, 1969). Therefore, the presence of other people, regardless of their characteristics, would likely decrease the pedestrian's likelihood of helping the young woman. \n\nOption A: The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one - This would likely increase the pedestrian's likelihood of helping, as it may reduce the bystander effect.\n\nOption B: The presence of another group of people one block up the street - This would likely increase the bystander effect and decrease the pedestrian's likelihood of helping.\n\nOption C: The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one - This would likely have no effect on the bystander effect.\n\nOption D: The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl - This would likely decrease the bystander effect and increase the likelihood of the pedestrian helping.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one would change how the pedestrian reacts, increasing the likelihood of helping.",
