Which of the following describes the activity after the potato is immersed into the water?\n\nA. Water moves from the potato into the surrounding water.\nB. Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.\nC. Potato cells plasmolyze.\nD. Solutes in the water move into the potato.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Solutes in the water move into the potato. When a piece of potato is dropped into a beaker of pure water, the potato will absorb water from the surrounding water through its cells. This process, known as osmosis, is the movement of water molecules from an area of higher concentration (the surrounding water) to an area of lower concentration (the potato). The solutes (such as sugar, salt, or other substances) in the water also move into the potato, but their movement is primarily driven by the water's movement.",
