Legislation, Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nB. Internal company policy, Unethical corporate practices act\nC. Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nD. Legislation, Unethical corporate practices act\n\nassistant:The answer is C. Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nIn the United States, legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is a key factor in driving ethical business practices. This law was enacted in the wake of a series of corporate scandals, including the Enron and WorldCom debacles, and was designed to improve the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting by publicly traded companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes strict penalties on individuals and corporations that engage in fraudulent accounting practices and requires companies to establish internal controls and procedures to prevent such misconduct. It also establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to oversee the audits of public companies and holds the CEOs and CFOs of these companies personally liable for the accuracy and completeness of their company's financial statements.\n\nInternal company policies, on the other hand, are rules and procedures that companies establish to guide their behavior and ensure ethical practices. These policies may cover a wide range of areas, such as conflicts of interest, whistleblower protection, and data privacy. By establishing these policies, companies can create a culture of ethical behavior and hold employees accountable for their actions.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act.",
