The complementary event is that the chip chosen is not defective.\n\nProbability of choosing a non-defective chip from Company X = (4 - 1) / 5 = 3 / 5\nProbability of choosing a non-defective chip from Company Y = (4 - 2) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1 / 2\n\nProbability of choosing a non-defective chip from either Company X or Y = (3 / 5) * (1 / 2) = 3 / 10\n\nProbability of choosing a non-defective chip from Company Y (because the chip is defective) = 1 - (3 / 10) = 7 / 10\n\nProbability that the chip came from Company Y given that it is defective = (7 / 10) / (3 / 10) = 7 / 3 = 1 / 1.33 \u2248 0.769\n\nAnswer: C. 1 / 2",
