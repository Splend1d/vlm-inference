This is because the body needs to produce more energy to meet the increased demands of physical activity, and lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic respiration, which is how the body produces energy during high-intensity exercise. As the players become more fatigued, their muscles are less efficient at removing lactate from the bloodstream, which leads to an increase in blood lactate concentration.",
