The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size.\nD. The Moon was once entirely molten.\n\nassistant:The Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that the Moon was formed as a result of a massive impact between the young Earth and a Mars-sized body (called Theia) during the early days of the Solar System. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes:\n\nA. The relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth is large compared to most planets and their moon. This is because, according to the Giant Impact Hypothesis, the Theia body that collided with the Earth during the impact was similar in size to Mars, resulting in the Moon being significantly larger than most other natural satellites in our Solar System.\n\nB. Most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface. This is because the Moon's surface has not been subjected to as much geological activity as Earth's surface, and as a result, the rocks on the Moon are thought to be older on average.\n\nC. The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size. This is because the impact that formed the Moon would have been highly explosive, and the heat generated from the impact would have melted the rocks and metals, causing them to be distributed more uniformly throughout the Moon's interior.\n\nD. The Moon was once entirely molten. This is a result of the impact that formed the Moon, and is consistent with the Giant Impact Hypothesis. The impact would have been so powerful that it would have melted much of the Earth-Moon system, creating a molten mixture of Earth and Theia material that eventually solidified to form the Moon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: The Moon was once entirely molten.",
