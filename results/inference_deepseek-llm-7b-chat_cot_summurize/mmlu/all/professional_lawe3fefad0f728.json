The argument states that the worker's objection to the negligence instruction was preserved when he submitted his proposed negligence instruction. This is because the worker did not object to the negligence instruction before it was given, but by submitting the proposed instruction, he preserved the issue for appeal. Therefore, the court may find that the worker's objection was not waived and grant the motion for a new trial.",
