What is the number?\n\nA. 38\nB. 42\nC. 638\nD. 642\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the following equation:\n\nnumber = 4 * quotient + remainder\n\nwhere number is the unknown number, quotient is the integer division result, and remainder is the remainder of the division.\n\nWe are given that the remainder is 2 and that the quotient when the number is divided by 4 is 160. So, we can write the equation as:\n\nnumber = 4 * 160 + 2\n\nNow, we can solve for the number:\n\nnumber = 640 + 2\nnumber = 642\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 642.",
