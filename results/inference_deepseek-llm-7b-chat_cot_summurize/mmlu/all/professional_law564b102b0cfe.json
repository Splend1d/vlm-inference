The niece was not a party to the original conveyance, but she was entitled to the benefits of the mortgage as a third-party beneficiary. Therefore, the mortgagee (the niece) will probably succeed in recovering the amount of the mortgage due from the farmer.\n\nA. The implied delegation of duties from the woman's conveyance to the farmer does not necessarily mean that the niece will succeed in recovering the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee's success depends on whether the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n\nC. The farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, but the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer. Therefore, the mortgagee (the niece) will probably succeed in recovering the amount of the mortgage due from the farmer.\n\nD. The fact that the farmer did not have constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage does not necessarily mean that the mortgagee (the niece) will not succeed in recovering the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee's success depends on whether the farmer had actual notice of the mortgage.",
