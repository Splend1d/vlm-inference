During a period of inflation would Mast's ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO be higher or lower than FIFO? Ending inventory Income tax payable\n\nA. Lower Lower\nB. Higher Higher\nC. Lower Higher\nD. Higher Lower\n\nassistant:Using the LIFO method, the cost of ending inventory will be higher than the FIFO method because the older, higher cost items are sold first. Similarly, income tax payable will be lower because LIFO allows for the use of lower cost inventory that has been previously taxed, reducing the tax liability. Therefore, the answer is D. Higher, Lower.",
