John wants to calculate the hourly rate, If he works a total of 3.5 hours, the equation 3.5x = 49 can be used to determine his hourly rate. What would John\u2019s hourly rate be, in dollars?\n\nA. $1.40 \nB. $14.00 \nC. $45.50 \nD. $171.50\n\nassistant:To solve the equation, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:\n3.5x \ufffd 3.5 = 49 \ufffd 3.5\n\n2. Simplify the equation:\nx = 49 \ufffd 3.5\n\n3. Calculate the value of x:\nx \u2248 14.00\n\n4. Multiply the value of x by the total hours worked to find the hourly rate:\n14.00 x 3.5 = 49\n\n5. The answer is B. John's hourly rate would be $14.00.",
