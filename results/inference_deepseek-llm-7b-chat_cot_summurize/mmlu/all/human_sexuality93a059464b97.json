The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for the \"rest and digest\" response, which helps the body relax and prepare for sexual activity. It does this by increasing blood flow to the genital area, leading to an erection. The sympathetic nervous system, on the other hand, is responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response and does not play a role in sexual arousal.",
