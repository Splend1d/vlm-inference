Suppose that only applicants with scores above 700 are considered. What percentage of the applicants considered have scores below 740? (Assume the scores are normally distributed.)\n\nA. 13.3%\nB. 17.1%\nC. 82.9%\nD. 86.7%\n\nassistant:This problem can be solved using the z-score. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation or data point is from the mean. In this case, we want to find the percentage of applicants with scores below 740, where the mean LSAT score is 650 and the standard deviation is 45.\n\nFirst, we calculate the z-score for a score of 740:\n\nz = (740 - 650) / 45\nz = 90 / 45\nz = 2\n\nNow, we look up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding percentage. A z-score of 2 corresponds to a probability of 0.9772, which is approximately 97.72%.\n\nSince we want to find the percentage of applicants with scores below 740, we subtract this probability from 100%:\n\n100% - 97.72% = 2.28%\n\nTherefore, approximately 2.28% of the applicants considered have scores below 740.
