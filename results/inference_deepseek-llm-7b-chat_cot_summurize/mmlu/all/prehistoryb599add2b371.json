The Pleistocene epoch, also known as the Ice Age, lasted from around 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago, and was characterized by significant fluctuations in global temperatures, with periods of extremely cold conditions interspersed with warmer periods. During this time, large mammals such as mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and woolly rhinoceroses flourished in the colder climate.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Miocene epoch, which occurred from around 23 to 5 million years ago, was a warmer period in Earth's history.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Pliocene epoch, which occurred from around 5 to 2.58 million years ago, was a slightly cooler period than the Miocene epoch but still generally warmer than the Pleistocene epoch.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Pleistocene epoch, which we are discussing, occurred after the Miocene epoch and was a much colder period than the Miocene epoch.",
