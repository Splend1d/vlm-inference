Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell. is the statement that is not correct.\n\nIn plant embryogenesis, cotyledons are actually derived from the endosperm tissue, which is formed from the maternal (female) gamete that fertilizes the egg cell. The endosperm provides nutrients to the developing embryo during early stages of development.",
