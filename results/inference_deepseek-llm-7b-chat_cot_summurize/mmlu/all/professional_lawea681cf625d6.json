On the date the sale was to take place, the buyer tendered a $10,000 cashier's check to the seller. The seller rejected the tender and refused to deliver the car to the buyer.

Recovery of the market price of the car.\n\nassistant:The buyer is entitled to the recovery of the contract price of the car. This is because the seller rejected the tender and refused to deliver the car, which is a breach of the contract. The buyer can sue for damages, but the specific performance is not available in this case as the seller did not perform their part of the contract. The market price of the car is not relevant in this situation as it does not take into account the breach of contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Recovery of the contract price of the car.",
