Option I if it needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan\nC. Option III if it needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan\nD. All of the above answers are correct.\n\nassistant:To determine which option the company should choose, we need to calculate the expected return for each option.\n\nOption I:\nExpected return = Sure return = $25,000\n\nOption II:\nExpected return = (0.5 * $50,000) + (0.5 * $10,000) = $25,000\n\nOption III:\nExpected return = (0.05 * $100,000) + (0.95 * $0) = $5,000\n\nComparing the expected returns:\nOption I: $25,000\nOption II: $25,000\nOption III: $5,000\n\nSince the expected returns for Options I and II are the same, the company can choose either of them. However, if the company needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan, Option I is the best choice. If the company needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan, Option II is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above answers are correct.",
