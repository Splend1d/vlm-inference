(Assume that the order of the cards does not matter.)\n\nA. 8788\nB. 2\nC. 2197\nD. 21\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. 8788.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nSince the order of the cards does not matter and all three cards must be of different suits, we can use the combination formula to solve this problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards without considering the suits is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of cards (52) and k is the number of cards to choose (3).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 cards without considering the suits is:\n\nC(52, 3) = 52! / (3! * (52 - 3)!)\n\nC(52, 3) = 52! / (3! * 52!)\n\nNow, we need to consider the different suits. We have 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) and we want to choose 3 cards of different suits.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits from a standard deck of 52 cards can be found by considering each suit separately and then summing up the results.\n\nFor the hearts suit, we have 13 cards to choose from. The number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits from the hearts suit is:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13 - 3)!)\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * 10!)\n\nFor the diamonds suit, we have 13 cards to choose from. The number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits from the diamonds suit is:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13 - 3)!)\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * 10!)\n\nFor the clubs suit, we have 13 cards to choose from. The number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits from the clubs suit is:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13 - 3)!)\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * 10!)\n\nFor the spades suit, we have 13 cards to choose from. The number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits from the spades suit is:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13 - 3)!)\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * 10!)\n\nNow, we need to sum up the results:\n\n52! / (3! * 52!) + 13! / (3! * 10!) + 13! / (3! * 10!) + 13! / (3! * 10!) = 52! / (3! * 52!) + 13! / (3! * 10!) + 13! / (3! * 10!) + 13! / (3! * 10!)\n\n= (52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46 * 45 * 44 * 43 * 42 * 41 * 40 * 39 * 38 * 37 * 36 * 35 * 34 * 33 * 32 * 31 * 30 * 29 * 28 * 27 * 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21 * 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13) / (3 * 2 * 1 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 10)\n\n= 8788\n\nSo, there are 8788 ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, if all three cards must be of different suits.",
