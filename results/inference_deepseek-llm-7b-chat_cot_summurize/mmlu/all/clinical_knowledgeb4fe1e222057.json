Reduced amount of gastric acid.\n\nHypochlorhydria is a condition characterized by a reduced amount of gastric acid in the stomach. Gastric acid is necessary for the proper digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients. In hypochlorhydria, this process may be impaired, leading to a variety of symptoms such as bloating, heartburn, and indigestion. Treatment for hypochlorhydria typically involves increasing the amount of gastric acid in the stomach, either through dietary changes or medication.",
