This is because the photograph itself does not contain any written or spoken words that provide information about the marriage. It only shows a scene of a wedding, but it does not provide any direct evidence of the marriage itself. Therefore, it cannot be used as evidence in court.\n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\nA. admissible, only if the photographer is available to testify concerning the circumstances under which the photograph was taken: This option is not correct because the photograph itself is not considered as evidence, but rather as non-verbal hearsay. Therefore, the photographer's testimony would not be admissible, even if the photographer was available to testify.\n\nB. admissible, only if a witness verifies that it is a correct and accurate representation of the relevant facts: This option is not correct because the photograph is not considered as evidence, but rather as non-verbal hearsay. Therefore, a witness's verification would not be admissible, even if the photograph was considered to be accurate and correct.\n\nD. inadmissible as not the best evidence: This option is not correct because the photograph is not considered as evidence, but rather as non-verbal hearsay. Therefore, it would not be considered as the best evidence, even if it was admissible.",
