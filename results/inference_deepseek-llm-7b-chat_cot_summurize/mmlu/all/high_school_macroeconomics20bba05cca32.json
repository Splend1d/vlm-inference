This policy helps to increase demand in the economy, which in turn encourages businesses to hire more workers and invest in new projects. By increasing taxes, the government can also reduce the deficit and stabilize the economy.\n\nOption B is incorrect because reducing government spending and taxes during a recession can lead to a further contraction of the economy. Option C is also incorrect because increasing government spending and reducing taxes may not have a significant impact on stimulating economic growth. Option D is incorrect because increasing government spending and taxes can help to stabilize the economy, but decreasing government spending and increasing taxes may not be effective in addressing a recession.",
