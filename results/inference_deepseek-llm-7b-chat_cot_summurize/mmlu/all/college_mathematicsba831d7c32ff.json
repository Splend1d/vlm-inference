What is the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other?\n\nA. 0.64\nB. 0.72\nC. 0.81\nD. 0.95\n\nassistant:To find the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other, we can use the principle of complementary probability. The probability that one integer chosen is not a square of the other is the probability that the other integer is not a square of the first integer.\n\nThere are 10 integers from 1 to 10, and only 2 of them are squares (1 and 4). So, the probability that one integer chosen is a square of the other is 2/10 = 1/5.\n\nSince the probability that one integer chosen is a square of the other is 1/5, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is 4/5, which is closest to option B.",
