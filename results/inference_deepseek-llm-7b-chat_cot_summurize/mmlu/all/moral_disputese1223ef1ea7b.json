Persons can never have a right to aid from anyone.\nB. The right to aid is a negative right.\nC. The consequences of helping the poor would be worse than the consequences of not helping them.\nD. This kind of right would require a contract or agreement, and the affluent haven't entered into a contract or agreement with the poor.\n\nassistant:Arthur believes that the poor do not have a right to aid from the affluent because he thinks that the right to aid is a negative right. According to him, the right to aid is a concept that limits the affluent from doing what they want with their wealth, as it implies that they have an obligation to provide aid to the poor. This is different from positive rights, which grant individuals the freedom to do what they want, as long as they do not harm others or infringe upon their rights. Arthur believes that the concept of a right to aid is a negative right because it puts limits on the affluent's freedom and autonomy.\n\nMoreover, Arthur may also argue that the consequences of helping the poor could be worse than the consequences of not helping them. He might believe that the affluent's financial resources could be better allocated in other areas, such as investing in education, research, or other social programs that could benefit everyone. He might also think that providing aid to the poor could create a dependency on government or affluent individuals, which could result in long-term negative effects.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Arthur's perspective is not universally accepted, and there are many who believe that the poor do have a right to aid from the affluent. These individuals argue that the affluent have a moral obligation to help those in need, as they have been fortunate enough to accumulate wealth and resources. They may also believe that helping the poor can have positive social and economic effects, such as reducing poverty and inequality, and improving overall societal well-being.",
