The students must demonstrate that the law is not substantially related to an important state interest.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The state must demonstrate that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The state law provides funding for public schools based on per-student basis from general state revenues, and all other public monies used to support public schools come from locally levied real estate taxes. This results in a large disparity in per-student funding among the state's many public school districts. The students who claim to be disadvantaged by this school funding law have challenged the law solely on the ground that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Therefore, the state must show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.",
