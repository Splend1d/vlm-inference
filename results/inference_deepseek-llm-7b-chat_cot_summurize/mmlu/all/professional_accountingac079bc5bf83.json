Bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, is for a period of\n\nA. Three months.\nB. Four months.\nC. Six months.\nD. Seven months.\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. The bond was issued on June 1, year 1.\n2. Interest payment dates are April 1 and October 1.\n3. The bond interest expense is for a period of the year ended December 31, year 1.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of months for the interest payment period:\n\nApril 1 - June 1 = 2 months\nOctober 1 - December 1 = 3 months\n\nThe total interest payment period for the year is 2 months (April-June) + 3 months (October-December) = 5 months.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of months in the entire year:\n\nThere are 12 months in a year.\n\nFinally, let's find the proportion of the interest payment period in relation to the entire year:\n\n5 months / 12 months = 0.4167\n\nNone of the provided options (A, B, C, or D) exactly match the proportion of 0.4167. However, option B (Four months) is the closest to the proportion of the interest payment period in relation to the entire year. Therefore, the answer is B.",
