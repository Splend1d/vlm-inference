The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\nC. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will increase.\nD. The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nassistant:To determine the most true statement, let's analyze the given information and calculate the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) for each worker.\n\nLet's assume the firm hires 3 workers: Worker 1, Worker 2, and Worker 3. Let x be the number of additional workers hired.\n\nFor the first worker, the contribution to the total revenue (TR) is the product of the wage (W) and the number of workers hired (x), which is Wx. The marginal revenue (MR) for the first worker is the difference between the total revenue and the revenue generated by the remaining workers, which is TR - Wx. The marginal revenue product of the first worker (MRPL) is the derivative of the marginal revenue with respect to the number of workers hired, which is d(TR)/dx - W.\n\nFor the second worker, the contribution to the total revenue is W(x + 1), and the marginal revenue is TR - W(x + 1) - Wx. The MRPL for the second worker is d(TR)/dx - 2W.\n\nFor the third worker, the contribution to the total revenue is W(x + 2), and the marginal revenue is TR - W(x + 2) - Wx - W(x + 1). The MRPL for the third worker is d(TR)/dx - 3W.\n\nNow, we need to find the marginal revenue product of the 3rd worker (MRPL of the 3rd worker). Since the MP of the 3rd worker is 10, we can set the MRPL of the 3rd worker equal to 10:\n\nd(TR)/dx - 3W = 10\n\nTo find the most true statement, let's analyze the different scenarios:\n\nA. If the firm hires more labor, the total revenue will increase, and the MRPL for the additional workers will also increase. This will increase the MRPL for the 3rd worker, as it is the least productive worker. Therefore, the most true statement would be B: The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nB. If the firm hires more labor, the total revenue will increase, and the MRPL for the additional workers will also increase. This will increase the MRPL for the 3rd worker, as it is the least productive worker. Therefore, the most true statement would be D: The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nC. If the firm hires less labor, the total revenue will decrease, and the MRPL for the remaining workers will also decrease. This will decrease the MRPL for the 3rd worker, as it is the least productive worker. Therefore, the most true statement would be D: The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, the most true statement would be either D: The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease or D: The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease.",
