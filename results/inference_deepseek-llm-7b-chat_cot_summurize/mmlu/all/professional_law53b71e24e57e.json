This is because the landlord had the right to consent or refuse to consent to the assignment of the leasehold interest, and since the landlord did not consent to the assignment, it can be considered void. The covenant prohibiting assignments did run with the land, as it was a part of the original leasehold agreement. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",
