Scenario 1 | I consider friendly fire to be a serious hobby. Scenario 2 | I gave the students an F for the semester for answering the questions correctly.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:B. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character considers friendly fire to be a serious hobby. Friendly fire refers to the act of unintentionally attacking one's own allies while engaged in combat. This is morally wrong because it puts innocent people at risk and goes against the principles of cooperation and protection that underpin military operations.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character gives the students an F for the semester for answering the questions correctly. This is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While it might be seen as unfair or ungenerous, it does not violate any fundamental principles of morality. The decision to give an F for correctly answering questions might be subject to debate, but it does not necessarily imply a clear moral wrongdoing.",
