The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\n\nThis answer is correct because it suggests that the game's running speed can be improved by finding approximate solutions instead of the best possible one. This would allow the computer to make decisions faster, resulting in a quicker game.\n\nIncorrect answers:\nA: This answer is incorrect because it suggests that the game can only be played between two human players, which is not the case.\nC: This answer is incorrect because it suggests that computers cannot be improved, which is not true.\nD: This answer is incorrect because it does not provide a solution to improve the game's running speed.",
