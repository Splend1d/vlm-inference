The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages.\nB. The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages.\nC. The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children.\nD. The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\n\nassistant:B. The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages.\n\nThis statement is the correct answer. The human body has a constant need for amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. The amino acid requirements for adults are assumed to be the requirements for maintenance, which means that these requirements are the minimum amount of amino acids needed to support the body's normal functions and prevent deficiency. This assumption holds true for all ages, not just for adults.\n\nA. is incorrect because the amino acid requirements for adults are not assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages.\n\nC. is incorrect because the amino acid pattern of breast milk is not assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children. The requirements for children vary depending on their age, growth, and development.\n\nD. is incorrect because the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is not assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children. The requirements for infants and young children are determined by their age, growth, and development.",
