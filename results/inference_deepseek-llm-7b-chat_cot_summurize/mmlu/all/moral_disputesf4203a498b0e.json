It was developed to provide a framework for determining when it is morally permissible to engage in warfare. According to this theory, wars are not always morally wrong, but certain conditions must be met before a war can be considered just. These conditions include the need for a just cause, the right intention, the ability to secure a reasonable chance of success, the avoidance of unnecessary loss of life, and a clear distinction between combatants and civilians.\n\nB. antiwar pacifism is not the correct answer because it refers to a broader view that opposes all forms of war, rather than specifically evaluating the morality of warfare.\n\nC. moral nihilism is not the correct answer because it is a philosophical view that holds that there are no moral truths or values, whereas just war theory evaluates the morality of warfare.\n\nD. jus ad bellum is not the correct answer because it refers to the first stage of just war theory, which deals with the conditions that must be met before a war can be considered just.",
