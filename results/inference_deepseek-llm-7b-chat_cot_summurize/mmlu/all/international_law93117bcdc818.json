In other words, it is the ability of a court to take action on a particular legal claim or right. In this context, the term \"justiciability\" is used to determine whether a legal claim or right can be enforced by a court or tribunal. This is an important consideration in legal proceedings because some legal claims or rights may not be justiciable, meaning that they cannot be enforced by a court.",
