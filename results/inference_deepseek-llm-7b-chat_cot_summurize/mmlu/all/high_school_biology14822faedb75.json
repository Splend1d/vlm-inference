MRSA, which has become resistant to many antibiotics\nD. Multiple sclerosis, which attacks the cells of the nervous system\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The flu virus, which changes its envelope proteins.\n\nThis is an example of antigenic variation because the flu virus needs to change its surface antigens to avoid recognition by the host's immune system. This variation allows the virus to rapidly evolve and adapt to different environments, making it more difficult for the host's immune system to recognize and eliminate it.\n\nA. HIV, which can remain integrated into the host genome for many years, is an example of latency rather than antigenic variation.\nC. MRSA, which has become resistant to many antibiotics, is an example of antibiotic resistance rather than antigenic variation.\nD. Multiple sclerosis, which attacks the cells of the nervous system, is a disease rather than a mechanism of antigenic variation.",
