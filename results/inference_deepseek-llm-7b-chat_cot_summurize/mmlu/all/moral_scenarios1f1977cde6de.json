Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character (who uses \"I/me/my\") washes their son's bed sheets with bleach. While this might not be the most environmentally friendly option, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tests out their laser pointer by aiming it at a helicopter. This is morally wrong because it is illegal to aim a laser pointer at an aircraft, which can cause serious eye damage to the pilots and potentially endanger the flight.",
