John Quincy Adams was chosen as the president, and Jackson became the vice president. Adams was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, which was a predecessor of the modern Democratic Party, while Jackson was not a member of any established political party. Therefore, the presidency was won by someone who was not a member of the Federalist Party.",
