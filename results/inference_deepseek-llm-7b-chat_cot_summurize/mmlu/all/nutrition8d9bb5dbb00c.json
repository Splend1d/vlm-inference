As simple Fe2+ in the serum\nB. Bound to albumin\nC. Bound to ferritin\nD. Bound to transferrin\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Bound to transferrin.\n\nHere's how I arrived at the answer:\n\n* The user asked about the transport of iron in the body's circulation.\n* Iron is transported in the blood as a compound, either as Fe2+ (iron) or as a protein-bound form.\n* Iron is transported in the blood as a protein-bound form, primarily through transferrin and ferritin.\n* Therefore, the correct answer is D. Bound to transferrin, as this is the protein-bound form of iron that is transported in the blood.",
