We want to find the points P and Q such that f has a local maximum at P, a saddle point at Q, and a local minimum at Q.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the function by taking the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n\u2202f/\u2202x = 3x^2 + 3y\n\u2202f/\u2202y = 3y^2 + 3x\n\nNow, set the partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y:\n\n3x^2 + 3y = 0\n3y^2 + 3x = 0\n\nDivide both equations by 3:\n\nx^2 + y = 0\ny^2 + x = 0\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n\nx^2 + 2y^2 + x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(x + 2y^2) = 0\n\nSince x = 0 is not a critical point (it's a minimum), we have x + 2y^2 = 0. This implies that x = -2y^2. Substitute x = -2y^2 into the original function:\n\nf(x, y) = (-2y^2)^3 + y^3 + 3(-2y^2)y\nf(x, y) = -8y^6 + y^3 + 6y^3\nf(x, y) = -8y^6 + 7y^3\n\nNow, we can find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n\u2202f/\u2202x = 0\n\u2202f/\u2202y = 0\n\nSince x = -2y^2, we have:\n\n\u2202f/\u2202x = 0\n\u2202f/\u2202y = 0\n\nHowever, there are no real solutions for x and y that satisfy these conditions. This means that there are no local maximums or saddle points for the function f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. There exist distinct points P and Q such that f has a local maximum at P and a local maximum at Q.",
