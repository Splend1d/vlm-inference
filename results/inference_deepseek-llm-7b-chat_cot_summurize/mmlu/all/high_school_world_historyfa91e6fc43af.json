That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects\n\nassistant:The first passage, which refers to William Bentinck's statement about the suppression of sati, undermines the commonly held assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. This passage shows that Bentinck recognized the horror of allowing innocent victims to suffer and ultimately decided to support an open and general prohibition of sati. This suggests that Bentinck was concerned with the welfare of the Indians and was willing to make a change based on humanitarian reasons, rather than imposing a Western cultural norm.\n\nThe second passage, by George Simpson, does not directly address the commonly held assumptions about Western imperialism. However, it does highlight the fact that European colonizers, such as Simpson, believed that they needed to \"rule with a rod of iron\" to maintain control over the Indians and ensure their subordination. This implies that Simpson, like many other European colonizers, was focused on maintaining power and control over the native populations they encountered.",
