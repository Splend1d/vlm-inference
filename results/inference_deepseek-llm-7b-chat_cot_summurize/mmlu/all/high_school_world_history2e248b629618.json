Ivory\nB. Tobacco\nC. Silver\nD. Furs\n\nassistant:The author of the second passage, George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, is discussing the need to \"rule with a rod of iron\" the Indians in order to maintain their subordination. He believes that the most effective way to do this is by controlling the supply of foodstuffs and manufactured goods that the Indians need in order to survive. This suggests that he would be interested in obtaining resources from the local natives that are essential to their livelihood.\n\nConsidering the options provided, furs (option D) are the most likely resource that George Simpson would have been interested in obtaining from local natives. Furs were valuable commodities in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in Europe, where they were in high demand for their warmth and insulating properties. Fur traders, like the Hudson's Bay Company, would have needed to obtain these furs from the local indigenous communities in order to sell them to customers in Europe. Therefore, George Simpson's interest in ruling the Indians with a \"rod of iron\" would have likely been directed towards obtaining furs from them.\n\nIn contrast, options A (ivory), B (tobacco), and C (silver) were not as crucial to the survival or livelihood of the local indigenous communities as furs were. Ivory was not as important in the fur trade, as it was more of a luxury item than a necessity, and was not as prevalent in the Americas as it was in Africa. Tobacco, while a valuable resource for the colonists and Native Americans alike, was not as essential to the Indians' survival as furs were to the fur trade. Silver, while a valuable metal, was not as important to the Native Americans as furs were to the fur trade or as essential to their survival as food or other resources.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the two passages, the author of the second passage would have been most interested in obtaining furs from local natives to maintain their subordination and control over the Indians.",
