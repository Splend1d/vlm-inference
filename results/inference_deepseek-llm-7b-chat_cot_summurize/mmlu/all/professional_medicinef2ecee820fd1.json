Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\nA. collateral estoppel\nB. proximate cause\nC. res ipsa loquitur\nD. respondeat superior\n\nassistant:The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is B. proximate cause.\n\nIn the case of the patient with chronic pelvic pain after a hysterectomy, the proximate cause of her injury is the surgical sponge left in her pelvis after the procedure. The sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence, which is the proximate cause of her injury. Collateral estoppel, res ipsa loquitur, and respondeat superior are not applicable in this case. Collateral estoppel refers to the principle that a decision in one case bars another case involving the same parties or their claims, while res ipsa loquitur is a Latin phrase meaning \"the thing speaks for itself,\" which refers to a presumption of negligence when the accident or injury occurred through ordinary negligence. Respondeat superior is a legal doctrine that holds an employer liable for the actions of their employees, which is not applicable in this case.",
