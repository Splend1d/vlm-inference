Cardiovascular problems\nB. Loss of muscle strength\nC. Immune system decline\nD. Graying of hair\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Cardiovascular problems.\n\nStudies have shown that early cardiovascular problems can predict later cognitive decline. In fact, high blood pressure, heart disease, and other cardiovascular issues have been linked to an increased risk of developing dementia and other cognitive disorders.\n\nIt is important to note that while cardiovascular problems can be a risk factor for cognitive decline, there are many other factors that can also contribute to cognitive decline, such as genetics, lifestyle habits, and environmental factors.\n\nTo maintain good cognitive health, it is important to adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques. Additionally, staying mentally active through activities such as reading, playing games, and learning new skills can help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline.",
