It is formed of Purkinje fibres and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\n\nThe atrioventricular bundle is a bundle of Purkinje fibers that connects the atria to the ventricles. It is the primary pathway for conducting electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, ensuring that the heart beats in a coordinated and synchronized manner. The atrioventricular bundle is also known as the bundle of His.",
