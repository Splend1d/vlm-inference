The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n\nassistant:The man's best defense would be option C: The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance. This is because the woman's counter offer of $1,000 effectively terminated her power of acceptance, making the original offer of $800 invalid. The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer would also be a valid defense, but option C is the more appropriate choice in this case as it directly addresses the termination of the woman's power of acceptance.",
