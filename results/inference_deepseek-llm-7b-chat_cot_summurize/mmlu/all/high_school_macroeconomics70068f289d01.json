Assume an upward sloping aggregate supply curve.\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\nD. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease.\n\nassistant:If the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it means that the quantity of goods and services produced by businesses in the economy decreases. This is because businesses are producing less despite the same amount of inputs (labor and capital).\n\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it implies that the equilibrium price level increases. This is because when the quantity of goods and services produced decreases, the market forces the price level to increase to clear the market.\n\nHowever, the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. This is because the aggregate supply curve slopes downward, and when it shifts to the left, it implies a decrease in the quantity of goods and services produced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease.",
