The natural law fallacy is a specific type of false cause because it occurs when one assumes that because something has happened naturally, it is the cause of something else. For example, if a person's illness is caused by a natural phenomenon, such as an earthquake, it would be a natural law fallacy to assume that the earthquake caused the illness.",
