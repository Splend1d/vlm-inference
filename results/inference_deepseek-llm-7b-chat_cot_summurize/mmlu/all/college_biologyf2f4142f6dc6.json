Which of the following describes the change in the person\u2019s blood caused by this hyperventilation?\n\nA. A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions\nB.

An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions\nD. An increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions.\n\nWhen a person hyperventilates, they breathe too quickly, which causes the concentration of carbon dioxide in their blood to decrease. This decrease in carbon dioxide leads to an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions (also known as hydrogen ions or protons) in the blood. This change in the blood can cause a condition called respiratory alkalosis, which is characterized by a higher than normal pH in the blood.",
