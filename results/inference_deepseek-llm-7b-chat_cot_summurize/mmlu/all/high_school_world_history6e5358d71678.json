The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa\n\nassistant:The tone of the first letter, which describes the kidnapping of free and exempt men and noblemen for the purpose of selling them to white men in the Kingdoms, reflects a development in early modern Africa that highlights the negative impact of European trade and colonialism. This type of language and situation would be more indicative of a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods (Option A) rather than vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest (Option B), the establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline (Option C), or the consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa (Option D). Therefore, the correct answer is A. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods.",
