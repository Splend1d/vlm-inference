As a result, the seller held the legal title to the farm. The buyer's claim for a refund of his down payment is unlikely to be successful, as the contract was valid and binding. The buyer cannot back out of the contract due to a mere incident of fire, which did not affect the value or the quality of the property. The court is likely to rule in favor of the seller, and the buyer will be obliged to complete the contract.",
