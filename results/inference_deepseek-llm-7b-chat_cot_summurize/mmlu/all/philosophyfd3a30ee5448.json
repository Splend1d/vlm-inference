So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:\n\nA. would likewise be destroyed.\nB. would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\nC. would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\nD. would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. would likewise be destroyed. According to Aristotle, the essence or form of an individual is what makes it what it is, and this essence does not exist apart from the individual itself. Therefore, if all the members of a species were destroyed, their essence or form would also be destroyed, as it is tied to the individual that exists in the world.",
