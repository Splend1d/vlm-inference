Given a (finite) string w, is w a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0?\nThe decision problem for this question is whether there exists a decimal expansion of \u03c0 that starts with the given string w. This problem can be solved by checking every possible decimal expansion of \u03c0 that starts with the given string w, and determining whether it exists.\n\nII. Given a program and an input, is the program\u2019s output the decimal expansion of \u03c0?\nThe decision problem for this question is whether there exists a program that, when given a specific input, outputs the decimal expansion of \u03c0. This problem can be solved by checking every possible program and its corresponding input, and determining whether there exists a program that outputs the decimal expansion of \u03c0 given a specific input.\n\nIII. Given a program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0, is the program\u2019s output always the same for every prefix?\nThe decision problem for this question is whether there exists a program that, given a specific prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0, always outputs the same value. This problem can be solved by checking every possible program and its corresponding input, and determining whether there exists a program that outputs the same value for every prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0.\n\nBased on this analysis, all three problems are decidable. Therefore, the correct answer is D. I and II only.",
