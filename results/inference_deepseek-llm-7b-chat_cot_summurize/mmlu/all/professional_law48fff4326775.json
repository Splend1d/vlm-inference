Ignorant of the adversarial system, they both visited a family law attorney together for an initial consultation. The attorney advised them that he could not represent them both.

However, these privileges are not applicable in this situation. The husband and wife are already separated, so the spousal privilege does not apply. Additionally, the marital communication privilege would not apply because the wife is testifying about a confidential statement she made to her attorney, not to her husband.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege, which would prevent the wife's testimony from being admitted, is also not applicable. This privilege is only in place to protect confidential communications between a client and their attorney, and it does not extend to communications that the client makes to their spouse or other third parties.\n\nTherefore, the wife's testimony should be excluded as a privileged communication between the wife and her attorney.",
