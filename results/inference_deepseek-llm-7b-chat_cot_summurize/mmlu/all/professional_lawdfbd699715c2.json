The attorney for the woman's employer has moved to remand the entire case back to state court, which would have federal-question jurisdiction. Since the woman's attorney has timely removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction, the court is likely to retain the federal claims and remand the state claims back to state court.",
