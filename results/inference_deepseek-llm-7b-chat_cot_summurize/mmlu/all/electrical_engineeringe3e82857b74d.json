Sinusoidal wave\nB. Triangular wave\nC. Sawtooth wave\nD. Both B and C\n\nassistant:The question asks which type of wave is generated by relaxation voltage controlled oscillators. The answer is C, which means sawtooth wave.\n\nA voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is a type of oscillator that generates a periodic waveform that is controlled by an external voltage signal. The relaxation voltage controlled oscillator is a type of VCO that generates a sawtooth waveform.\n\nA sawtooth waveform is a type of non-sinusoidal waveform that has a jagged or saw-toothed appearance. It has a maximum positive and negative value, and it oscillates between these values. The waveform is not symmetrical and it has a lot of peaks and troughs.\n\nA sinusoidal wave, on the other hand, is a type of waveform that is symmetrical and has a smooth curve. It has a maximum positive and negative value and it oscillates between these values, but it is not as jagged as a sawtooth waveform.\n\nSo, the relaxation voltage controlled oscillator generates a sawtooth wave, not a sinusoidal wave.",
