We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n(5 over 8) * m = 6\n\n(5 over 8) * m = 6\n\n(5/8) * m = 6\n\nNow, to isolate m, we can divide both sides of the equation by (5/8):\n\n(5/8) * m / (5/8) = 6 / (5/8)\n\nm = 6 / (5/8)\n\nm = 6 * (8/5)\n\nm = 9.6\n\nNow that we have the value of m, we can check the answer options:\n\nA. 3 and 5 over 9\nB. 3 and 3 over 4\nC. 5 and 1 over 3\nD. 9 and 3 over 5\n\nNone of these options matches our answer of m = 9.6.
