The axon terminal plays a crucial role in transmitting signals from one neuron to another.\n\nThe cell body is the main part of a neuron where the nerve impulses are generated and transmitted to the dendrites and axon. It is not where synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins occurs.\n\nThe dendrite is a part of a neuron that receives signals from other neurons and transmits them to the cell body. It is also not where synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins occurs.\n\nTherefore, the part of the neuron that directs synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins is the axon terminal.",
