Neptune\nB. Mercury\nC. Mars\nD. Saturn\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will search for the information about the known moons of each planet and compare it with the user's options.\n\n1. I will start by retrieving the list of known moons for each of the planets:\n   - Neptune: Neptune has 14 known moons.\n   - Mercury: Mercury has no known moons.\n   - Mars: Mars has 2 known moons.\n   - Saturn: Saturn has 82 known moons.\n\n2. Next, I will compare the number of known moons for each planet with the user's options:\n   - Option A (Neptune) has 14 known moons, which is not the correct answer.\n   - Option B (Mercury) has no known moons, which is the correct answer.\n   - Option C (Mars) has 2 known moons, which is not the correct answer.\n   - Option D (Saturn) has 82 known moons, which is not the correct answer.\n\n3. Finally, I will present the correct answer to the user:\n   Mercury is the planet with no known moon.",
