Seventeen more bags will be delivered on Monday. Twenty-two bags will be delivered on Tuesday. Three bags will be delivered on Wednesday. Eleven bags will be delivered on Thursday. Lastly, eighteen bags will be delivered on Friday. By the end of the week, how many bags of bird feed will there be in total?\n\nA. 9\nB. 25\nC. 60\nD. 80\n\nassistant:To find the total number of bags of bird feed at the end of the week, we need to add up the number of bags that will be delivered each day and then add the remaining bags in the storage room.\n\nThe storage room has 9 bags, and there will be 17 more bags delivered on Monday, so 9 + 17 = 26 bags.\n\nThen, there will be 22 bags delivered on Tuesday, so 26 + 22 = 48 bags.\n\nOn Wednesday, there will be 3 bags delivered, so 48 + 3 = 51 bags.\n\nOn Thursday, there will be 11 bags delivered, so 51 + 11 = 62 bags.\n\nLastly, on Friday, there will be 18 bags delivered, so 62 + 18 = 80 bags.\n\nThe answer is D. 80 bags of bird feed will be in total at the end of the week.",
