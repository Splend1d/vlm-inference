This is known as the Appeal to Fear (Af) fallacy, which is a type of ad hominem fallacy. The Af fallacy is a logical fallacy that occurs when a person or group of people attempts to persuade others to take a certain action by appealing to their fears. This fallacy is often used to manipulate or frighten people into doing something that they might not otherwise do. The Af fallacy is often used to create a sense of urgency or danger, and to make the audience believe that not taking a certain action will lead to negative consequences. The Af fallacy is not a valid argument, as it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that the proposed action is necessary or beneficial.",
