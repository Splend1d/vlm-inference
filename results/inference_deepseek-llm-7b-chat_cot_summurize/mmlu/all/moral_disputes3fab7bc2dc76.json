However, it is not the only principle that leads to this conclusion.\n\nB. the principal principle: This principle is not mentioned in the question, and it does not directly justify the argument made in \"all animals are equal.\"\n\nC. the principle of double effect: This principle may argue that all animals should be equal because their suffering is a negative effect of their use in certain ways. However, it is not the only principle that leads to this conclusion.\n\nD. the principle of minimizing suffering: This principle may argue that all animals should be equal because their suffering should be minimized. It is the only principle that directly justifies the argument made in \"all animals are equal,\" as it flows from the principle of minimizing suffering.\n\nTherefore, according to Singer, the conclusions argued for in \"all animals are equal\" flow from the principle of minimizing suffering alone.",
