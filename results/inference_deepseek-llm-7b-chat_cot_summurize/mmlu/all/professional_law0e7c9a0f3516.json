Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe state Supreme Court has already ruled that the law is unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. Since the federal constitutional holding has already been made, it is unnecessary for the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the state constitutional decision as well. Instead, the court should affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below, and the U.S. Supreme Court should review the case on the merits.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court should not abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the state constitution does not need to substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue, as the U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to review the case and make its own determination.",
