Another computer is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every two minutes. Find the number of times in twenty-four hours that the two computers back up data at the same time. (Assume that the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period.)\n\nA. 144\nB. 12\nC. 6\nD. 36\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can first find the total number of backup operations performed by each computer in a 24-hour period, and then find the number of times when the two computers back up data at the same time.\n\n1. The first computer backs up data at the turn of the minute every 5 minutes. In a 24-hour period, there are 24 \\* 60 = 1440 minutes. So, the first computer backs up data 1440 / 5 = 288 times in a 24-hour period.\n2. The second computer backs up data at the turn of the minute every 2 minutes. In a 24-hour period, there are 24 \\* 60 = 1440 minutes. So, the second computer backs up data 1440 / 2 = 720 times in a 24-hour period.\n\nNow, let's find the number of times when the two computers back up data at the same time. We can do this by finding the common multiples of 288 and 720.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 288 and 720 is 288 \\* 720 = 219,680. This means that the two computers back up data at the same time 219,680 / 288 = 768 times in a 24-hour period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 12.",
