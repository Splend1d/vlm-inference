This system was first proposed by the Scottish antiquary James Y. Simpson in the 19th century. The Stone Age refers to the time when humans used tools and weapons made of stone. The Bronze Age is characterized by the use of bronze, a metal alloy that was harder and more durable than stone. The Iron Age is the time when humans began using iron, which was even stronger and more durable than bronze.",
