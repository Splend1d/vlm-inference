Unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets.\nD. Unrestricted net assets, restricted net assets, and total current assets.\n\nassistant:C. Unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets.\n\nThe statement of financial position for a not-for-profit organization, also known as a balance sheet, presents the organization's financial position at a specific point in time. It shows the organization's assets, liabilities, and net assets (also known as net position).\n\nTotal net assets in the statement of financial position include all types of net assets owned by the organization. In the case of a not-for-profit organization, these net assets are usually classified into three categories:\n\n1. Unrestricted net assets: These are the net assets that the organization can freely use for its stated mission without any restrictions from donors or other stakeholders.\n2. Temporarily restricted net assets: These are the net assets that the organization can use only for specific purposes or programs that have been designated by donors but will no longer be restricted after a specified period of time.\n3. Permanently restricted net assets: These are the net assets that the organization can use only for the specific purposes or programs that have been designated by donors and will continue to be restricted indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, which includes all three types of net assets: unrestricted, temporarily restricted, and permanently restricted net assets.",
