The sudden demise of the dinosaurs, and various other groups, by the impact of a large extraterrestrial body with Earth. This event is known as the \"K-T extinction\" and is believed to have occurred approximately 65 million years ago. The impact of the extraterrestrial object is thought to have caused a large release of energy and debris, which led to the extinction of many species, including the dinosaurs. This event is often cited as an example of a catastrophic event that can have a significant impact on the Earth's ecosystems.",
