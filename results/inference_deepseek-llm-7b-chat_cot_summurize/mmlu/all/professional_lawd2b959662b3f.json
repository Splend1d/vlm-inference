Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, builders and sellers of newly constructed homes are required to provide warranties to their buyers that the home was built in a good and workmanlike manner. This means that the builder-seller is responsible for any defects or issues that arise with the home within a certain period after the sale. In this case, the buyer is alleging that there are defects in the home that were not properly addressed by the builder-seller, and if the buyer's allegations are true, the court may hold the builder-seller liable to repair those defects at their own expense.",
