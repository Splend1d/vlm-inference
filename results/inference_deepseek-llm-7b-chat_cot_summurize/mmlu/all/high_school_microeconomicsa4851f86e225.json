This means that\n\nA. goods X and Y are normal goods.\nB. goods X and Y are inferior goods.\nC. goods X and Y are complementary goods.\nD. goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nThe cross-price elasticity of goods X and Y measures the percentage change in the quantity of good X demanded for each 1% change in the price of good Y. If the cross-price elasticity is positive, it means that the two goods are substitutes, as an increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in the demand for the other good. In this case, the cross-price elasticity is +2.0, which indicates a very strong positive relationship between the two goods, suggesting that they are highly complementary and that a small change in one good's price will lead to a large change in the other good's demand.",
