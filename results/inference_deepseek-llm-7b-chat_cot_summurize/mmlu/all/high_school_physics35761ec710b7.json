The charge distribution is not uniform. It may be correctly concluded that the\n\nA. electric field outside the object is zero\nB. the electric field outside the object is equal to the electric field inside the object\nC. the electric field outside the object is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object\nD. the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space\n\nassistant:The electric field outside a charged object can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = (\u03c3/\u03b5\u2080) \u00d7 r\n\nwhere E is the electric field, \u03c3 is the surface charge density, and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nIn this case, the charge distribution on the object is not uniform, so the surface charge density \u03c3 will be different at different points on the surface. When we consider the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, the electric field will be directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.",
