China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\nD. China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.\n\nassistant:The passage describes the actions of Europeans sending a poisonous drug, opium, to China, and it asks what has become of their conscience given that they know how hurtful opium is to mankind. The passage also mentions that China exports many products that are beneficial to mankind.\n\nOption A, the fact that China had placed an embargo on exports of silk, is not mentioned in the passage and does not provide a reason for Europeans to engage in the actions described.\n\nOption B, the price of Chinese tea having risen higher than European buyers found acceptable, does not explain why Europeans would engage in the actions described.\n\nOption C, China refusing to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there, is not mentioned in the passage and does not provide a reason for Europeans to engage in the actions described.\n\nOption D, the fact that China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador, is not mentioned in the passage and does not provide a reason for Europeans to engage in the actions described.\n\nTherefore, none of the background facts mentioned in the passage persuades Europeans to engage in the actions described.",
