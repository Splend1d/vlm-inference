The college student allegedly started the fight when he struck the man in the head with a pool cue after the man sank a game-winning shot. At the college student's trial for assault, the prosecution called one of the college student's classmates to testify. The classmate was not at the bar during the fight. The classmate offered to testify that the next day at class, he approached the college student and said, \"It was wrong of you to start a fight with the man over a game of pool,\" at which point, the college student bowed his head and walked away. The classmate's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as part of the res gestae.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible as self-serving.\n\nassistant:C. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nThe classmate's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay because he was not present at the scene of the incident and did not witness the events that occurred. Hearsay is a statement that someone makes about a fact that they did not see or experience firsthand. Since the classmate did not witness the fight or the events leading up to it, his testimony is considered hearsay and is not admissible in court.\n\nA. Admissible as part of the res gestae: This option is incorrect because the classmate's testimony is not admissible as part of the res gestae. The res gestae exception allows for the introduction of statements made in the heat of the moment immediately following a crime. In this case, the classmate's statement was made the next day, and not in the immediate aftermath of the incident.\n\nB. Admissible as an admission: This option is incorrect because the classmate's testimony is not an admission by the college student. An admission is a statement made by a party that admits to committing a crime or acknowledging responsibility for it. In this case, the classmate's statement does not constitute an admission by the college student.\n\nD. Inadmissible as self-serving: This option is incorrect because the classmate's testimony is not considered self-serving. Self-serving statements are those made by a party with a motive to deceive or mislead the court. In this case, the classmate's statement does not appear to have a motive to deceive or mislead the court.",
