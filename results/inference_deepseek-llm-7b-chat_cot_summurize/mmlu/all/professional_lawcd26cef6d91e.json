This action constitutes a breach of the lease agreement, which allows the landlord (in this case, the Girl Scouts of America) to take legal action to regain possession of the property.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the lease with the tenant does not specify that the tenant would sublease the property during his absence. Option C is incorrect because the tenant's belief that the lease was still in effect after the landowner's death does not negate the fact that he stopped paying rent, which is a breach of the lease agreement. Option D is incorrect because the tenant's failure to pay taxes on the property does not affect the Girl Scouts' claim to ownership.",
