The presence of premodern Homo sapiens can be inferred from the presence of their tools, bones, and other artifacts in archaeological sites.\n\nThe time period you provided corresponds to the following:\n\nA. 800,000 to 200,000 years ago: This is the time period when Homo sapiens originated and evolved, but it is unlikely that premodern Homo sapiens existed during this time.\n\nB. 600,000 to 30,000 years ago: This is the time period when Homo erectus, a species of archaic human, lived. Homo erectus is believed to be the direct ancestor of modern humans, and it is likely that premodern Homo sapiens coexisted with Homo erectus.\n\nC. 400,000 to 10,000 years ago: This is the time period when Homo heidelbergensis, a species of archaic human, lived. Homo heidelbergensis is believed to be the direct ancestor of both modern humans and Neanderthals, and it is likely that premodern Homo sapiens coexisted with Homo heidelbergensis.\n\nD. 100,000 to 10,000 years ago: This is the time period when the Neanderthals, a species of archaic human, lived. It is likely that premodern Homo sapiens coexisted with the Neanderthals.\n\nIn summary, premodern Homo sapiens existed and coexisted with modern humans and other archaic human species for thousands of years before the widespread dispersal of modern humans.",
