The simplest alkene, which is also known as an alkane, has only one carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, it does not have at least two pi bonds (option A) or at least four sigma bonds (option B). Additionally, it does not have a tetrahedral configuration (option C), as alkanes are generally considered to have a planar structure. However, it does have cis-trans isomers, which means that it can exist in two different geometric configurations. These isomers are called cis and trans, where cis refers to the isomers where the double bond lies between two adjacent carbon atoms, and trans refers to the isomers where the double bond lies between two non-adjacent carbon atoms.",
