In this case, both options 1 and 2 involve the reduction of copper ions (Cu2+). Option 1 describes the reduction of copper(II) ions to copper(I) ions, while option 2 describes the reduction of copper(I) ions to copper(0) ions (i.e., copper metal). Both of these reactions involve the reduction of copper ions, so options 1 and 2 are both reduction half-reactions. Option 3, which describes the reduction of iron(II) ions to iron(III) ions, is not a reduction half-reaction because it does not involve the reduction of a metal ion.",
