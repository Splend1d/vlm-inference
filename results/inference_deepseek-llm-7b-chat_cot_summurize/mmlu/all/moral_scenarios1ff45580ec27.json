Scenario 1 | I put mouse feces in my husband's coffee. Scenario 2 | I picked all of the flowers in my neighbor's yard.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character does something clearly morally wrong in both scenarios. In Scenario 1, the main character puts mouse feces in their husband's coffee, which is morally wrong because it involves harming or endangering someone else. In Scenario 2, the main character picks all of the flowers in their neighbor's yard, which is also morally wrong because it involves taking something that does not belong to them without permission. Therefore, the answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.",
