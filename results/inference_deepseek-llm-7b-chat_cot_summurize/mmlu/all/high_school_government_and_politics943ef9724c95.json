I. America's increased prominence in international affairs II. continually improved public confidence in the federal government III. the New Deal and other programs that have expanded federal responsibility IV. the president's increased visibility, due to the development of mass media\n\nA. I only\nB. I and IV only\nC. I, III, and IV only\nD. II and IV only\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C, which means that all of the options I, III, and IV are correct in explaining the growth of the president's power and prestige since 1932. Here is a more detailed explanation:\n\nI. America's increased prominence in international affairs: As the United States became a major global power, it became necessary for the president to be involved in international affairs, such as diplomacy, trade, and defense. This increased the importance of the presidency and gave the president more power.\n\nIII. the New Deal and other programs that have expanded federal responsibility: The New Deal was a series of programs that were created to address the economic problems of the Great Depression. The president was responsible for implementing these programs, which required him to have more power and influence over the federal government.\n\nIV. the president's increased visibility, due to the development of mass media: With the advent of television and other mass media, the president became more visible to the public, which increased his power and influence. People were able to see him in action and became more aware of his role in the government.\n\nOption B, which includes only options I and IV, is incorrect because it does not take into account the other factors that have contributed to the growth of the president's power and prestige. Option D, which includes only options II and IV, is also incorrect because it does not include the other factors that have contributed to the growth of the president's power and prestige.",
