One estimates a VAR(6), while the other estimates a VAR(4). The determinants of the variance-covariance matrices of the residuals for each VAR are 0.0036 and 0.0049 respectively.

The test statistic for this test is given by the following formula:\n\ntest_statistic = (R^2 - 1/n) \\* (k_max - k) / (k_max \\* (k_max - 1))\n\nwhere R^2 is the estimated value of the coefficient of determination, n is the number of observations, k is the number of variables, and k_max is the maximum order of the VAR.\n\nIn this case, R^2 = 0.9999999999999999 (since it is close to 1), n = 250, k = 3, and k_max = 6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ntest_statistic = (0.9999999999999999 - 1/250) \\* (6 - 3) / (6 \\* (6 - 1))\ntest_statistic = (0.9999999999999999 - 1/250) \\* 3 / (6 \\* 5)\ntest_statistic = (0.9999999999999999 - 1/5000) \\* 1.5\ntest_statistic = 1.5 - 0.0003999999999999999\ntest_statistic = 1.5003999999999998\n\nSince the test statistic is not equal to any of the answer choices, the correct answer is not listed in the options. However, the value of the test statistic is approximately 1.5004.",
