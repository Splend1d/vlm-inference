Team building activities involving learning\n\nassistant:T-group training is an approach to group training that focuses on transformative change and personal growth. It is a collaborative process that encourages participants to explore their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and to use this understanding to make positive changes in their lives. T-group training is designed to help individuals develop their emotional intelligence, communication skills, and self-awareness, and to promote a sense of community and shared purpose among the group members. The approach was developed by American psychologist Rollo May in the 1940s and has been used in a variety of settings, including education, business, and social service organizations.",
