The operator wants to launch a ball from a cannon so the ball goes as far as possible before hitting the level surface. The muzzle velocity of the cannon is 50 m/s. At what angle from the horizontal should the operator point the cannon?\n\nA. 5\u00b0\nB. 41\u00b0\nC. 45\u00b0\nD. 49\u00b0\n\nassistant:Let's use the following formulas to solve this problem:\n\n1. Horizontal range = Speed \u00d7 Time\n2. Vertical range = Speed \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Gravity\n3. Angle = Arc length / Radius\n\nFirst, let's find the horizontal range:\nHorizontal range = Speed \u00d7 Time\nHorizontal range = (50 m/s) \u00d7 5 s\nHorizontal range = 250 m\n\nNow, let's find the vertical range:\nVertical range = Speed \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Gravity\nVertical range = (50 m/s) \u00d7 5 s \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2\nVertical range = 245 m\n\nSince the ball will hit the surface, the angle should be 45\u00b0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 45\u00b0.",
