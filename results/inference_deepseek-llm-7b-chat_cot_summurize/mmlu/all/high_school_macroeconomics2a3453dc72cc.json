Instead, it is a curve that shows the total amount of goods and services produced in an economy and the total amount of money people are willing to spend on those goods and services.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the aggregate demand curve is not a horizontal summation of firm demand curves. Instead, it is a curve that shows the total amount of goods and services produced in an economy and the total amount of money people are willing to spend on those goods and services.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the aggregate demand curve is not a simple aggregation of demand curves for individual goods. Instead, it is a curve that shows the total amount of goods and services produced in an economy and the total amount of money people are willing to spend on those goods and services.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the aggregate demand curve is not not found by adding product demand curves horizontally or vertically.

The aggregate demand curve is a horizontal summation of market demand curves.",
