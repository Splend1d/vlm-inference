It is a__________ firm.\n\nA. Consultant.\nB. Field agency.\nC. Full-service agency.\nD. Tabulation agency.\n\nassistant:A. Consultant.\n\nA marketing research firm that contracts with clients to conduct a complete marketing research project from data collection, analysis, and reporting is a consultant firm. They provide expert advice and guidance to clients on various aspects of the marketing research process, including data collection, analysis, and reporting. This type of firm is typically hired by clients who need help with a specific aspect of their marketing research project and do not have the resources or expertise to handle it in-house.\n\nB. Field agency is incorrect because a field agency is responsible for the data collection and fieldwork portion of a marketing research project, not the entire project from data collection to reporting.\n\nC. Full-service agency is incorrect because a full-service agency provides a wide range of marketing services, including strategy, creative, media, digital, and research, but does not specifically focus on conducting a complete marketing research project.\n\nD. Tabulation agency is incorrect because a tabulation agency is responsible for organizing and analyzing the data collected by a field agency, not conducting the entire marketing research project from data collection to reporting.",
