She has a fee simple.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The conveyance gives the niece nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to his wife's cousin. The man's initial conveyance to his wife's cousin created a fee simple estate, which means the cousin has an estate interest that will continue until the death of the cousin or until it is lost due to some other reason. The subsequent conveyance to the niece does not affect the original conveyance to the cousin, so the niece does not gain any interest in the property.",
