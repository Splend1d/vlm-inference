He argues that good is that which we desire, and this desire is what gives something its value. This contrasts with other philosophical views, such as Aristotle's view that good is the mean between extremes, or Kant's view that good is the moral law.\n\nMoore's view has been criticized by other philosophers, who argue that desire is not a reliable guide to what is truly good or valuable. However, Moore's argument is still a significant and influential part of the history of ethical philosophy.",
