These projections increase the surface area for absorption, allowing for better reabsorption of nutrients and other substances.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because decreasing the surface area of the small intestine would reduce the efficiency of nutrient absorption. Answer C and D are also incorrect because increasing the surface area of the small intestine does not make it more hydrophilic (water-loving) or hydrophobic (water-repelling).",
