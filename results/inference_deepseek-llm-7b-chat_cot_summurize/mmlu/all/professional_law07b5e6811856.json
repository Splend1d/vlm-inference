The shopper has sued the mall owner for negligence. At trial, the shopper's housekeeper testified that the shopper was bedridden and unable to work for a month because of the sprained back she suffered when she fell at the mall. The housekeeper also testified that about one week after the shopper returned home from the hospital, the shopper told her, \"My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again. \" The mall's counsel then moved to strike the housekeeper's testimony. The motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the housekeeper's testimony is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. granted, because the housekeeper's testimony would be self-serving.\nC. denied, because the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible as an adoptive admission.\nD. denied, because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. denied, because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nExplanation: The statement made by the shopper to her housekeeper is considered an \"admission in evidence\" or a declaration of present bodily condition. This type of statement is admissible as evidence in a trial to show the condition of the plaintiff at a specific time. In this case, the statement would help demonstrate the extent of the shopper's injuries and their impact on her daily life, which is relevant to the negligence claim against the mall owner.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the statement is not hearsay if it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as an admission in evidence or a statement of present bodily condition. Answer B is incorrect because the housekeeper's testimony is not necessarily self-serving; her statement about the shopper's condition could be considered objective evidence. Answer C is incorrect because the statement would not be admissible as an adoptive admission, which is a specific exception to the hearsay rule.",
