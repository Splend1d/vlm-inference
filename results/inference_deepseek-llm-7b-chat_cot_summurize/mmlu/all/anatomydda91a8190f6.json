The medulla oblongata is a vital center located in the brainstem, which plays a crucial role in controlling basic life functions such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The midbrain, pons, and cerebellum are also parts of the brainstem, but they do not serve the same essential functions as the medulla oblongata.",
