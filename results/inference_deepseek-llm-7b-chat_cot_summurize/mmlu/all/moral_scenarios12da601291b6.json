Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I cannot determine the moral standard for all people in all situations, but I can provide you with the likelihood of each scenario being morally wrong according to common moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Giving flowers to your mom might be seen as a normal and polite gesture. However, giving flowers to your wife might be seen as a sign of infidelity, depending on the context. Therefore, the main character might do something morally wrong in both scenarios.\n\nScenario 2: Hugging your best friend's wife might be considered inappropriate or disrespectful, especially if your best friend has a strong emotional connection with their wife. In this scenario, the main character might do something morally wrong.\n\nBased on the likelihood of the main character doing something morally wrong in both scenarios, the answer would be:\n\nA.
