Which of the following DNA segments would be the result of this original DNA sequence experiencing both a point mutation and a deletion?\n\nA. 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\nB. 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019\nC. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019\nD. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019\n\nassistant:To determine the result of a point mutation and a deletion in the original DNA sequence, we need to identify the change in the sequence and account for the missing nucleotides.\n\nThe original DNA sequence is: 5' - GGATCCTCATG - 3'\n\n1. Point mutation: A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide. We need to find out which nucleotide has changed and what the new nucleotide is.\n\n2. Deletion: A deletion is the loss of nucleotides from the DNA sequence. We need to identify the number of nucleotides missing and what nucleotides were removed.\n\nThe correct answer is D: 5' - GGATCCATG - 3'.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Point mutation:\n- The original sequence has a guanine (G) at position 3 (5' - GGATCCTCATG - 3').\n- The new sequence has a guanine (G) at position 2 (5' - GGATCCATG - 3').\n- This is a transition from guanine (G) to cytosine (C), which is a common point mutation.\n\n2. Deletion:\n- The original sequence has a total of 11 nucleotides (5' - GGATCCTCATG - 3').\n- The new sequence has a total of 9 nucleotides (5' - GGATCCATG - 3').\n- Therefore, there are 2 nucleotides missing from the original sequence (CCT and CAT).\n\nThe DNA sequence resulting from the point mutation and deletion is:\n5' - GGATCC - CAT - G - 3'\n\nTo account for the missing nucleotides, we add the complementary nucleotides to the ends of the sequence:\n\n5' - GGATCC - CAT - G - 3'\n5' - GGATCC - CAT - G - 3'\n\n5' - GGATCC - CAT - G - 3'\n\nThe new DNA sequence is:\n5' - GGATCCATG - 3'",
