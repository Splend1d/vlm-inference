In the middle of his five-mile race, Jerome grabs water from the water station to quench his thirst.\nB. Ernest gobbles a few cookies on his way to class because he did not have time for lunch.\nC. Tish decides to skip lunch because she is still full from eating a very large breakfast.\nD. Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway.\n\nassistant:Drive-reduction theories are a framework that describe the reasons why people eat, and the psychological and physiological processes that influence appetite. The framework consists of two main theories: drive theory and reduction theory.\n\nDrive theory suggests that people eat in order to satisfy certain physiological needs, such as hunger and thirst. In this case, Jerome grabbing water from the water station, Ernest eating cookies, Tish skipping lunch, and Kezia ordering the strawberry cheesecake are all examples of drive-related behaviors. These behaviors are driven by the need to satisfy physiological drives, such as hunger, thirst, or the desire for energy or pleasure.\n\nOn the other hand, reduction theory suggests that people eat in order to reduce unpleasant feelings or to cope with negative emotions. In this case, eating as a way to cope with stress or boredom is an example of reduction-related behavior.\n\nGiven this framework, the question asks for the option that would not provide a reasonable explanation using drive-reduction theories. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. Ernest gobbling a few cookies on his way to class because he did not have time for lunch.\n\nThis behavior is not necessarily driven by physiological needs (hunger or thirst), but rather by the need to cope with stress or the lack of time for lunch. Therefore, this option does not provide a reasonable explanation using drive-reduction theories.",
