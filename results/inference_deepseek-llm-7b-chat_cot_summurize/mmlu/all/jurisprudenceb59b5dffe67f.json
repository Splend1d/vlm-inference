That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nassistant:John Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason on the grounds that natural law corresponds to positive law (option A). Finnis argues that Hume's idea of practical reason as a matter of subjective desire or interest is inadequate, as it does not take into account the objective moral law that exists independently of human desires or interests. Finnis believes that the natural law, which is based on reason and universal moral principles, is more comprehensive and coherent than Hume's conception. He also criticizes Hume's belief in the separation of ethics from law, as Finnis argues that the two are closely related and that the natural law is a fundamental part of the legal system.",
