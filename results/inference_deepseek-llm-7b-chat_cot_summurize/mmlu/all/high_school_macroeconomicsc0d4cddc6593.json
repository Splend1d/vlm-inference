Contractionary monetary policy is a policy where a central bank increases the discount rate, nominal interest rate, and reduces aggregate demand. This policy is used to control inflation, stabilize the economy, and promote economic growth.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\nA. Decreases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreases\nB. Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreases\nC.

Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases\n\nWe can see that option A and B have the discount rate and nominal interest rate in opposite directions. However, the discount rate and nominal interest rate are directly related to each other. Therefore, the correct answer should have the same direction for both the discount rate and nominal interest rate.\n\nOption C has the discount rate and nominal interest rate in the same direction, but it also has aggregate demand decreasing, which is not correct as contractionary monetary policy increases aggregate demand.\n\nOption D has the discount rate and nominal interest rate in the same direction and also has aggregate demand increasing, which is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases.",
