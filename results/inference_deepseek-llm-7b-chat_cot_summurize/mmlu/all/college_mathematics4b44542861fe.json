Call the set of matrices from V into itself M(V). Let T be in M(V). Consider the two subspaces U = {X \u2208 M(V) : TX = XT} and W = {TX \u2212 XT : X \u2208 M(V)}. Which of the following must be TRUE?\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).\nII. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\nIII. dim (U) < n\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. I and II only\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).\nSince U is a subspace, it is closed under the vector addition and scalar multiplication. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then any vector in V can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. Therefore, any vector in U can be expressed as a linear combination of eigenvectors of T, which means that U is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of T. Since eigenvectors of T are also in M(V), U is a subset of M(V). However, we cannot conclude that U = M(V) in general, since there might be other vectors in V that are not eigenvectors of T.\n\nII. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\nSince U is a subspace, its dimension is at most n. Since W is also a subspace, its dimension is at most n. Therefore, the sum of the dimensions of U and W is at most 2n. However, we cannot conclude that it is equal to n^2, since there might be other subspaces of dimension less than n.\n\nIII. dim (U) < n\nSince U is a subspace of M(V), its dimension is at most n. Therefore, the dimension of U is less than or equal to n. However, we cannot conclude that it is strictly less than n, since there might be other subspaces of dimension equal to n.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that statement I cannot be true, statement II cannot be true, and statement III cannot be true. Therefore, the answer is D. I and II only.",
