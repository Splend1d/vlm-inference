The blue light is scattered in all directions, while other colors of light, such as red and orange, are absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere in a way that they do not reach our eyes. Therefore, the sky appears blue. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. the atmosphere absorbs mostly blue light: This is not true. The atmosphere absorbs mostly red and orange light, which is why the sky appears orange or pink at sunrise or sunset.\n\nC. molecules scatter red light more effectively than blue light: This is also incorrect. Molecules in the atmosphere scatter all colors of light equally, which is why the sky appears blue, not red or orange.\n\nD. molecules scatter blue light more effectively than red light: This is even more incorrect. As explained earlier, molecules scatter all colors of light equally, which is why the sky appears blue, not red or orange.",
