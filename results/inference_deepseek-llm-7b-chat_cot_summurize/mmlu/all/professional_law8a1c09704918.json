Therefore, the transcript can be admitted as evidence under the general hearsay exception, which allows the admission of out-of-court statements if they are offered for a limited purpose, such as proving the truth of the matter asserted. The fact that the transcript bears a seal above the registrar's signature and the information about the defendant on the transcript has been corroborated by a government witness further supports its trustworthiness.",
