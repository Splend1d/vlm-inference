Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated.\nD. Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties.\n\nassistant:The two letters provided discuss the trade relations between Portugal and Kongo. In the first source, King Afonso I of Kongo complains about the inconvenience caused by Portuguese traders who kidnap his people, including noblemen and relatives, to sell them to white men in their kingdoms. In the second source, King Manuel of Portugal instructs his envoy in Kongo to make the King of Kongo understand that he should fill the ships with either slaves, copper, or ivory, and that the main purpose of the expedition is to serve God and the King of Kongo, but also to make a profit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the letters do not suggest that diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial.\nOption C is incorrect because there is no mention of highly regulated trade in the letters.\nOption D is incorrect because the letters do not suggest that trade between the two parties was brisk.\n\nOption B states that \"Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.\" This conclusion is supported by the two letters as they both mention the kidnapping of freed and exempt men, including noblemen, by the Portuguese traders.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.",
