Esprit de corps\nB. Initiative\nC. Order\nD. Individualism\n\nassistant:To find the answer to this question, I will look up Fayol's 14 principles of management and identify which one does not match the given options.\n\nHenri Fayol identified 14 principles of management, which include:\n\n1. Division of work\n2. Authority\n3. Discipline\n4. Unity of command\n5. Unity of direction\n6. Subordination of individual interests to general interests\n7. Remuneration\n8. Centralization\n9. Formalization\n10. Equity\n11. Stability of tenure of personnel\n12. Initiative\n13. Esprit de corps\n14. Laissez-faire\n\nThe principle that does not form one of Fayol's 14 principles of management is \"Laissez-faire\". This term refers to a management style where the manager gives employees a lot of freedom and autonomy, allowing them to make their own decisions without much guidance or oversight. This principle is not included in Fayol's 14 principles, as it is more of a management philosophy rather than a specific principle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Individualism.",
