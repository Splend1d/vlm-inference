Solvent A has a vapor pressure of 345 torr at room temperature. At the same temperature, solvent B has a vapor pressure of 213 torr. What is the vapor pressure of a mixture where the mole fraction of A is 0.285?\n\nA. 213 torr\nB. 345 torr\nC. 568 torr\nD. 251 torr\n\nassistant:The vapor pressure of a binary solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. This equation relates the pH of a solution to the concentrations of its components and is based on the concept of acid dissociation constants (pKa) and base dissociation constants (pKb).\n\nThe vapor pressure of a binary solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation as follows:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere\nP is the vapor pressure of the solution\nV is the volume of the solution\nn is the number of moles of solute in the solution\nR is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)\nT is the temperature of the solution in Kelvin\n\nThe mole fraction of solute A in the solution is given by:\n\nx_A = n_A / (n_A + n_B)\n\nwhere\nn_A is the number of moles of solute A in the solution\nn_B is the number of moles of solute B in the solution\n\nSubstituting the mole fraction of solute A into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we get:\n\nP_A = (n_A / (n_A + n_B)) * R * T\n\nSince the mole fraction of solute A is given as 0.285, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nP_A = (0.285) * (R * T)\n\nNow we need to find the vapor pressure of solute B (P_B). We can use the equation PV = nRT and solve for P_B:\n\nn_B = PV / R * T\n\nSince the vapor pressure of solute B is given as 213 torr, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nn_B = 213 / R * T\n\nNow we can solve for the vapor pressure of the mixture:\n\nP_A + P_B = 0.285 * (R * T) + 213 / R * T\n\nSince the vapor pressures of solvents A and B are given as 345 and 213 torr respectively, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n345 + 213 = 0.285 * (R * T) + 213 / R * T\n\nNow we can solve for T:\n\nR * T = (345 - 213) / 0.285\nR * T = 132 / 0.285\nR * T = 458.93 K\n\nNow we can find the vapor pressure of the mixture:\n\nP_A + P_B = 0.285 * (R * T) + 213 / R * T\nP_A + P_B = 0.285 * 458.93 + 213 / 1.987\nP_A + P_B = 134.08 + 110.6\nP_A + P_B = 244.68 torr\n\nTherefore, the vapor pressure of the mixture where the mole fraction of A is 0.285 is 244.68 torr.",
