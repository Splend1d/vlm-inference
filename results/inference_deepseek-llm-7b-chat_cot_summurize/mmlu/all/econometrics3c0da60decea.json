Stationary process\nB. Unit root process\nC. Explosive process\nD. Stationary and unit root process\n\nassistant:A stationary process is a time series that has constant mean, variance, and autocorrelation over time. A unit root process, on the other hand, has a non-zero autocorrelation at one lag.\n\nGiven the AR(2) process:\n\nyt = 1.5yt-1 - 0.5yt-2 + ut\n\nWe can see that this process has non-zero autocorrelation at one lag (yt-1), which means it has a unit root. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Unit root process",
