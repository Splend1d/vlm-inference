You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Using this formula, if a reaction was provided with 84g of ethane and unlimited oxygen, how many grams of carbon dioxide would result (Carbon atomic weight: 12amu, Hydrogen atomic weight: 1amu, Oxygen atomic weight: 16amu)?\n\ufeff\nThe unbalanced reaction of ethane gas to carbon dioxide and water is as follows:\n\n C2H4 + O2 \u2014> CO2 + H2O\n\nA. 78g\nB. 528g\nC. 264g\nD. 156g\n\nassistant:To determine the amount of carbon dioxide produced when 84g of ethane react with unlimited oxygen, we can use the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation:\n\nC2H4 + O2 \u2192 CO2 + H2O\n\nFirst, we'll need to convert the atomic weights to amu (atomic mass units):\n- Carbon (C) atomic weight: 12 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H) atomic weight: 1 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O) atomic weight: 16 g/mol\n\nNext, we'll use the balanced equation to determine the ratio of moles of reactants to products:\n\nC2H4 / CO2 = 2 / 1\nH2O / H2O = 1 / 1\n\nO2 / O2 = 1 / 1\n\nSince the oxygen is in excess, it will completely react with the ethane. We can now find the moles of ethane (C2H4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) using the balanced equation:\n\nC2H4 / (12g/mol) = 2 moles\n\nH2O / (2g/mol) = 2 moles\n\nO2 / (16g/mol) = 2 moles\n\nNow we can calculate the moles of ethane:\n\n2 moles of C2H4 = 2 moles of H2O + 2 moles of O2\n\n2 moles of C2H4 = 4 moles of H2O + 4 moles of O2\n\n2 moles of C2H4 = 2 moles of H2O + 2 moles of O2\n\nThus, there are 2 moles of ethane.\n\nNext, we can find the moles of carbon dioxide using the balanced equation:\n\nC2H4 + O2 \u2192 CO2 + H2O\n\n2 moles of C2H4 = x moles of CO2 + 4 moles of H2O\n\nNow, we can use the stoichiometry to find the moles of CO2:\n\n2 moles of ethane / x moles of carbon dioxide = 4 moles of water / 4 moles of water\n\n1 mol of C2H4 = 1 mol of CO2\n\nThus, there are 2 moles of ethane and 2 moles of carbon dioxide.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of the resulting carbon dioxide:\n\n2 moles of CO2 \u00d7 12 g/mol = 24 g of carbon dioxide\n\nTherefore, the answer is 24 g of carbon dioxide.",
