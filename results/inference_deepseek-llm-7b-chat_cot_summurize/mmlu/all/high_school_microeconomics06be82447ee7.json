Regressive tax.\n\nSales tax is a regressive tax because it imposes a fixed percentage on the total amount spent, regardless of the individual's income or wealth. This means that low-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income on sales tax than high-income individuals.\n\nProgressive taxes, proportional taxes, and excise taxes are not applicable in this context. Progressive taxes are levied on income or wealth at higher rates for higher-income individuals, while proportional taxes are based on a fixed percentage of a specific amount, such as income or property value. Excise taxes are taxes on specific goods or activities, such as fuel or tobacco.",
