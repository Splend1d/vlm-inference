This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim should be accepted based solely on the evidence that the person making the argument possesses favorable characteristics that enable them to understand the truth of the claim. In other words, the person is appealing to their own pride or ego, rather than to any objective evidence or reasoning. This fallacy is also known as the \"appeal to self-interest\" or the \"appeal to the person making the argument.\"",
