These species typically have a higher survival rate and are more likely to reproduce at a faster rate than other species.\n\nB. small body size\n\nSmall body size is a characteristic of r-selected species, as they are more efficient in terms of energy and space usage. Smaller bodies require less energy and resources to maintain, allowing them to better adapt to their environment.\n\nC. occupancy of unstable environments\n\nR-selected species are typically found in unstable environments, as they are more adaptable and can quickly adapt to changing conditions. They are also more likely to be found in environments with high levels of competition, as they are more competitive and can quickly take advantage of opportunities.\n\nD. high competitive ability\n\nHigh competitive ability is a characteristic of r-selected species, as they are more successful in competing for resources and space with other species. They are also more likely to be found in environments with high levels of competition, as they are more competitive and can quickly take advantage of opportunities.",
