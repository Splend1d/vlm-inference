The state adopted the so-called \"disaffiliation\" statute in order to have intraparty feuds resolved in primary elections rather than in the general election. Moreover, the state's elections director strongly supported the law and argued that it was necessary to avoid voter confusion and to ensure that the general election winner received a majority. A man, who was a registered Democrat in 2008, now wishes to run as an independent candidate in the November, 2009, general election. However, the elections director ruled that his candidacy violated the state's \"disaffiliation\" statute and barred him from appearing on the ballot. If the man files suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nC. The man must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nD. The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n\nThe burden of persuasion, also known as the burden of proof, refers to the responsibility of the party asserting a claim or position to prove its validity. In this case, the man is challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, meaning he must prove that the law is unconstitutional.\n\nTo be considered unconstitutional, a law must not be rationally related to a legitimate state interest under the fundamental rights analysis. This means that the state must show that the law is necessary to further an important state interest. If the state cannot demonstrate this, then the law is deemed unconstitutional.\n\nIn this case, the state must show that the \"disaffiliation\" statute is rationally related to an important state interest. If the state cannot show this, then the man's claim that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest will succeed. Therefore, the man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n\nA, B, and C are incorrect because they refer to different aspects of the burden of persuasion. A refers to the state's responsibility under the equal protection analysis, which is not applicable in this case. B refers to the state's responsibility under the fundamental rights analysis, but it is the man who must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest, not the state. C refers to the state's responsibility under the fundamental rights analysis, but it is the man who must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest, not the state.",
