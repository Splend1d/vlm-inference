They are derived from monocytes and differentiate into osteoclasts in the bone marrow. These cells have large, cup-shaped structures called resorption pits on their surface, which they use to break down bone tissue. They also deposit bone matrix in the process of resorption, which helps to form new bone tissue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because osteoclasts do not differentiate from periosteal mesenchymal cells. Option C is incorrect because osteoclasts do not differentiate from monocytes. Option D is incorrect because osteoclasts do not resorb bone and differentiate from monocytes.",
