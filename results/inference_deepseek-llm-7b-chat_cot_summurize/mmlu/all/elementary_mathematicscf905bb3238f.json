The total number of students is 762, and there are 6 teams.\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\n762 students / 6 teams = number of students per team\n\nNow we can solve for the number of students per team:\n\n762 students / 6 teams = 127 students per team\n\nThe correct answer is C. 127 students per team.",
