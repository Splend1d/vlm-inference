This exemplifies\n\nA. foot-in-the-door phenomenon\nB. social loafing\nC. social facilitation\nD. the bystander effect\n\nassistant:The behavior described in the prompt can be better understood as social facilitation.\n\nSocial facilitation is a psychological concept that describes the phenomenon where an individual's performance is enhanced or inhibited when performing a task in the presence of others. In this case, the pastry chef's performance is enhanced when culinary arts students are watching him, as he is able to make more apple turnovers in a given time period. On the other hand, the presence of students appears to inhibit the chef's performance when he is performing the task alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. social facilitation.",
