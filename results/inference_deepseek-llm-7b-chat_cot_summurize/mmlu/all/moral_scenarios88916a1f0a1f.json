This action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves using potentially harmful makeup on a child for a costume.\n\nThe main character in Scenario 2 is someone who likes Bill and doesn't know him, and they are trying to see if there are any sparks between them by kissing him. This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is a harmless and consensual action between two people who may or may not be interested in each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.
