Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character knowingly gives the patron regular coffee instead of decaf, which is considered morally wrong because they are intentionally misleading the patron.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character hands their brother the toilet brush to clean his teeth, which may not be the most hygienic choice, but it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
