(n-1)/n\n\nassistant:Let's calculate the figure of merit for each type of interconnection.\n\n1. Fully Interconnected Network (n processors, each connected to every other processor):\nNumber of links required: n(n-1)/2\nWorst-case path length: n-1\nFigure of merit: (n(n-1)/2) * (n-1) = n(n-1)(n-2)/4\n\n2. Ring Network (n processors, each connected to two other processors):\nNumber of links required: n(n-1)\nWorst-case path length: 1 (since each processor is connected to two other processors)\nFigure of merit: n(n-1) * 1 = n^2 - n\n\nNow let's compare the figures of merit for even values of n > 2:\n\nFor n = 4:\nFully Interconnected Network: (4(4-1)(4-2)/4) = 12\nRing Network: 4^2 - 4 = 12\n\nFor n = 6:\nFully Interconnected Network: (6(6-1)(6-2)/4) = 36\nRing Network: 6^2 - 6 = 30\n\nFor n = 8:\nFully Interconnected Network: (8(8-1)(8-2)/4) = 80\nRing Network: 8^2 - 8 = 64\n\nWe can see that the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network is always greater than 1/n. The closest answer choice to this ratio is B. 1/(n(n-1)). Therefore, the answer is B.",
