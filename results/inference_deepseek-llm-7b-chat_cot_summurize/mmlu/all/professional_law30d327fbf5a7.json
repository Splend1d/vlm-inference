At trial, the rider testified that he was attending a horse show when, without provocation, he was kicked by a gray stallion with a black tail. The rider then called the woman as an adverse witness and asked her the following question: \"Isn't it true that you are the owner and trainer of a gray stallion with a black tail?\" After answering affirmatively, the woman was not asked any further questions on direct examination. Whereupon in cross- examination, the woman was then asked, \"Isn't it true that your horse is very gentle and would not kick anyone unless provoked?\"Upon objection by the rider's attorney, the rider's strongest argument would be that the woman's proffered testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible as an improper form of impeachment.\nB. inadmissible as substantive evidence to show that the horse must have been provoked.\nC. inadmissible, because the horse's general propensity cannot be used to prove what occurred on a particular occasion.\nD. inadmissible as beyond the scope of the woman's direct testimony.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Inadmissible, because the horse's general propensity cannot be used to prove what occurred on a particular occasion.\n\nThe woman's attorney asked her if her horse was very gentle and would not kick anyone unless provoked. This question is irrelevant to the issue at hand, which is whether the woman is the owner and trainer of the horse that allegedly kicked the rider. The attorney is trying to introduce new, extraneous information about the horse's general behavior to suggest that the rider must have provoked the horse. This is not allowed under the rules of evidence, as it is not relevant to the specific incident in question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the attorney's question is not an improper form of impeachment. Impeachment refers to the process of challenging the credibility of a witness by attacking their testimony. The attorney's question is not an attempt to attack the woman's credibility, but rather to introduce new information about the horse's behavior.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the attorney's question does introduce new evidence about the horse's behavior, but it does not necessarily prove that the horse was provoked. The attorney is trying to suggest that the rider must have provoked the horse, but the woman's answer does not necessarily prove that the horse was provoked.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the attorney's question is clearly beyond the scope of the woman's direct testimony. The attorney is introducing new information about the horse's behavior, which is not relevant to the woman's ownership or training of the horse.",
