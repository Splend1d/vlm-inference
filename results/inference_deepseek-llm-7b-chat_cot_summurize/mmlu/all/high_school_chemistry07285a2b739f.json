H2O and CH3OH\nB. C6H6 and C5H12\nC. C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH\nD. CH3CH2NH2 and CH3CH2CH2OH\n\nassistant:To determine which pair of liquids is expected to be immiscible, we need to analyze the properties of each liquid.\n\nA. H2O and CH3OH:\nH2O is water, which is miscible with most organic compounds. CH3OH is methanol, which is miscible with water. Therefore, these liquids are miscible and not expected to be immiscible.\n\nB. C6H6 and C5H12:\nC6H6 is benzene, which is miscible with most solvents. C5H12 is cyclohexane, which is miscible with most solvents. Therefore, these liquids are miscible and not expected to be immiscible.\n\nC. C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH:\nC10H22 is octane, which is miscible with most organic compounds. CH2CH2CH2OH is ethanol, which is miscible with most solvents. Therefore, these liquids are miscible and not expected to be immiscible.\n\nD. CH3CH2NH2 and CH3CH2CH2OH:\nCH3CH2NH2 is ethylamine, which is miscible with most organic compounds. CH3CH2CH2OH is ethanol, which is miscible with most solvents. Therefore, these liquids are miscible and not expected to be immiscible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the liquids pair is expected to be immiscible.",
