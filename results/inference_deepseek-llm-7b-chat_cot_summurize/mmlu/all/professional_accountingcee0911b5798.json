Calculate Summer's net operating loss (NOL) from three years ago: $20,000\n2. Determine the amount of Code Sec. 1244 stock loss that was part of the NOL: 3/4 * $20,000 = $15,000\n3. Add the current-year Code Sec. 1244 stock loss to the NOL: $20,000 (NOL) + $50,000 (current-year loss) = $70,000 total loss\n4. Apply the NOL carryover to the current year's income: $80,000 (gross income) - $70,000 (total loss) = $10,000 remaining taxable income\n5. Calculate the amount of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that can be deducted for the current year: $50,000 (current-year loss) - $15,000 (portion of NOL) = $35,000\n\nThe correct answer is B. $35,000 capital loss.",
