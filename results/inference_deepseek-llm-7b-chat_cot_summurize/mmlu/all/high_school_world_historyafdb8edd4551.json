The government dismantled the Chinese-style civil service system.\n\nLord Ii's concerns in his letter to Lord Tokugawa in 1847 highlighted the need for Japan to modernize and adapt to the changing world. Japan responded by dismantling the Chinese-style civil service system and implementing a new system that would better prepare the country for the challenges it faced. This new system, known as the Kokugo-Kokka-Seido, aimed to modernize the government and society, and incorporate Western knowledge and technology into Japan's education and military.\n\nWhile the other options provided do not accurately reflect the response of Japan during this era, they can be considered as potential responses to Lord Ii's concerns. For example, the country could have sent emissaries to study Western democracies and industry, or turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners. However, these options do not directly address Lord Ii's main concern of Japan's antiquated systems and the need for modernization.",
