Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals.\n\nHowever, this option is not the best choice, as it does not accurately reflect Parfit's argument. The most appropriate answer would be:\n\nB. can be compared, but only roughly.\n\nParfit argues that while it is possible to compare the magnitude of pains between individuals, this comparison is only approximate and not precise. He acknowledges that there may be significant differences in the experiences of different individuals, but he still believes that it is possible to make some comparative judgments about the intensity of pain.",
