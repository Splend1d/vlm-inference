This federal statute will most likely be upheld under which of the following constitutional provisions?\n\nA. Thirteenth Amendment.\nB. Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. Fifteenth Amendment.\nD. Twentieth Amendment.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1868, includes the \"equal protection\" and \"due process\" clauses. These clauses were designed to protect the rights of former slaves and others who had been denied their fundamental rights under the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment was also intended to enforce the civil rights provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.\n\nThe text mentions that the congressional report revealed that minorities were disenfranchised, which refers to the right to vote. The federal statute enacted by Congress to address this issue is likely to be upheld under the Fourteenth Amendment because it addresses a fundamental right that is protected under the \"equal protection\" clause, which prohibits states from denying citizens the equal protection of the laws.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Thirteenth Amendment: This amendment abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, but it does not address the right to vote.\n\nC. Fifteenth Amendment: This amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. However, it does not address residency laws or other restrictions on the right to vote.\n\nD. Twentieth Amendment: This amendment deals with the beginning and end of Congress and the President's term, and it is not related to the right to vote.",
