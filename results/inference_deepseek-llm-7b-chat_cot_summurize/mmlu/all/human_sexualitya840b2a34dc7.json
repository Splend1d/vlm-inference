He told his friends this and they encouraged him to get therapy. As part of the treatment he masturbates to his fantasy and at the last moment before orgasm he switches to a fantasy about having sex with a living woman. This procedure is part of the process of:\n\nA. orgasmic reconditioning\nB. aversive conditioning\nC. covert sensitization\nD. desensitization therapy\n\nassistant:The procedure that Shaggy is going through is called desensitization therapy. This is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that is used to help people overcome anxiety or other negative emotional reactions to certain stimuli or situations. In this case, Shaggy is using the technique of switching his fantasy at the last moment to gradually desensitize himself to his initial fantasy, which involves a deceased woman. Over time, he hopes to be able to transition to a fantasy involving a living woman without experiencing the same level of anxiety or negative emotions.",
