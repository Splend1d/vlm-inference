A high degree of government involvement.\nB. Public ownership of resources.\nC. Private property.\nD. Central planners set wages and prices.\n\nassistant:C. Private property.\n\nThe free market system is characterized by private property, which allows individuals and businesses to own and control resources. This promotes economic growth and innovation, as individuals are incentivized to work and invest in their own interests. The other options do not accurately represent the fundamental aspects of the free market system:\n\nA. A high degree of government involvement: Although some government regulation is necessary, the free market system is not characterized by a high degree of government involvement. Instead, it relies on voluntary transactions and market forces to allocate resources efficiently.\n\nB. Public ownership of resources: The free market system does not require public ownership of resources. Private ownership and control of resources is a key component of the free market system, as it allows for competition and innovation.\n\nD. Central planners set wages and prices: The free market system does not rely on central planners to set wages and prices. Instead, the market determines wages and prices through supply and demand.",
