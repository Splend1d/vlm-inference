Once her mother picks her up, the child begins to calm down as which of the following biological processes occurs?\n\nA. The parasympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the sympathetic responses.\nB. The sympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the parasympathetic responses.\nC. The autonomic nervous system resumes control and reverses the peripheral responses.\nD. The peripheral nervous system resumes control and reverses the autonomic responses.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the \"rest and digest\" nervous system, is responsible for calming down the body's responses. When the child starts to calm down after her mother picks her up, it is the parasympathetic nervous system that resumes control and reverses the sympathetic responses.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system, also known as the \"fight or flight\" nervous system, is responsible for the body's \"fight or flight\" response when it detects a threat. However, it does not reverse the parasympathetic responses. The autonomic nervous system is a broader term that includes both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, and it does not resume control and reverse the peripheral responses. The peripheral nervous system is a part of the autonomic nervous system, but it does not control or reverse the autonomic responses.",
