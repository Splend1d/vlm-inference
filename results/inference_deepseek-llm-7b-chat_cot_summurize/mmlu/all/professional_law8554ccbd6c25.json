Thereafter, the salesman sued the company, alleging age discrimination. At trial, he wants to call an employee of the company as an adverse witness. The salesman seeks to have the employee testify that she was present at a company board meeting when the company's president allegedly said, \"Now, I'm sure that everyone agrees that the salesman is too old, and he really doesn't typify the image we want our employees to project. \" It is the common practice of the company to tape record all such board meetings.

Admissible, because the employee was present during the board meeting.\n\nIn this case, the employee would be able to testify that the company's president made the statement in question. This would be relevant to the salesman's claim of age discrimination, as it could provide evidence of the company's motivation for terminating him.\n\nB. Admissible, because the president's statement was an admission by a company representative.\n\nThis would also be a potential ground for admissibility. If the president's statement could be considered an admission by a company representative, it could support the salesman's claim of age discrimination.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.\n\nThis would not be a sufficient ground for inadmissibility. The fact that the tape of the meeting is available does not necessarily mean that it is the best evidence. In fact, it might be difficult to play the tape in court, and the employee's testimony could be more reliable and relevant.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the secretary's transcribed notes are the best evidence.\n\nThis would also not be a sufficient ground for inadmissibility. The fact that the secretary's notes are available does not necessarily mean that they are the best evidence. In fact, the notes could be incomplete or inaccurate. The employee's testimony, on the other hand, could provide a more complete and accurate account of the president's statement.\n\nTherefore, the employee's proposed testimony would likely be admissible under both grounds A and B. However, the court would have to make a final determination on the admissibility of the testimony based on the specific circumstances of the case.",
