The mean weight of books packed per box is 25 pounds, with a standard deviation of two pounds. The mean weight of the boxes is one pound, with a standard deviation of 0.15 pounds. The mean weight of the packing material used per box is two pounds, with a standard deviation of 0.25 pounds. What is the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes?\n\nA. 28.000 pounds\nB. 5.290 pounds\nC. 4.085 pounds\nD. 2.021 pounds\n\nassistant:Let's denote the weight of a book as $w_1$, the weight of a box as $w_2$, and the weight of packing material as $w_3$. We are given that $\\mathbb{E}[w_1] = 25$, $\\mathbb{E}[w_2] = 1$, and $\\mathbb{E}[w_3] = 2$. Also, we have $\\mathbb{E}[w_1w_2] = 6$, $\\mathbb{E}[w_1^2] = 6$, $\\mathbb{E}[w_2^2] = 0.15^2$, and $\\mathbb{E}[w_3^2] = 0.25^2$. We want to find $\\mathbb{E}[w_2^2w_3]$.\n\nWe can use the following identities:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[w_1w_2] &= \\mathbb{E}[w_1]\\mathbb{E}[w_2] = 25\\cdot1 = 25, \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}[w_1^2] &= \\mathbb{E}[w_1^2 - w_1w_2 + w_1w_2] = 6 - 6 + 6 = 6, \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}[w_3^2] &= \\mathbb{E}[w_3^2 - w_1w_3] = 0.25^2 - 2\\cdot2\\cdot0.25 = 0.0625, \\\\\n\\mathbb{E}[w_2^2] &= \\mathbb{E}[w_2^2 - w_1w_2 + w_1^2] = 0.15^2 - 25 + 6 = -7.75.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we want to find $\\mathbb{E}[w_2^2w_3]$. Using the given values, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[w_2^2w_3] &= \\mathbb{E}[w_2^2 - w_1w_2^2 + w_1^2] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[w_2^2 - (25)(0.15^2)] + 6 \\\\\n&= -7.75 - (25)(0.0225) + 6 \\\\\n&= -7.75 - 0.5625 + 6 \\\\\n&= -2.02125.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes is $\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[w_2^2w_3]} \\approx \\sqrt{-2.02125} \\approx 2.828$.
