Scenario 1 | I sold my business to a competitor without my business partner being present. Scenario 2 | I watched the small squirrels from a distance and threw them fireworks.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character sold their business to a competitor without the presence of their business partner. This action is morally wrong because it involves deception and betrayal. The business partner would likely feel betrayed and deceived if they were not present during the sale.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character watched the small squirrels from a distance and threw them fireworks. While this may not be the best thing to do, it is not morally wrong in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It is a harmless action and does not involve deception, betrayal, or any other significant moral violation.",
