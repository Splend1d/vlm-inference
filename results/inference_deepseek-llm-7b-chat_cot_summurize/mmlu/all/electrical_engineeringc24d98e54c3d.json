To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Convert each hexadecimal digit to its binary equivalent.\n2. Concatenate the binary equivalents to form the final binary number.\n\nFor example, the hexadecimal number \"A1\" can be converted to binary as follows:\n\nA (1010) -> 1010 (4 bits)\n1 (0001) -> 0001 (1 bit)\n-------\nTotal bits: 4 + 1 = 2 bits\n\nSo, for each hexadecimal digit, there will be 2 bits when converting to binary.",
