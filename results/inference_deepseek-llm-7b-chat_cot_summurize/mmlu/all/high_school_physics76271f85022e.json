Now, if you put another toy on top of it, the shaking will still happen, but it might not move as far back and forth. This is because the second toy is heavier and it makes the first toy slow down a little. In the case of the horizontal spring-block oscillator, the two blocks sticking together will make the oscillator move back and forth, but the amplitude will be smaller because the second block is heavier. So, the answer is B. It will decrease the amplitude.",
