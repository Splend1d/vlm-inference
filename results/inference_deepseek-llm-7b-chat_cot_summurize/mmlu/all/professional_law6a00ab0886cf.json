He is charged with selling worthless stock in a dummy corporation to unwitting investors. The defendant is alleged to have masterminded a scheme wherein he set up a nonexistent corporation that never conducted business. The victims were sent prospectuses containing false financial data, which induced them to purchase stock in the phony corporation. At trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce into evidence proof that the defendant had set up 10 other so-called dummy corporations that never existed. This evidence is\n\nA. admissible, to show defendant's character trait for dishonesty.\nB. admissible, to show his intent to defraud.\nC. inadmissible, because character cannot be proved by specific instances of misconduct.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is not relevant.\n\nassistant:The evidence of the 10 other so-called dummy corporations that the defendant had set up is admissible for two main reasons:\n\n1. Relevant evidence: The fact that the defendant set up 10 other dummy corporations is relevant to the case. The prosecution can use this evidence to show the defendant's intent and the scope of his fraudulent activities. By setting up these dummy corporations, the defendant demonstrated his intent to defraud unwitting investors.\n\n2. Character evidence: This evidence can be used to show the defendant's character trait for dishonesty. The prosecution can argue that the defendant's actions in setting up these dummy corporations are indicative of his dishonest character. This evidence can be used to support the charge of false pretenses and help convince the jury of the defendant's guilt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A and B.",
