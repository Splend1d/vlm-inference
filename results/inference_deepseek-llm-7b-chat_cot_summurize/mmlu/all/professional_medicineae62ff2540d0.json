Hypothyroidism\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\n\nassistant:The most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea is D. Polycystic ovarian syndrome. The patient's symptoms of emaciation, low BMI, irregular menstrual cycles, and high blood pressure, as well as her history of gymnastics, which may contribute to anorexia nervosa, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's low BMI and high blood pressure may indicate a relative adrenal insufficiency, which could be a potential complication of polycystic ovarian syndrome.",
