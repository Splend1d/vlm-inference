I.Increasing the sample size. II.Increasing the significance level. III.Increasing the probability of a Type II error.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. I and II\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. I and II.\n\nWhen all other variables remain constant, increasing the sample size and the significance level will both increase the power of a hypothesis test. The power of a hypothesis test is the probability that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. The sample size and the significance level both affect the power of the test.\n\nIncreasing the sample size increases the power of the test because it increases the variance of the sampling distribution of the test statistic. The significance level, also known as the level of significance, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A higher significance level increases the probability of committing a Type I error, or rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. However, it also increases the power of the test.\n\nIncreasing the probability of a Type II error, or not rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true, does not increase the power of the test. The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis, not the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis.",
