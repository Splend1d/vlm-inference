An international wrongful conduct is every breach of an international obligation of the State, whether attributable to it or not\nC. An internationally wrongful conduct consists of an action or omission attributable to the State, which constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State\nD. An internationally wrongful conduct is the conduct that cannot be excused on grounds of necessity, force majeure etc.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. An international wrongful conduct is an action or omission which is in breach of a rule of international criminal law.\n\nAn internationally wrongful conduct is a violation of international law, specifically international criminal law. This can include actions such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. These acts are considered to be internationally wrongful because they are considered to be a breach of the rules and norms of international law, and can result in legal consequences for the perpetrator.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it is a general definition of international wrongful conduct and does not specifically mention international criminal law.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it only applies to conduct that is attributable to the state, while international wrongful conduct can also include individual actions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is a definition of conduct that cannot be excused, but does not specifically mention international wrongful conduct.",
