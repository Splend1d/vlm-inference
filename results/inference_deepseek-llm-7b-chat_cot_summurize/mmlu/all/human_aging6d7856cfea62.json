To elaborate, the full retirement age for Social Security benefits is 66 years and 4 months for people born in 1943 or later. This means that individuals born after 1943 must wait until their full retirement age to receive their full Social Security benefits. If a person chooses to retire before their full retirement age, their benefits will be reduced.",
