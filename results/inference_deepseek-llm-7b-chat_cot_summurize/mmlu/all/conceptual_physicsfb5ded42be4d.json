An alpha particle is a helium-4 nucleus, which consists of two protons and two neutrons.\n\n2. When an element ejects an alpha particle, it loses two protons and two neutrons.\n\n3. In order to understand the mass number change, we need to compare the initial and final mass numbers.\n\nInitial element: Z1*A1 = 2*A1\nFinal element: Z2*A2 = 0*A2 (no protons) + 4*A2 (two neutrons)\n\n4. The difference between the initial and final mass numbers gives us the number of alpha particles emitted.\n\nDifference = A1 - A2 = A1 - 2A1 = 2A1\n\n5. The question asks about the mass number reduction, so we must find the reduction in the initial mass number.\n\nReduction = (2A1) / A1 = 2\n\n6. The answer is A.",
