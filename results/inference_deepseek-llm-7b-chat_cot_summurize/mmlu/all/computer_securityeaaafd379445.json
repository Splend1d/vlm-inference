No, an attacker can simply guess the tag for messages.\n\nIn a 5-bit MAC, there are 2^5 = 32 possible tags. If an attacker can generate any of these tags, they can simply guess the tag for any message they are interested in. This means that the MAC is not secure, as it does not provide sufficient randomness or security to protect the message.",
