It does not load the circuit at all.\n\nassistant:Potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it uses a centre zero galvanometer instead of a voltmeter. The galvanometer is a direct current (DC) current meter that has a very low resistance, which allows it to measure the current with high accuracy. In contrast, a voltmeter measures AC voltage, which can introduce errors into the measurement. Additionally, the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement uses a low-value resistor in series with the circuit, which allows for a more accurate reading of the voltage.",
