What is the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk, if it is assumed that computation is not overlapped with file access?\n\nA. 1/1\nB. 5/4\nC. 5/3\nD. 10/5\n\nassistant:Let's calculate the total time required for the compilation on both workstations.\n\nOn the diskless (file server) workstation, the total time required for the compilation is:\n\nTime = computation time + file access time\nTime = 30 seconds + (200 accesses * (0.1 second per access))\nTime = 30 seconds + 20 seconds\nTime = 50 seconds\n\nOn the workstation with the local disk, the total time required for the compilation is:\n\nTime = computation time + file access time\nTime = 30 seconds + (200 accesses * (0.05 second per access))\nTime = 30 seconds + 10 seconds\nTime = 40 seconds\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of the total time required by this compilation on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk.\n\nRatio = (diskless workstation time) / (local disk workstation time)\nRatio = 50 seconds / 40 seconds\nRatio = 5/4\n\nSo the correct answer is B. 5/4.",
