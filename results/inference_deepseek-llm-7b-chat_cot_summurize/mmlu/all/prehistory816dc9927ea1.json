This belief is also known as catastrophism, which is the idea that the Earth's surface has been significantly changed by catastrophic events such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. This perspective is often contrasted with uniformitarianism, which is the idea that the Earth's surface has changed gradually over time through natural processes.\n\nA paleoanthropologist is a scientist who studies the history of human evolution, while a natural scientist is a broad term that can include many different types of scientists who study the natural world. An evolutionist is a person who believes that the diversity of life on Earth has arisen through evolutionary processes, which can include both natural selection and genetic drift.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. catastrophist.",
