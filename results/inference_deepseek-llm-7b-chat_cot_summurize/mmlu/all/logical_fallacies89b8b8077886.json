This means that the person will be mad as a result of not doing well on the test.\n\nOption B, \"I won't take the test,\" is not a valid conclusion because it introduces a new condition (not taking the test) that is not mentioned in the major premise.\n\nOption C, \"My birthday is today,\" is irrelevant to the major premise and does not lead to a valid conclusion.\n\nOption D, \"both A and B,\" is also not a valid conclusion because it combines two separate conditions (not doing well on the test and not taking the test) that are not mentioned in the major premise.",
