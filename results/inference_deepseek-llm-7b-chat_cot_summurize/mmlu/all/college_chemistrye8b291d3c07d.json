Both 35Cl and 37Cl have I = 0.\nB. The hydrogen atom undergoes rapid intermolecular exchange.\nC. The molecule is not rigid.\nD. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have I = 0.\n\nThe 1H spectrum of 12CHCl3 is a singlet because both 35Cl and 37Cl have an electron configuration that allows them to have an I = 0 spin-orbit coupling. This means that the electrons in the valence orbitals of these chlorine atoms are in a state where they are not in a spin-orbit coupling interaction with the nucleus, and therefore, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal from the hydrogen atoms in the molecule is a singlet.\n\nB. The hydrogen atom undergoes rapid intermolecular exchange is not correct because the NMR spectrum of a molecule depends on the local environment of the nuclei and not on their motion.\n\nC. The molecule is not rigid is not relevant to the NMR spectrum of a molecule. The NMR spectrum of a molecule depends on the local environment of the nuclei and not on the molecule's flexibility.\n\nD. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments is not correct because the quadrupole coupling is a small effect at low magnetic fields and it is not the reason for the singlet character of the 1H spectrum.",
