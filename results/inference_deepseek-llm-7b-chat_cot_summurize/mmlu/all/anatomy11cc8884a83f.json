Carbon dioxide\nB. Carbon monoxide\nC. Nitrogen\nD. Oxygen\n\nassistant:All of the substances listed (A, B, C, and D) are found in varying quantities in exhaled air. Exhaled air primarily consists of nitrogen (about 78% of the volume), oxygen (about 21%), and trace amounts of other gases and compounds. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is also present in exhaled air, although in a much lower concentration than oxygen. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas that can be harmful if inhaled in high concentrations, and it is not found in exhaled air in significant amounts. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D. Oxygen.",
