What is the probability of committing a Type I error and incorrectly rejecting a true H0 with at least one of the 10 tests?\n\nA. 0.05\nB. 0.40\nC. 0.50\nD. 0.60\n\nassistant:To find the probability of committing a Type I error and incorrectly rejecting a true H0 with at least one of the 10 tests, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(at least 1 rejection) = 1 - P(no rejections)\n\nThe probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis in a single test is:\n\nP(not rejecting H0) = 1 - P(rejection of H0) = 1 - P(\u03bc > 25)\n\nSince we are testing against a null hypothesis of \u03bc = 25, the probability of a rejection is:\n\nP(rejection of H0) = P(\u03bc < 25) = P(\u03bc < 25 | H0) * P(H0)\n\nWe know that the probability of observing a sample mean of 25 or greater in a population with a true mean of 25 is:\n\nP(\u03bc < 25) = 0.5\n\nWe also know that the probability of observing a sample mean of 25 or greater in a population with a true mean of 50 is:\n\nP(\u03bc < 25 | H0) = 1 - P(\u03bc > 25 | H0) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis in a single test is 0.5.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis in all 10 tests:\n\nP(not rejecting H0) = (0.5)^10 = 0.010464\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability of committing a Type I error and incorrectly rejecting a true H0 with at least one of the 10 tests:\n\nP(at least 1 rejection) = 1 - P(no rejections) = 1 - 0.010464 = 0.989536\n\nThis is closest to option D. 0.60.",
