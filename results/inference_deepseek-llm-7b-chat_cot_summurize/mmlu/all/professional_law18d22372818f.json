The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes.

The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes.\n\nThe federal district court will most likely uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause. The establishment clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from establishing a national religion or favoring one religion over another. The statute at issue does not establish a national religion or favor one religion over another. It merely authorizes the payment of state funds to private institutions of higher learning that meet certain criteria and refrain from awarding only seminarian or theological degrees. The added provision that the grants may not be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes further ensures that the statute does not violate the establishment clause.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Dismiss the action for lack of standing: The plaintiffs, eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, have standing to bring the suit as they have a direct and immediate interest in the outcome of the case.\n\nC. Invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause: As explained above, the statute does not establish a national religion or favor one religion over another, and the added provision that grants may not be utilized for sectarian purposes further ensures that the statute does not violate the establishment clause.\n\nD. Uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education: While the statute may be seen as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education, it may also be seen as potentially violative of the establishment clause. Therefore, the federal district court would likely uphold the statute's validity as nonviolative of the establishment clause.",
