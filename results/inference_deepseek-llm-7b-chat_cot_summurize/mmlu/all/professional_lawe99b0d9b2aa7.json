In determining what rights the employee has against the employer, the agreement between the employer and the employee may best be interpreted as\n\nA. an entire contract.\nB. a divisible contract.\nC. an installment contract.\nD. neither divisible nor entire.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. an entire contract.\n\nAn entire agreement means that the agreement between the employer and the employee covers all the terms and conditions of the employment relationship, including the duration of the employment, the weekly salary, and any rights and obligations of the parties.\n\nA divisible contract would mean that the agreement could be divided into different parts or sections, which is not the case here. An installment contract would mean that the agreement is structured as a series of payments over time, which is not the case here either.\n\nTherefore, the best interpretation of the agreement between the employer and the employee is that it is an entire contract, which covers all the terms and conditions of the employment relationship.",
