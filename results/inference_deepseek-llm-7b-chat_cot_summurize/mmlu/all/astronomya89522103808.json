Chicxulub Crater Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.\n\nThe Chicxulub impact crater is believed to be the site of the mass extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago. The crater is located on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and is approximately 180 kilometers (110 miles) in diameter. The impact that caused this crater was likely caused by a large extraterrestrial object, such as a comet or asteroid, which struck the Earth at a relatively shallow angle, causing widespread destruction and triggering a global mass extinction event.",
