Variable sampling.\nB. Discovery sampling.\nC. Attribute sampling.\nD. Random-number sampling.\n\nassistant:To estimate a numerical measurement of a population such as the dollar value of inventory, an auditor would use variable sampling. This method involves selecting individual units from the population based on some attribute or characteristic, such as the dollar value of each item. By selecting units with different dollar values, the auditor can estimate the population mean with a higher degree of accuracy.\n\nRandom-number sampling is another sampling method that auditors may use, but it is not the best method for estimating the dollar value of inventory. With random-number sampling, the auditor randomly selects units from the population until a predetermined sample size is reached. This method can be useful for estimating population parameters like the population mean, but it may not accurately estimate the dollar value of inventory because it does not take into account any specific characteristics of the units being sampled.\n\nDiscovery sampling and attribute sampling are not appropriate methods for estimating the dollar value of inventory. Discovery sampling involves selecting units based on their discovery in the population, which may not be the most representative sample. Attribute sampling involves selecting units based on some attribute or characteristic, but it is not specific enough to accurately estimate the dollar value of inventory.\n\nTherefore, the best method for estimating the dollar value of inventory is variable sampling.",
