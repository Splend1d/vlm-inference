The blastomere with the gray crescent will stop dividing and die before the second cleavage.\n\nassistant:The answer is B. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\n\nIn this experiment, the first cleavage plane of an amphibian zygote was manipulated so that the gray crescent was contained in only one of the two blastomeres that result from the first cleavage. This means that one of the blastomeres has the gray crescent, while the other does not.\n\nWhen the two blastomeres are separated, the one with the gray crescent will have a growth advantage over the other. This is because the gray crescent contains a growth factor that promotes cell division and growth. As a result, the blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo, while the other blastomere will not form an embryo at all.",
