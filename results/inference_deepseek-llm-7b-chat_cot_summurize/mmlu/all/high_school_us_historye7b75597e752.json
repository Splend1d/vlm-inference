How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world?

Manifest Destiny\n\nassistant:Albert J. Beveridge's sentiment expressed in his speech \"The March of the Flag\" in 1898 best exemplifies Imperialism. The passage highlights the justification of American rule over territories and indigenous peoples, arguing that the rule of liberty only applies to those who can self-govern. The speech also emphasizes the duty of the United States to maintain control and protect these territories from other imperialistic nations like Germany, England, and Japan.",
