A dispute has arisen between the parties and Roberta is trying to prove that Wendy is a \u0089\u00db\u00cfmerchant\u0089\u00db\u009d as opposed to a \"casual party.\" The least important factor indicating the status of a \"merchant\" is that Wendy\n\nA. Is a wholesaler rather than a retailer.\nB. Deals in the goods sold to Roberta.\nC. Holds herself out as an expert in the goods sold to Roberta.\nD. Sells under 10 units a year to Roberta.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Understand the context: The user is trying to determine the least important factor that indicates the status of a \"merchant\" in the context of a dispute between Wendy Wholesaler and Roberta Retailer.\n\n2. Identify relevant information: The question provides the following information:\n  - Wendy is a wholesaler.\n  - Roberta is trying to prove that Wendy is a \"merchant\" (as opposed to a \"casual party\").\n\n3. Analyze the options:\n  A. Is a wholesaler rather than a retailer.\n  B. Deals in the goods sold to Roberta.\n  C. Holds herself out as an expert in the goods sold to Roberta.\n  D. Sells under 10 units a year to Roberta.\n\n4. Evaluate the importance of each factor:\n  A. Wholesaler status vs. retailer status is relevant to the status of a \"merchant.\"\n  B. Dealing in goods sold to Roberta is relevant to the goods being sold, but does not necessarily indicate the status of a \"merchant.\"\n  C. Holding oneself out as an expert in goods sold to Roberta may indicate expertise in the field, but does not necessarily indicate a \"merchant\" status.\n  D. Selling under 10 units a year to Roberta is a specific criterion for a \"casual party,\" but does not necessarily indicate the status of a \"merchant.\"\n\n5. Determine the least important factor: Based on the evaluation, option A is the least important factor indicating the status of a \"merchant\" in the context of this dispute. This is because the user's status as a wholesaler does not necessarily imply that they are a \"merchant\" as opposed to a \"casual party.\"\n\nSo, the answer is A. Is a wholesaler rather than a retailer.",
