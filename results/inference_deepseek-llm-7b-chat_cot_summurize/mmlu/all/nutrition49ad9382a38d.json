Pregnant and lactating women\nB. Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea\nC. All children in low income areas with high prevalence of stunting\nD. Elderly people with low incomes\n\nassistant:Zinc supplements are recommended for groups of people who are at risk of zinc deficiency, which can lead to malnutrition, immune system weakness, and other health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified several groups of people who may benefit from zinc supplementation, including:\n\n* Pregnant and lactating women: These groups of people have increased nutritional needs due to the demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding. Zinc is essential for the healthy development of the fetus and infant, and supplementation can help ensure that these individuals receive enough zinc to meet their needs.\n* Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea: These conditions can lead to zinc deficiency and can cause serious health problems, such as impaired growth and immune system weakness. Zinc supplementation can help restore normal zinc levels and support the recovery of these children.\n* All children in low income areas with high prevalence of stunting: Stunting is a sign of chronic malnutrition and can also be linked to zinc deficiency. Zinc supplementation can help improve growth and development in these children.\n\nWhile zinc supplementation is not recommended for elderly people with low incomes, it is important for them to maintain a healthy diet and consult with healthcare providers to ensure that they receive enough zinc to meet their needs.",
