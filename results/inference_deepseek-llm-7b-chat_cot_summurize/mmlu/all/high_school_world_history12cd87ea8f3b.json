Morality and justice\n\nassistant:The author of this text expresses a belief in morality and justice as requirements for a properly functioning legal system. In the text, Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar talks about the need for a legal system that is based on proper morals and not force. He also mentions that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants because laws are more inflexible and every one should submit to their beneficent austerity. This suggests that he believes that a legal system should be based on justice and virtue. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Morality and justice.",
