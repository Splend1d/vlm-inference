It is not arguing that an action should be taken based on feeling sorry for someone, nor is it arguing that an action should be taken based on the need to be loyal to someone. It also does not involve accepting an idea based solely on who originated the idea. Instead, it involves using the emotional connection between the speaker and the listener to persuade the listener to change their opinion or behavior.",
