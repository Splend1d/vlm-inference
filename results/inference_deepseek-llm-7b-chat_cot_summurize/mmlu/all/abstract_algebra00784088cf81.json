False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G then |aH| = |Ha|.\n\nThis statement is true. The order of a subgroup H in a group G is defined as the set of elements of G that commute with every element in H. Since a belongs to G, it commutes with every element in H, so the order of a subgroup aH in G is the same as the order of the subgroup Ha in G.\n\nStatement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.\n\nThis statement is also true. If aH and Hb are identical or disjoint, then either aH = Hb or aH \u2229 Hb = \u2205. If aH = Hb, then every element in aH is in Hb and every element in Hb is in aH, which means that a and b commute with every element in H, and so they belong to G. If aH \u2229 Hb = \u2205, then there are no elements in common between aH and Hb, which means that a and b do not commute with every element in H. In either case, aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.",
