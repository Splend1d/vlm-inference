She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?\n\nA. north\nB. east\nC. south\nD. west\n\nassistant:To determine the direction the skater faces after spinning, we can use the concept of \"cardinal directions\" and \"compass directions.\"\n\n1. Start by identifying the initial direction the skater is facing, which is north.\n2. The skater spins 2250 degrees to her right, which means she rotates 2250 degrees clockwise.\n3. To determine the equivalent counterclockwise rotation, we can add 360 degrees to 2250 degrees.\n4. 2250 + 360 = 2610 degrees.\n5. Now, we can divide this by 90 degrees to find the number of rotations.\n6. 2610 / 90 = 29 rotations.\n7. Since each rotation is equal to 90 degrees, the total rotation after 29 rotations is 29 * 90 = 2610 degrees.\n8. Since the skater is spinning clockwise, the equivalent direction she will face is the one that is opposite to the initial direction. In this case, that would be west.\n\nSo the answer is D. west.",
