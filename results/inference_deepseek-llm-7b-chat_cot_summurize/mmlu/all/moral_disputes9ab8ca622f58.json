He has stated that he believes waterboarding, which involves placing a person on their stomach and pouring water over their nose and mouth until they experience the sensation of drowning, is a form of torture that he believes is permissible in some cases. However, it is important to note that Dershowitz's views on torture are controversial and have been widely criticized by many people.\n\nIn this case, option C, \"submerging the victim in water so he or she feels as if he or she is drowning,\" is the correct answer. Dershowitz has argued that waterboarding can be justified as a means of obtaining information from terrorists and potential threats to national security. However, it is important to note that this method of torture is highly controversial and has been condemned by many human rights organizations.",
