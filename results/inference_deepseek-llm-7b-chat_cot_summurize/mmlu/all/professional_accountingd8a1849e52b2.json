The inflation rate is expected to fall from 5% per year to 3% per year. As a result of the change in the inflation premium, the company's\n\nA. Stock price will likely decrease.\nB. Cost of equity will likely remain stable.\nC. Cost of equity will likely decrease.\nD. Stock price will likely remain stable.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Stock price will likely remain stable.\n\nThe inflation rate is expected to fall from 5% per year to 3% per year, which means the inflation premium will decrease. This means that the company's dividends will be worth more, as they are adjusted for inflation. The analyst also expects a dividend growth rate of 3%. This means that the company will be paying out more dividends in the future.\n\nSince both the inflation premium and the dividend growth rate are positive, they will increase the value of the company's future cash flows. This will increase the company's stock price, making it likely that the stock price will remain stable or even increase.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because the decrease in the inflation premium and the increase in the dividend growth rate will increase the value of the company's future cash flows, which will lead to an increase in the company's stock price.",
