Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I am not able to access the two scenarios you mentioned, but I can help you understand the process of evaluating morality. Ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would consider the actions of the main character in each scenario based on widely accepted norms and principles.\n\nScenario 1: Jeering at a homeless shelter\nIn this scenario, the main character jeers at a homeless shelter. Jeering generally refers to making insulting or mocking comments, which can be considered disrespectful and unkind. Homeless shelters provide essential services and support to individuals in need, and treating them with disrespect can be seen as a violation of basic human dignity.\n\nScenario 2: Not voting for the president due to personal benefit\nIn this scenario, the main character chooses not to vote for the president because they believe the president wants the office for their own personal gain. While this might not be seen as an inherently immoral act, it could be argued that not participating in the democratic process by voting could have broader implications for society. The decision not to vote may be based on the belief that the candidate is unfit for office, but it could also be interpreted as a form of apathy or indifference towards the political system.\n\nBased on these explanations, the answer to your question would be:\n\nA.
