The distinction between killing and letting die is based on the idea that there is a difference between intentionally ending someone's life and not taking action to prevent their death.\n\nIn the options you provided, each one represents a different way in which a person's life could be at risk. For example, A) sending poisoned food would be an intentional act of harm, while B) refusing to give money could be seen as a failure to act. C) withholding medicine would be a deliberate act to prevent someone from receiving life-saving treatment, and D) depriving them of knowledge could potentially lead to death if they are unable to acquire food or other necessary resources.\n\nIt is important to note that the moral weight of each of these actions would depend on a variety of factors, such as the context in which they occur, the intentions of the individuals involved, and the potential consequences of each action.\n\nUltimately, the distinction between killing and letting die is a complex and nuanced concept that requires careful consideration of all the factors involved. It is not necessarily a question of who is \"to blame\" for allowing people to starve, but rather a question of how we can best protect and promote human life in a world where resources are often scarce.",
