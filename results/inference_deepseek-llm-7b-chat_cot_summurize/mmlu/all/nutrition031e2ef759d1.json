All of the above\n\nassistant:All of the above.\n\nReduced secretion of intrinsic factor, atrophic gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori infection are all factors that contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults. Intrinsic factor is a protein produced by the stomach that helps the body absorb vitamin B12 from food. Atrophic gastritis is a condition in which the stomach lining thins and becomes damaged, making it difficult for the body to absorb vitamin B12. Helicobacter pylori is a bacteria that can cause inflammation and damage to the stomach lining, which can also lead to a deficiency in vitamin B12.",
