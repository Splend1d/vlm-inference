This regulation may be seen as a legitimate state interest, as it is designed to promote public safety and order on the state's roadways.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the state statute would be held constitutional as applied to the resident, as it is protecting a legitimate state interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest.",
