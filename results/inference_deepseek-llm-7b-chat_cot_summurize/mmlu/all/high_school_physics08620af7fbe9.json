The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The sphere reaches the bottom of the ramp first because it gains rotational kinetic energy while rolling down the inclined plane. The block slides down the plane without friction, but it does not gain rotational kinetic energy because it does not rotate.",
