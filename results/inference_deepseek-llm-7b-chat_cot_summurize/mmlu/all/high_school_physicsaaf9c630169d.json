The student who drops it measures the frequency with a very sensitive oscilloscope. The measured frequency\n\nA. appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency increase as it falls\nB. appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls\nC. appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls\nD. appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency increases as it falls\n\nassistant:The answer is A. appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency increase as it falls.\n\nWhen an object falls under the influence of gravity, it experiences a force that accelerates it downward. This acceleration is proportional to the mass of the object and the acceleration due to gravity (g), and inversely proportional to the square of the object's inertia (inertia being the resistance of an object to changes in its velocity).\n\nFor an object falling under the influence of gravity, the frequency of its oscillations will increase as it falls. This is because the acceleration due to gravity acts as a force that increases the amplitude of the oscillations.\n\nIn the context of the question, when the alarm is dropped out of the third-floor window, it will experience the force of gravity acting on it. This force will cause the oscillations of the alarm to increase in amplitude, resulting in a higher frequency than the initial 400 Hz.",
