In general, an expansionary supply shock occurs when the supply of goods and services in an economy increases, leading to a decrease in prices and an increase in output.\n\nThe short-run Phillips curve and short-run unemployment rate are both influenced by changes in the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. An expansionary supply shock can shift the SRAS curve to the right, indicating that firms are producing more with the same level of inputs. This can lead to a lower short-run equilibrium level of employment and a lower short-run unemployment rate.\n\nThe long-run unemployment rate, on the other hand, is determined by the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve, which represents the relationship between the level of output and the price level. An expansionary supply shock can shift the LRAS curve to the right, indicating that firms are producing more with the same level of inputs. This can lead to a higher long-run equilibrium level of employment, but it can also lead to a higher long-run unemployment rate if the increase in output is not sufficient to accommodate the increase in the labor force.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Shifts up, rises, and rises. The short-run Phillips curve shifts up, leading to a lower short-run unemployment rate. The short-run unemployment rate rises. The long-run unemployment rate rises due to the shift in the LRAS curve.",
