This situation was a direct result of the lack of a strong and effective national government, which allowed states to interpret and enforce laws in ways that perpetuated racial inequality.\n\nIn Federalist #15, Alexander Hamilton proposed a solution to address this issue by advocating for a stronger national government that could enforce laws and protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of race or ethnicity. This would involve increasing spending on military forces to ensure the nation's security and protect its citizens, as well as cutting spending on social programs that were seen as unnecessary or ineffective.\n\nWhile this may seem like a contradictory approach at first glance, it can be understood in the context of the time. The United States was in the process of rebuilding itself after the Civil War, and many people believed that increased spending on defense was necessary to protect the nation's interests and prevent future conflicts. At the same time, there were concerns about the effectiveness of social programs and the potential for waste and fraud in their implementation.\n\nBy proposing to increase spending on military forces and cut spending on social programs, Hamilton was attempting to balance the need for national security with the need for economic efficiency and social justice. This approach was intended to create a stronger and more unified national government that could address the problems identified in Federalist #15 and protect the rights of all citizens, including African Americans.",
