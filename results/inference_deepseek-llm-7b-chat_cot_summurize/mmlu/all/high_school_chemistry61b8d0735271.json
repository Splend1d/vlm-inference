You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: If 1.0 g of rubidium and 1.0 g of bromine are reacted, what will be left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg) in the reaction vessel?\n\nA. RbBr only\nB. RbBr and Rb only\nC. RbBr and Br2 only\nD. RbBr, Rb, and Br2\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. RbBr, Rb, and Br2.\n\nRubidium bromide (RbBr) is formed as a product of the reaction between rubidium and bromine. Rubidium and bromine react to form a white solid, rubidium bromide. Rubidium bromide is insoluble in water, but it can be dissolved in organic solvents such as benzene, ethanol, and ether. Rubidium bromide is used as a reagent in the chemical industry, and it is also used as an analytical reagent in the determination of rubidium in a sample.\n\nRubidium is a soft, silvery-white alkaline metal that reacts violently with water and other moist substances. It is a heavy metal and has a low density. Rubidium is used in some atomic clocks because it has a relatively short period of electron transition between two energy levels, which makes it a good clock element. Rubidium is also used in some research and medical applications.\n\nBromine is a chemical element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. It is a halogen and is a nonmetal. Bromine is a corrosive, toxic, and flammable liquid with a faint, unpleasant odor. It is a colorless, yellow-colored gas at room temperature. Bromine is used in the production of pesticides, dyes, and photographic chemicals. It is also used in the production of some flame-retardant materials. Bromine is also used in the purification of other metals, such as copper and gold.\n\nThe reaction between rubidium and bromine is an example of an exothermic reaction, which means that heat is released during the reaction. The reaction can be represented by the following equation:\n\nRb + Br2 \u2192 RbBr + 1/2 \u2206H\n\nwhere \u2206H is the enthalpy change of the reaction. The enthalpy change of the reaction is positive, which means that the reaction releases heat. The products of the reaction are rubidium bromide and bromine gas. Rubidium bromide is insoluble in water, but it can be dissolved in organic solvents such as benzene, ethanol, and ether. Rubidium bromide is used as a reagent in the chemical industry, and it is also used as an analytical reagent in the determination of rubidium in a sample.

Rubidium is also used in some research and medical applications.\n\nIn summary, rubidium bromide is formed as a product of the reaction between rubidium and bromine. Rubidium and bromine react to form a white solid, rubidium bromide. Rubidium and bromine are left in measurable amounts in the reaction vessel, along with rubidium bromide.",
