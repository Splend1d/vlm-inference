None of these. In the 8085, there are no 16-bit registers. The 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor, which means it can only process 8 bits of data at a time. Therefore, it does not have 16-bit registers. The 8085 has eight 8-bit general purpose registers (A to H), two 16-bit accumulator registers (A and B), and one 8-bit index register (I).",
