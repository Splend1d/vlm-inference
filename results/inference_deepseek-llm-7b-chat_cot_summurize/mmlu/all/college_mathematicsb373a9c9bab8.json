As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\n\nA. 12*sqrt(2)\nB. 6*sqrt(2)\nC. 4*sqrt(2)\nD. 1/(2*sqrt(2))\n\nassistant:Let x be the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground, and y be the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the ground.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following relationships:\n\n1. y = 9 - x, since the ladder is 9 meters long and it is leaning against the wall.\n2. dx/dt = 2 m/s, since the bottom end of the ladder is moving away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second.\n\nWe want to find dy/dt when y = 3 m.\n\nFirst, we differentiate the first equation with respect to time t:\n\ndy/dt = dx/dt = 2 m/s\n\nNow we can use the chain rule to differentiate the second equation:\n\nd/dt(9 - x) = 2\n\n9 - x = 2t\nx = 2t - 7\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x back into the dy/dt equation:\n\ndy/dt = 2\n\nNow we can solve for t when y = 3 m:\n\n3 = 9 - x\nx = 6\n\nSo, when the top end of the ladder is 3 meters above the ground:\n\nx = 6\ny = 9 - x = 3\n\nNow we can find the time:\n\n6 = 2t - 7\n2t = 13\nt = 13/2 = 6.5\n\nNow we can find the velocity of the top end of the ladder:\n\ndy/dt = 2\n\nSo the top end of the ladder is sliding downward at a rate of 2 meters per second.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 12*sqrt(2)",
