This would suggest that the Soviet regime was able to successfully implement and carry out the ideals of the Russian Revolution, leading to positive outcomes such as increased literacy rates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Lenin and Stalin vastly improved Russian military preparedness.",
