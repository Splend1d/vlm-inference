As a result, the conservationist or their successors in interest (in this case, the daughters) have the right to re-enter the property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the daughters' right to the property did not vest immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex. They would need to exercise their right of re-entry first.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the possibility of reverter (the return of the property to the grantor or their heirs if the grantee fails to meet certain conditions) does not provide a direct remedy for the daughters in this situation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the developer's construction of the hotel complex does not establish a common development scheme for the entire tract. The restriction in the conservationist's deed only applies to commercial use, not to the overall development of the property.",
