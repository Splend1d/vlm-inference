It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.\n\nassistant:The margin of error in a poll refers to the range of results that could be expected if the same poll was conducted multiple times with the same sample size. In this case, a margin of error of 3% means that if the poll were repeated, the true percentage of people who use grocery coupons could be expected to fall within the range of 79% to 85%.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best description of what is meant by the poll having a margin of error of 3%.\n\nA margin of error of 3% means that the true percentage of people who use grocery coupons could be expected to fall within the range of 79% to 85%. So if the poll were repeated, we would expect the true percentage to be between 79% and 85% of the population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.",
