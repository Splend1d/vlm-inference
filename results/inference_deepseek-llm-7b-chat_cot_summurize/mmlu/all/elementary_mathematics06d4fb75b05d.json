What was the total number of milkshakes that the ice cream shop sold that day?\n\nA. 60\nB. 72\nC. 100\nD. 120\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can set up the following equation:\n\n40% of the total number of milkshakes sold = 48\n\nLet x be the total number of milkshakes sold. Then, we have:\n\n0.4x = 48\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 48 / 0.4\nx = 120\n\nThe ice cream shop sold a total of 120 milkshakes that day. The correct answer is D. 120.",
