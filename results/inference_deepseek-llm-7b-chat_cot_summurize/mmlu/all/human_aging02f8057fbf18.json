TAT\nB. MMPI\nC. Rorschach ink blot test\nD. McAdams test of levels\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Rorschach ink blot test.\n\nThe Rorschach ink blot test is a psychological assessment method in which the subject is presented with a series of inkblot cards and asked to describe what they see. The test is considered an objective test of personality because the responses to the inkblots are scored and analyzed based on objective criteria, such as consistency, content, and imagery. The other options are not objective tests of personality:\n\nA. TAT (Thematic Apperception Test) is a projective test in which the subject is presented with a series of ambiguous pictures and asked to create a story to explain the situation depicted in the picture. The interpretation of the TAT is subjective and depends on the tester's biases and assumptions.\n\nB. MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) is a self-report psychological test that measures a range of psychological variables, including neuroticism, psychoticism, and agreeableness. It is not a test of personality per se, but rather a measure of psychological functioning.\n\nD. McAdams test of levels is not a recognized test of personality.",
