The statement suggests that myth is a way of understanding the world and defining reason, and that it is interconnected with reason. Mythos refers to the stories and beliefs that are passed down through generations, while logos refers to logical thinking and reasoning. The statement implies that both myth and reason are fundamental to understanding the world and defining what it means to be rational.",
