Yes, there were sufficient facts for the former employee to establish the basic elements of the malicious prosecution tort.\n\nThe former employee may be able to allege facts sufficient to support a malicious prosecution case. The officer arrested the former employee based on the information provided by the business owner, which seemed to be enough to establish the elements of the criminal charges. However, the criminal case was thrown out due to lack of evidence, and the former employee may be able to argue that the officer's actions were malicious and caused him undue harm. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The officer did not receive enough facts to establish the elements of the criminal charges.\nC. The business owner's knowledge of the former employee's actions does not necessarily mean that the officer's actions were malicious.\nD. The officer's arrest and filing of criminal charges may have been improper, but that does not necessarily mean that malicious prosecution occurred.",
