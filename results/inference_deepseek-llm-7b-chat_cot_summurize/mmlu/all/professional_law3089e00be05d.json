He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n",

The uncle knew that the teenager was incapable of driving a car safely. The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic.

No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nIn this scenario, the uncle knew that the teenager was an incompetent operator with a history of reckless driving, and still allowed him to drive the car. This constitutes negligent entrustment, which is a recognized tort in many jurisdictions. The trial court's decision to grant the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim would likely be overturned on appeal, as there is a recognized tort of first-party negligent entrustment.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because public policy does not generally forbid the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nAnswer B is incorrect because comparative negligence does not always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nAnswer C is incorrect because public policy does not demand that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.",
