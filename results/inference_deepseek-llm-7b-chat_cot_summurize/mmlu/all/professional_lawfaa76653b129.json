At trial, the defendant attempts to show that prior to the killing, he was told by a drinking buddy that \"The victim has killed five men and would as soon kill a man as look at him. \"If the statement by the drinking buddy is offered into evidence to prove that the victim, in fact, killed the five men, the statement should be ruled\n\nA. admissible, because the statement is offered to demonstrate its effect on the defendant.\nB. admissible, because it qualifies under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is self-serving.\n\nassistant:The statement made by the drinking buddy to the defendant should be considered inadmissible. This is because it falls under the category of hearsay, which is a statement made by a witness that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay statements are not admissible as evidence in court, as they are not based on the witness's personal knowledge, but rather on the information received from another source.\n\nIn this case, the statement made by the drinking buddy is offered to prove that the victim did indeed kill the five men. However, since the statement was made to the defendant, it does not qualify under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. This exception allows for the admission of statements made by a defendant, a party, a witness, or other person for the truth of the matter asserted if the statement was made: (1) while the declarant was under oath or under affirmation, or (2) at or near the time of the event, or (3) in the course of a continuous transaction. Since the statement was made to the defendant, it does not meet any of the exceptions.\n\nTherefore, the statement should be ruled inadmissible. The correct answer is C. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
