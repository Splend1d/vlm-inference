Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets\nB. A \"race to the bottom\" in which states compete with one another to have the fewest environmental regulations\nC. A state that legalizes marijuana possession in conflict with federal law\nD. A state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard that is more stringent than that set by the federal government\n\nassistant:Devolution refers to the transfer of power or responsibilities from the central government to regional or local governments. This can involve the decentralization of decision-making processes, allowing states or other entities to have more autonomy in their decision-making.\n\nOption A is an example of devolution, as it allows states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets. This means that states have the power to implement their own strategies for reducing emissions, rather than having a single, nationwide approach.\n\nOption B is not an example of devolution. A \"race to the bottom\" in which states compete with one another to have the fewest environmental regulations is more accurately described as a competition for deregulation or lax environmental standards.\n\nOption C is not an example of devolution. The legalization of marijuana possession in conflict with federal law is more related to the conflict between state and federal laws.\n\nOption D is not an example of devolution. A state being prevented from implementing a fuel efficiency standard that is more stringent than that set by the federal government is more accurately described as a situation where a state's power is being limited by the federal government.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets is an example of devolution.",
