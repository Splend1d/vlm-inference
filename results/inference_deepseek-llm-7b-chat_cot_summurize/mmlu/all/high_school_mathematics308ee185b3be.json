If $2\\star x = 22$, find $x$.\n\nA. 5\nB. 22\nC. 11\nD. 6\n\nassistant:We have $2\\star x = 22$. To find $x$, we need to find the value of $x$ such that $a\\star b = 22$.\n\nSubstituting $a=2$, we get $2^x - 2x = 22$.\n\nLet's simplify the equation by expanding $2^x$:\n\n$2^x - 2x = 2^2 - 2(2) = 2^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0$.\n\nSince $2^x - 2x = 0$, we can conclude that $x = \\boxed{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 6.",
