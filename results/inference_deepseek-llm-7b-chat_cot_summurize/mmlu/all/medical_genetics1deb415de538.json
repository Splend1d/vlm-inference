This statement is incorrect because mapping of human chromosomes is not restricted to the sex chromosomes due to small family sizes. It is a common misconception that the sex chromosomes (X and Y) are the only chromosomes that are used in genetic mapping.\n\nB. This statement is correct. Genetic mapping has proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available. By using DNA markers, researchers can determine the location of genes and other genetic regions on the chromosomes. This has allowed for more accurate mapping of the human genome and has helped to better understand the function of genes and their roles in various diseases and disorders.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect because the number of linkage groups is not determined by the number of chromosomes. Linkage groups are groups of chromosomes that are inherited together. The number of linkage groups is determined by the number of DNA markers that are used in genetic mapping.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect because not all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes. A small percentage of the DNA is involved in coding for genes, while the rest is non-coding DNA. Non-coding DNA plays important roles in regulating gene expression and has other functions in the cell.",
