A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a convalescent home on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum.

Previously, the requirement was for a simple majority vote, but the amendment changed it to a 55% vote in a referendum. This amendment was passed by popular vote, and as such, it is a question of the people's power to control land use matters within their municipality.\n\nThe state constitution grants the people of each municipality the power of referendum with respect to all questions that the municipality is authorized to control by legislation. In this case, the city charter amendment is a question of the people's power to control land use matters within their municipality. Therefore, it is not unconstitutional as a violation of the real estate developer's due process rights, as there is no due process violation here.\n\nThe state constitution also grants the people of each municipality the power of initiative, which allows them to propose laws themselves. This power of initiative is different from the power of referendum, which allows the people to vote on laws proposed by the government or other entities.\n\nThe real estate developer's application for approval of the proposed home on the grounds was rejected because the rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. This decision was made by the city council and the city planning commission, but it was not approved by a 55% vote in a referendum as required by the city charter amendment.\n\nTherefore, the city charter amendment is constitutional as a valid exercise of the power reserved by the people to themselves to control land use matters within their municipality. The court is likely to declare the amendment constitutional, as it is a valid exercise of the city's police power.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. constitutional, as a valid exercise of the city's police power.",
