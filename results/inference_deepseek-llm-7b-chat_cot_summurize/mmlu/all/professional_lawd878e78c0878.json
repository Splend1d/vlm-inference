There is a cause of action because one who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to all who contracts it.\n\nThe woman's husband can sue the paramour for negligence in failing to disclose his venereal disease. The woman was unaware of the disease and was not at fault for contracting it. The appellate court will likely find that the paramour is strictly liable for transmitting the disease and must compensate the husband for his injuries.",
