It is a rotational force, which means it is a force that causes an object to rotate. Torque is measured in units of newton meters (Nm). The relationship between torque and force is that torque is equal to force multiplied by the distance from the axis of rotation. For example, if you apply a force of 100 N to a lever with a distance of 0.5 m from the pivot point, the torque generated will be 100 N * 0.5 m = 50 Nm.",
