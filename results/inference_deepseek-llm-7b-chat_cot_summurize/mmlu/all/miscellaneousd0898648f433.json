This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes, a gentleman, a landed proprietor\u201a\u00c4\u00ecnothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity. Mrs. Fairfax differs from the speaker in that Mrs. Fairfax\n\nA. has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities\nB. judges people by their social station in life\nC. is more willing to take people at face value\nD. has a more positive opinion of Mr. Rochester\n\nassistant:The passage describes Mrs. Fairfax as someone who seems to have no idea of sketching a character or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things. She seems to have a very limited understanding of people and their personalities. On the other hand, the speaker in the passage is puzzled by the user's wish to gain a more definite notion of Mr. Rochester's identity and seems to be more interested in understanding the complexities of people's personalities. Based on this, we can conclude that the speaker is more likely to have a more complex understanding of people's personalities than Mrs. Fairfax.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Mrs. Fairfax has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities.",
