They study Islamic law faithfully.\n\nThe passage mentions that the Malians are Muslims who keep to the prayers, study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and learn the Qur'an by heart. This indicates that they take their Muslim faith seriously and study it diligently. The other options do not provide sufficient evidence for their commitment to their faith. The fact that their genealogy is derived from the maternal side (option A) is unrelated to their faith. The men's lack of sexual jealousy (option C) is not directly related to their faith, and the statement about the women and men having friends and companions (option D) does not provide evidence of their commitment to their faith.",
