You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: If the finite group G contains a subgroup of order seven but no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse, then the order of G could be\n\nA. 27\nB. 28\nC. 35\nD. 37\n\nassistant:To find the order of the group G, we can use the fact that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. In this case, the subgroup has order 7, and there is no element in G that is its own inverse, so there must be no element of order 7 in G. Therefore, the possible orders for G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 20, 24, 28, 40, 48, 60, 84, and 168.\n\nSince there are no other possible orders for G that satisfy the given conditions, the answer is B. 28.",
