The excavation of Yangshao sites has revealed that domesticated crops during this time period included millet, which is mentioned in option B, rice, which is not mentioned, and beans, which is mentioned in option A. Maize, however, was not domesticated in China until much later, during the Neolithic period in Mexico and Central America.\n\nOption C is incorrect because sorghum was domesticated in Africa, not China. Emmer is a type of wheat, which is mentioned in option B, but not mentioned in option A. Option D is incorrect because cabbage is a vegetable, not a domesticated crop. Rice, which is not mentioned in option A, was domesticated in Southeast Asia and not in China during the Yangshao period.",
