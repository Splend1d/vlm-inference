This means that States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, and this obligation does entail an obligation to resolve their disputes. The obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is not just an obligation of conduct, but a strict obligation that all States are under to resolve their disputes as soon as possible.

It is not limited to international courts and tribunals, but applies to all disputes, whether they concern international or non-international law.",
