The firm will shut down to minimize losses if product price falls below average total cost.\nB. The firm will shut down if marginal revenue equals marginal cost but exceeds average variable cost.\nC. The firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss.\nD. The firm will continue to produce as long as average variable cost is less than average fixed cost.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The firm will shut down if marginal revenue equals marginal cost but exceeds average variable cost.\n\nIn the short run, a profit-maximizing firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss. This is because the firm's goal is to maximize profit, and even though it is incurring a loss, the revenue from producing the product is still greater than the variable cost of producing the product. Therefore, the firm will continue to produce.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a profit-maximizing firm would not shut down to minimize losses if the product price falls below average total cost. Instead, the firm would continue to produce and adjust its production levels to maximize profit.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that the firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss. The firm's goal is to maximize profit, and if producing the product is resulting in a loss, the firm may decide to stop producing and focus on other products that generate a profit.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the firm's decision to continue producing is based on the difference between marginal revenue and marginal cost, not on the difference between marginal cost and average variable cost. Therefore, the firm's decision to continue producing is not determined by whether average variable cost is less than average fixed cost.",
