An 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. An 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army.\n\nThe Qin Dynasty emperor Ying Zheng died in 210 BC, and his tomb, known as the Terracotta Army, is considered one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century. The army is made up of over 8,000 life-sized clay soldiers, each with their own unique features, as well as horses, chariots, and other equipment. The purpose of the army was to protect the emperor in the afterlife and to provide him with the means to continue ruling.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Qin Dynasty did not build mortuary temples filled with gold and gems. Option B is also incorrect because the Qin Dynasty did not build pyramids. Option C is incorrect because the Qin Dynasty did not have a collective suicide of 60 members of the royal family as a memorial for the emperor.",
