What is the buoyant force on the rock?\n\nA. 3 N\nB. 5 N\nC. 8 N\nD. None of these\n\nassistant:The buoyant force on the rock can be calculated using Archimedes' Principle, which states that the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. \n\nThe weight of the fluid that the rock displaces is equal to the weight of the rock minus the weight of the fluid that the rock is in contact with. Therefore, the buoyant force on the rock is:\n\nBuoyant force = Weight of rock - Weight of fluid in contact with the rock\nBuoyant force = 5 N - 3 N\nBuoyant force = 2 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 8 N",
