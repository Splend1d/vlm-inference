If properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.\n\nThis statement is true. Observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments if the study is properly designed and controlled for potential biases. In observational studies, researchers observe the behavior of subjects and record the variables of interest, without manipulating any of the variables. If the study is well-designed, it can provide strong evidence of cause-and-effect relationships, just as well as experiments.\n\nOption A is false. While properly designed experiments can suggest strong cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census is not the only way to establish such relationships. Observational studies can also establish cause-and-effect relationships, and controlled experiments are another way to establish cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nOption C is false. Controlled experiments are often undertaken earlier in the research process to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.\n\nOption D is false. A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is not to increase the sample size, but rather to carefully design the study, control for potential confounding variables, and use statistical methods to account for bias. Increasing the sample size can actually increase the risk of bias if the study is not properly designed and controlled.",
