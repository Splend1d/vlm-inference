(-1,1)\n\nassistant:To find the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}$, we need to determine all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies over its domain.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is defined for $x \\in (-1, 1)$. As $x$ approaches 1 from the left, $f(x)$ approaches 0, and as $x$ approaches 1 from the right, $f(x)$ also approaches 0. As $x$ approaches -1 from the left, $f(x)$ approaches infinity, and as $x$ approaches -1 from the right, $f(x)$ also approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $f(x)$ is $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)$. So, the correct answer is option B.",
