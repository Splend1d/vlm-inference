However, I can provide information about the Social Security Act from that time.\n\nThe Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. It was a significant piece of legislation that aimed to provide financial assistance to workers and their families who were unable to work due to old age, disability, or death.\n\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, during the time of the Act's implementation, 60% of the workforce was covered by Social Security. However, it is difficult to estimate the exact percentage of Americans who were in favor of the Act, as public opinion can vary.\n\nTo get a more accurate estimate, you can consult historical sources, such as news articles or polls from the time, or research the opinions of key figures who were involved in the legislation's development.",
