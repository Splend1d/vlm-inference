The native peoples are seen as \"exiled sons\" of the British race, who are sent to serve the \"captives' need\" and to \"wait in heavy harness, on fluttered folk and wild.\" At the same time, they are described as \"savage,\" fighting \"slanderous wars of peace,\" and are seen as \"half-devil and half-child.\" The poem suggests that the British must help the native peoples achieve a lasting peace and conversion to Christianity, but also warns against the difficulties and pitfalls of this endeavor.",
