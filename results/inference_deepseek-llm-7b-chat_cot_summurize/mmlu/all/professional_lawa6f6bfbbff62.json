The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\n\nIn this situation, the husband was present at the premises and explicitly refused to give consent for the search. According to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the police need either a warrant or the consent of the owner of the property to search it. Since the husband refused to consent, the search was not valid. Therefore, the evidence obtained as a result of the search should be suppressed, meaning it cannot be used in court.",
