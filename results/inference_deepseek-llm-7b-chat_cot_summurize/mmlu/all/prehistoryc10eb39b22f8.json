A phylogeny is a diagram or tree-like representation that shows the evolutionary relationships between different kinds of organisms. It helps to illustrate how different species and groups of organisms are related to one another over time. A diastema is a gap or space between two teeth, a mosaic is a pattern made of different colors or materials, and a genus is a group of similar organisms that share common characteristics.",
