Married white male\nB. Unmarried white female\nC. African American, male or female\nD. Youths under the age of 25, male or female\n\nassistant:It is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors such as political ideology, individual values, and personal experiences. However, in general, some studies have shown that members of certain demographic groups tend to lean more towards one political party or the other.\n\nOne study found that married white males were more likely to support Republican presidential candidates, while unmarried white females were more likely to support Democratic candidates. Another study found that African American voters, regardless of gender, were more likely to support Democratic candidates. Finally, a study found that youths under the age of 25 were more likely to support Democratic candidates.\n\nIt is important to note that these findings are not absolute and do not apply to everyone in these demographic groups. Additionally, individual political beliefs and values can vary greatly, and many people do not fit neatly into any one demographic category.",
