Neither investment gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence over either company's operating and financial policies. Which of the two investments should Goll account for using the equity method?\n\nA. Both Rose and Jave.\nB. Rose only.\nC. Jave only.\nD. Neither Rose nor Jave.\n\nassistant:To determine which investment Goll should account for using the equity method, we need to consider the percentage of ownership and the influence it gives Goll over the operating and financial policies of the respective companies.\n\nFor Rose Co., Goll has a 25% interest, which means they have a minority interest. According to accounting standards, a company has a minority interest when it owns less than 50% of the voting power of the investee company. Since Goll cannot exercise significant influence over Rose Co.'s operating and financial policies, they should account for this investment using the equity method.\n\nFor Jave Co., Goll has an 18% interest, which is also a minority interest. However, since they cannot exercise significant influence over Jave Co.'s operating and financial policies either, they should also account for this investment using the equity method.\n\nTherefore, Goll should account for both Rose and Jave using the equity method. The correct answer is A. Both Rose and Jave.",
