Kantian approach\nC. virtue ethics approach\nD. consequentalist approach\n\nassistant:B. Kantian approach\n\nThomson's appeal to the vices of callousness and self-centeredness is related to the Kantian approach to abortion. According to the Kantian approach, actions are morally right if they are performed for the sake of duty, and not for personal gain. In the case of abortion, the Kantian approach would argue that it is morally right to terminate a pregnancy if it is done solely to save the life of the mother, or to prevent severe harm to the mother's health. However, if the abortion is performed for personal gain, such as to avoid the social stigma of being pregnant or to avoid the inconvenience of raising a child, then it would be considered morally wrong according to the Kantian approach.",
