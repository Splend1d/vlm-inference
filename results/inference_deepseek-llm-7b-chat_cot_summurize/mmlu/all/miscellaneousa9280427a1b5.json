These gases are noble gases, which means they do not react with other elements or compounds. They were the most abundant gases in Earth's early atmosphere, making up about 98% of the atmosphere.\n\nA. N_2 and O_3 are nitrogen and oxygen, which are important gases in Earth's atmosphere, but they were not the largest components.\nB. C_2H_4 and O_2 are ethylene and oxygen, which are not the largest components of Earth's early atmosphere.\nD. N_2, H_2O, CO_2, CH_4, and NH_3 are nitrogen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia, which are important gases in Earth's atmosphere, but they were not the largest components.",
