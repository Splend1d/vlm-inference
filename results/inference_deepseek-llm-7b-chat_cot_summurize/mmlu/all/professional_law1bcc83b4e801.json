The resident's remarks constituted slander per se, which is a statement that is defamatory per se, meaning that it is considered to be a serious enough statement to be defamatory without the need to prove special harm or injury. In this case, the resident's statement that the lawyer and his clients were conspiring to commit crimes and that the police should arrest them and put them in jail is a clear and serious statement that would be considered defamatory per se.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. succeed, because the resident's remarks constituted slander per Se.",
