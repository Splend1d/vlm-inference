The proportion of older women is particularly low\n\nassistant:A. Older adults are almost always portrayed in a negative way\n\nResearch has shown that older adults are often depicted in a negative light on TV shows. This can include portrayals of aging as a negative or unattractive process, or of older adults as being frail, forgetful, or isolated. These negative portrayals can perpetuate ageist stereotypes and contribute to age discrimination in society.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there have been some positive portrayals of older adults on TV, and these are becoming more common as the population ages and the media industry becomes more diverse. Positive portrayals can help to challenge ageist stereotypes and promote a more accurate and compassionate view of aging.",
