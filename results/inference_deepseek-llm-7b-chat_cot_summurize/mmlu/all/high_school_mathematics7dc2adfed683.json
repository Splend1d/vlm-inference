If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?\n\nA. 32\nB. 20\nC. 10\nD. 7.2\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. Let's say Noah rides at a speed of $x$ miles per hour. Then, Grady rides at a speed of $1.6x$ miles per hour.\n\nWe know that Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours. Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, we can write the equation:\n\n$1.6x \\cdot \\frac{2}{60} = x \\cdot \\frac{2}{60} + 12$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$0.32x = 12$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$x = \\frac{12}{0.32}$\n\n$x \\approx 37.5$\n\nSo, Noah rides at a speed of approximately $37.5$ miles per hour.
