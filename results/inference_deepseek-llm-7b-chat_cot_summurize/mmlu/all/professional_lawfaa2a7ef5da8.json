When the boss died intestate, her interest in the property passed to her daughter as her heir. However, since the co-worker and the boss were co-owners, their interest in the property was also jointly held. Upon the death of the co-worker, his interest in the property passed to his heirs as well. However, since the co-worker's heirs were not identified, his interest in the property was held by the co-worker himself after the death of the boss. As a result, the co-worker acquired the whole title to the property by right of survivorship. Therefore, the daughter does not have any interest in the property, as the co-worker owns the whole of it.",
