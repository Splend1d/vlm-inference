Body temperature: Mammals, like all warm-blooded animals, maintain a stable body temperature, usually around 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). This is achieved through homeostasis, which helps them regulate their body temperature in response to changes in their environment.\n\nB. Blood glucose concentration: Mammals have a mechanism to regulate blood glucose levels, which is essential for energy production and maintaining a healthy body. Homeostasis helps them maintain a stable blood glucose concentration by regulating the uptake, utilization, and storage of glucose.\n\nC. Blood pH: Mammals have a mechanism to regulate blood pH, which is crucial for proper functioning of cells and organs. Homeostasis helps them maintain a stable blood pH by regulating the release of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions.\n\nD. Metabolic rate: While mammals do have a homeostatic mechanism to regulate their metabolic rate, it is not the only factor that determines their metabolic rate. Factors such as body size, age, and activity level can also affect metabolic rate. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that mammals are homeostatic for metabolic rate.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Metabolic rate.",
