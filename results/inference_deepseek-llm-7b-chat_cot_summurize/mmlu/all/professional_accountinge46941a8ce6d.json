If the discount rate is 10%, what is the project\u2019s NPV?\n\nA. \u2212$3\nB. \u2212$27\nC. $3\nD. $500\n\nassistant:To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of this investment project, we can use the formula:\n\nNPV = $500 - (Discount factor * (500 + 500)) / (Discount factor - 1)\n\nWhere the discount factor is calculated as:\n\nDiscount factor = e ^ (-r * t)\n\nIn this case, the discount rate (r) is 10% (0.10), and the time periods (t) are 5 years and 10 years.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount factors:\n\nDiscount factor for year 5 = e ^ (-0.10 * 5) = e ^ (-0.5) \u2248 0.3679\nDiscount factor for year 10 = e ^ (-0.10 * 10) = e ^ (-1) = 0.3679\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the NPV formula:\n\nNPV = $500 - (0.3679 * (500 + 500)) / (0.3679 - 1)\nNPV = $500 - (0.3679 * 1000) / (-0.6321)\nNPV = $500 + (1000 * 0.3679) / (-0.6321)\nNPV = $500 - $367.90\nNPV \u2248 $132.10\n\nThe project's NPV is approximately $132.10, which is option C.",
