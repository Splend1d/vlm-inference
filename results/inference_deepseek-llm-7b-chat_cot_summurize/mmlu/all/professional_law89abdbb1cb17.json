The defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense when he was attacked by the victim. At trial, the defendant called a witness who testified that he witnessed the altercation and that the victim was the aggressor. The witness further testified that he has known the defendant for 10 years and that the defendant is a peaceable man who was acting reasonably in self-defense. The prosecution then offered the testimony of the victim's brother-in-law, who proposed to testify that the victim was a peaceable and law-abiding person. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the brother-in-law's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, for the purpose of rebutting the contention that the defendant was a peaceable person.\nB. admissible, for the purpose of repudiating the defendant's claim of self-defense.\nC. inadmissible, because the victim's character cannot be proved by the brother-in-law's testimony.\nD. inadmissible, because the defendant did not directly attack the victim's character.\n\nassistant:The brother-in-law's testimony is inadmissible because the victim's character cannot be proved by the brother-in-law's testimony. The brother-in-law is not a witness to the events leading up to the altercation and his testimony about the victim's character is irrelevant to the defendant's claim of self-defense. Therefore, the correct answer is C. inadmissible.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question and the relevant laws.\n- The defendant is charged with killing a victim in a barroom fight.\n- The defendant claims self-defense.\n- The prosecution and defense call witnesses to testify about the events leading up to the fight and the defendant's character.\n- The victim's brother-in-law is proposed to testify about the victim's character.\n\nStep 2: Apply the relevant legal principle.\n- The brother-in-law's proposed testimony is inadmissible because the victim's character cannot be proved by the brother-in-law's testimony. This is in line with the rule that character evidence is generally inadmissible unless it is offered to prove that the defendant had a propensity to commit the crime.\n\nStep 3: Justify the answer.\n- The brother-in-law's testimony is not relevant to the issue of self-defense, and therefore cannot be admitted. The correct answer is C. inadmissible.",
