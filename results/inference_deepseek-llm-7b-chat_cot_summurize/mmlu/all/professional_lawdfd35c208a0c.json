In this case, the plaintiffs are seeking review of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court may hear the case if it involves a federal issue.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court may hear the case, but it does not have the option to remand the case back to a federal district court.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the U.S. Supreme Court may hear the federal issues involved, but it does not have the option to decline to rule on the state issue.\n\nOption D is correct because the U.S. Supreme Court may rely on the advisory opinion rendered by the state attorney general and decline to hear the case on its merits. In this case, the advisory opinion stated that the measure did not violate any statutory or constitutional provisions, and the state supreme court found the case to be constitutional under both state and federal law. If the U.S. Supreme Court decides to rely on this advisory opinion, it may decline to hear the case on its merits.",
