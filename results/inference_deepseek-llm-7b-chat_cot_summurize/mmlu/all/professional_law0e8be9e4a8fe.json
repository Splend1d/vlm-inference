An adverse possessor takes title subject to an equitable lien from the dispossessed owner, and the buyer has a valid reason for not wanting to purchase the property. Therefore, the man will not prevail in his action for specific performance.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The man's action for specific performance is not a matter of law, but rather a matter of equity, and the third party is not a necessary party to the action.\n\nB. An action in rem does not automatically give the vendor the right to prevail in the case, as it depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.\n\nD. Specific performance is an equitable remedy, and the buyer's unwillingness to buy a lawsuit does not necessarily mean that the buyer cannot be required to buy the property.",
