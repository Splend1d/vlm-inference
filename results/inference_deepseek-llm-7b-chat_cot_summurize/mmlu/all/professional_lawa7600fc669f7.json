The student argues that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.\n\nThe confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment states that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right...to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" The confrontation clause is designed to ensure that the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses against him or her.\n\nIn this case, the friend was available to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the student was able to cross-examine the friend. Therefore, the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing did not violate the student's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial: This option is incorrect because the student had the opportunity to cross-examine the friend at the preliminary hearing.\n\nB. Granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable: This option is incorrect because the friend was available to testify at the preliminary hearing, and the transcript was not admitted for the sole purpose of showing that the friend was unavailable.\n\nD. Denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule: This option is incorrect because the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony was not based on it being a statement by a co-conspirator.",
