This is because ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the primary source of energy for high-intensity exercise, and it is stored in the muscle's muscle fibers. When the muscle contracts, the stored ATP is broken down, releasing energy that is used to power the movement. However, the ATP store in muscle has a limited capacity, and it can only supply energy for about 20 seconds of high intensity exercise before it is depleted. After that, the muscle will need to rest or switch to using other energy sources such as glycogen or fat.",
