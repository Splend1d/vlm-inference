If a solution of nitrous acid is found to have a pH of 4.2, what can be said about the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair found in solution?\n\nA. [HNO2] > [NO2-]\nB. [NO2-] > [HNO2]\nC. [H2NO2+] > [HNO2]\nD. [HNO2] > [H2NO2+]\n\nassistant:The pKa value of a weak acid tells us the pH at which half of the acid's molecules will exist as its conjugate base. In this case, the pKa value of nitrous acid (HNO2) is 3.3. This means that at a pH of 4.2, half of the nitrous acid molecules will have turned into their conjugate base, nitrous acid.\n\nLet's denote the equilibrium constant for the reaction of nitrous acid with water as K_p. At equilibrium, the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are related to each other and to the concentration of water by the following equation:\n\n[HNO2] = [H2O] * K_p\n[NO2-] = [H2O] * (K_p / K_w)\n\nwhere K_w is the equilibrium constant for the reaction of water with a conjugate base, which is equal to 10^-14.\n\nAt a pH of 4.2, half of the nitrous acid molecules will have turned into their conjugate base. Therefore, the concentration of the conjugate acid (HNO2) will be half of the initial concentration.\n\n[HNO2] = (1/2) * [HNO2]\n\nSolving for [HNO2], we get:\n\n[HNO2] = 0.5 * [HNO2]\n\nSince [HNO2] cannot be equal to 0 (as the pH is 4.2), we can conclude that the concentration of the conjugate acid (HNO2) is greater than half of the initial concentration. Therefore, the answer is A. [HNO2] > [NO2-].",
