In accordance with the bylaws of the league's charter, the commissioner was required to obtain the approval of at least half the owners before raising his expense allocation. At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation. The commissioner's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.\nB. admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the league's charter is the best evidence.\n\nassistant:The commissioner's testimony is C. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nIn order for the commissioner's predecessor's statement to be admissible as evidence, it must fall within one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. One exception is the \"business record\" exception, which allows for the admission of records that were kept in the regular course of business for the purpose of assisting in the conduct of the business. However, the business record exception requires that the record be made at or near the time of the event it describes, and that it was made in the regular course of the business. If the commissioner's predecessor's statement was made after the fact, or if it was not made in the regular course of the business, it would not be admissible under the business record exception.\n\nAnother exception to the hearsay rule is the \"present sense impression\" exception, which allows for the admission of statements that the declarant is making while the event is still going on. However, this exception only applies to statements that the declarant is making in response to an event that is taking place at the time of the statement. If the statement was made after the event had already occurred, it would not be admissible under the present sense impression exception.\n\nFinally, there is the \"business record\" exception, which allows for the admission of records that were kept in the regular course of business for the purpose of assisting in the conduct of the business. However, this exception requires that the record be made at or near the time of the event it describes, and that it was made in the regular course of the business. If the record was not made at or near the time of the event it describes, or if it was not made in the regular course of the business, it would not be admissible under this exception.\n\nGiven that the commissioner's predecessor's statement was made after the fact, and there is no information provided about when or how the statement was made, it is likely that the statement would not be admissible under any of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. Therefore, the commissioner's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
