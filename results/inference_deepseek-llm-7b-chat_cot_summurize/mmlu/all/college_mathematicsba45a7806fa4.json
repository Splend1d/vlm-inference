We are given that f is a linear transformation from the plane to the real numbers, and we are given two specific points, (1, 1) and (-1, 0), and their corresponding images under f.\n\nLet's first find the general form of the linear transformation. Since f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2, we can write the transformation as:\n\nf(x, y) = ax + by + c\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation:\n\n1 = a(1) + b(1) + c\n2 = a(-1) + b(0) + c\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n1 = a + b + c\n2 = -a + 0 + c\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express a in terms of b and c:\n\na = 1 - b - c\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n2 = -(1 - b - c) + c\n2 = 1 - b + 2c\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nb + c = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of a and b + c into the general form of the linear transformation:\n\nf(x, y) = (1 - b - c)x + (b + c)y + c\n\nWe want to find f(3, 5), so let's substitute x = 3 and y = 5 into the equation:\n\nf(3, 5) = (1 - b - c)(3) + (b + c)(5) + c\n\nSince b + c = 1, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nf(3, 5) = (1 - b - c)(3) + (1)(5) + c\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values of f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2:\n\n1 = a(1) + b(1) + c\n2 = a(-1) + b(0) + c\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express a in terms of b and c:\n\na = 1 - b - c\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n2 = -(1 - b - c) + c\n2 = 1 - b + 2c\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nb + c = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of a and b + c into the general form of the linear transformation:\n\nf(x, y) = (1 - b - c)x + (b + c)y + c\n\nWe want to find f(3, 5), so let's substitute x = 3 and y = 5 into the equation:\n\nf(3, 5) = (1 - b - c)(3) + (b + c)(5) + c\n\nSince b + c = 1, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nf(3, 5) = (1 - b - c)(3) + (1)(5) + c\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values of f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2:\n\n1 = a(1) + b(1) + c\n2 = a(-1) + b(0) + c\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express a in terms of b and c:\n\na = 1 - b - c\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n2 = -(1 - b - c) + c\n2 = 1 - b + 2c\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nb + c = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of a and b + c into the general form of the linear transformation:\n\nf(x, y) = (1 - b - c)x + (b + c)y + c\n\nWe want to find f(3, 5), so let's substitute x = 3 and y = 5 into the equation:\n\nf(3, 5) = (1 - b - c)(3) + (b + c)(5) + c\n\nSince b + c = 1, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nf(3, 5) = (1 - b - c)(3) + (",
