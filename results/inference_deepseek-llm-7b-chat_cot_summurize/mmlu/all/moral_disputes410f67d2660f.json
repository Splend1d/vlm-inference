A zygote is the earliest stage of development, a blastocyst is when the embryo implants in the uterus, and an embryo is a general term that includes all stages from zygote to blastocyst but does not specifically refer to the point where the basic structure of the kind is present. A fetus, on the other hand, has developed to the point of having the basic structure that is characteristic of its kind.",
