Its toxic effects are observed only at doses 100x the EDI\nD. Its benefits outweigh its risks\n\nassistant:A food additive is considered to be safe when it meets the criteria mentioned in option D. The toxic effects of a food additive are usually observed at doses that are much higher than the estimated daily intake (EDI) from its presence in food. The EDI is the average daily intake of a substance that is considered safe over a long period of time, and it is calculated based on the amount of the substance that is typically consumed by people. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is the daily intake of a substance that is considered safe over a lifetime. If the EDI from a food additive is less than its ADI, then it is considered safe to use in food. However, even if a food additive is considered safe, it is still important to use it in moderation and to consult with a healthcare professional before using any food additive or supplement.",
