It is made by striking a large rock against a smaller, softer stone, which removes flakes from the larger rock. These flakes can then be used as tools. In contrast, a hand axe is a later type of stone tool that was developed around 1.5 million years ago. It is made by shaping a single piece of stone into a more symmetrical and durable form. Therefore, a hand axe does not require the removal of many flakes, as is the case with an Oldowan tool.\n\nA. is incorrect because a hand axe is made out of stone, not wood or bone.\nB. is incorrect because a hand axe does not need constant cleaning and maintenance.\nC. is incorrect because a hand axe does not require metal or a source of heat to be forged.",
