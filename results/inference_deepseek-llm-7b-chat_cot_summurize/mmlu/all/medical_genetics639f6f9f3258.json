It is widely used in plant genetics research because of its advantages in comparison to other plant species. One of the primary reasons for this is its small genome size, which is relatively easy to map and study compared to the larger genomes of other plant species. Additionally, Arabidopsis can be grown and maintained at a low cost, making it an affordable choice for researchers. These factors make Arabidopsis an advantageous plant for plant genetic research.",
