What is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31 using the double-declining method of depreciation?\n\nA. $8,000\nB. $7,000\nC. $5,333\nD. 4667\n\nassistant:To calculate the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31 using the double-declining method of depreciation, we will first find the depreciation rate and then apply it to the cost of the asset.\n\nThe double-declining method of depreciation has equal depreciation rates in the first and last years of the asset's life. Since the asset has a 3-year life, we will divide the total depreciation expense by 3 to find the depreciation rate.\n\nDepreciation rate = Total depreciation expense / Asset life\nDepreciation rate = $5,333 / 3\nDepreciation rate = $1,777.67 per year\n\nNow, we will apply the depreciation rate to the cost of the asset.\n\nDepreciation expense = Cost of asset \u00d7 Depreciation rate\nDepreciation expense = $12,000 \u00d7 1,777.67\nDepreciation expense = $21,337.64\n\nTo find the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, we will subtract the depreciation expense for the first year (since we are applying the depreciation rate for the second year).\n\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31 = Depreciation expense \u00d7 (1 - Salvage value / Cost of asset)\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31 = $21,337.64 \u00d7 (1 - $1,500 / $12,000)\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31 = $21,337.64 \u00d7 (0.8)\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31 = $17,069.31\n\nThe correct answer is C. $5,333.",
