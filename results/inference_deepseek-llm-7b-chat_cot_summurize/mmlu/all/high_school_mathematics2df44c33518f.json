After her sixth try she brought her median time down to 92 seconds. What was her time, in seconds, for her sixth attempt?\n\nA. 92\nB. 90\nC. 87\nD. 10\n\nassistant:To determine Sarah's time for her sixth attempt, we first need to find the median time from her previous five attempts. The median is the middle value when the times are arranged in ascending order.\n\nArranging the times in ascending order: 86, 88, 94, 96, 97\n\nSince there are five times (an odd number), the median is the middle value, which is 88 seconds.\n\nWe know that Sarah's time for her sixth attempt was 92 seconds. Since this is higher than the median, her time for her sixth attempt must be the new median time.\n\nTherefore, her time for her sixth attempt was 88 seconds.\n\nThe answer is A: 92",
