It triples the interval size.\nB. It divides the interval size by 3.\nC. It multiples the interval size by 1.732.\nD. It divides the interval size by 1.732.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Tripling the sample size is equivalent to multiplying the confidence interval by 3^(1/2), which is approximately 1.732. Therefore, the confidence interval size is multiplied by 1.732 when the sample size is tripled.",
