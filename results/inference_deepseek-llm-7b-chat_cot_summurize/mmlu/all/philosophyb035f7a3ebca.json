This is because Hume believes that aesthetic value is a subjective experience that varies from person to person, and there is no objective standard or criteria that can be universally applied to determine what is beautiful or valuable. He believes that our judgments of beauty are based on our personal experiences, emotions, and perceptions, and that there is no objective basis for determining what is beautiful or valuable in art or nature.",
