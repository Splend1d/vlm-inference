This means that embryos have all the genetic information needed to develop into a fully functional human being, and therefore, they are considered complete human beings from a genetic perspective. This is in contrast to cells of the mother or father, which are not genetically human and do not have the potential to develop into a fully functional human being.\n\nThe other options are not accurate. Option B suggests that human embryos are complete human beings because their growth is directed toward survival and maturation, but this is not a sufficient reason to consider them complete human beings. Option C suggests that human embryos are complete human beings because they are both complete organisms and genetically human, but this is not a valid argument because it repeats the information in option A. Option D suggests that human embryos are not complete human beings because neither option A nor B is true, but this is not a valid argument because both options A and B are true and therefore, human embryos are considered complete human beings.",
