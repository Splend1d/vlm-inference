The law established a commission, consisting of five individuals, that was in charge of licensing and overseeing the activities of the casinos. The members of the commission were to be appointed by the mayor. Pursuant to his statutory power, the mayor appointed four private citizens and a clergy member to the Commission.

By appointing a clergy member to the commission, the mayor is showing favoritism towards religious individuals, which is unconstitutional.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The appointment of the clergy member does not give the commission enforcement powers, so this answer is not applicable.\nC. While the primary effect of appointing only one religious member to the commission may not advance or inhibit religion, the constitutional challenge is based on the fact that the appointment fosters excessive governmental entanglement with religion, not on the primary effect.\nD. While the commission membership is an appointive privilege, the fact that it fosters excessive governmental entanglement with religion makes it unconstitutional.",
