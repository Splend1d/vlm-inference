What is the smallest positive integer, $n,$ for which $x^2+xy+y^2+n$ is a multiple of $7$?\n\nA. 2\nB. 6\nC. 4\nD. 5\n\nassistant:Let $x-3$ and $y+3$ be multiples of $7$. Then $x-3$ can be written as $7k$ for some integer $k$, and $y+3$ can be written as $7m$ for some integer $m$. \n\nSubstituting these expressions into the expression $x^2+xy+y^2+n$, we get:\n\n$(7k)^2 + (7k)(y+3) + (7m)^2 + n = 49k^2 + 49k(y+3) + 49m^2 + n$\n\nSince $7k$ and $7m$ are multiples of $7$, we can factor them out:\n\n$7(k^2 + 7k) + 7(m^2 + 7m) + n = 7(k^2 + 7k + m^2 + 7m) + n$\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $k^2 + 7k + m^2 + 7m$. We can rewrite this expression as:\n\n$(k^2 + m^2) + (7k + 7m)$\n\nSince $k$ and $m$ are integers, $k^2 + m^2$ is always a non-negative integer, and $7k + 7m$ is always a multiple of $7$. Therefore, $k^2 + m^2 + 7k + 7m$ is always a multiple of $7$.\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the original equation, we get:\n\n$7(k^2 + 7k + m^2 + 7m) + n = 7(k^2 + 7k + m^2 + 7m) + n$\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, the smallest positive integer $n$ that makes the entire expression a multiple of $7$ is $n = \\boxed{0}$.",
