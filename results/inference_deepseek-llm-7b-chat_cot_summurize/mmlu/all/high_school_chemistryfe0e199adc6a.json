The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\n\nThe heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat required to cause a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. Since the sample's temperature changed more than the water's temperature, it means that the sample required more heat to raise its temperature by 1 degree Celsius. This implies that the heat capacity of the sample is greater than the heat capacity of the water.",
