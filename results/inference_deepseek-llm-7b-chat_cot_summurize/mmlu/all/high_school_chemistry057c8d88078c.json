CO2:\n- The central atom is carbon.\n- The bonds are CO (C-O) and O2 (C=O).\n- The hybridization around carbon is sp2.\n\n2. CO32-:\n- The central atom is carbon.\n- The bonds are CO (C=O) and O32- (C-O).\n- The hybridization around carbon is sp3.\n\n3. NO2-:\n- The central atom is nitrogen.\n- The bonds are N-O and O2- (O=O).\n- The hybridization around nitrogen is sp3.\n\n4. NO3-:\n- The central atom is nitrogen.\n- The bonds are N-O and O3- (O=O).\n- The hybridization around nitrogen is sp3.\n\nBased on the Lewis structures of these molecules, we can see that only CO2 exhibits sp2 hybridization around the central atom (carbon). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. CO2 and CO32-",
