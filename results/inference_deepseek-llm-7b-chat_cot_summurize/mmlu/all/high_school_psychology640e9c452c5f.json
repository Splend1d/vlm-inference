After serving 120 dinners, Tamika told her mother how happy she is that they can afford to buy delicious foods she loves. Tamika's increased perception that she is happy is best explained by applying which of the following theories?\n\nA. relative deprivation\nB. adaptation-level\nC. Yerkes-Dodson arousal\nD. diathesis-stress\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. relative deprivation.\n\nTamika's happiness comes from the realization that she has more than she thought she did. Her mother listens to her concerns and they both go to a soup kitchen to volunteer, which allows Tamika to appreciate the things she has. This is an example of relative deprivation, where a person's sense of well-being can be influenced by comparing their situation to others.\n\nThe other options are not applicable in this case. B. adaptation-level refers to the adjustment of a person's responses to a new or changed environment, which is not relevant to Tamika's happiness. C. Yerkes-Dodson arousal is a relationship between performance and anxiety, which is not relevant to Tamika's happiness. D. diathesis-stress refers to the interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors, which is not relevant to Tamika's happiness.",
