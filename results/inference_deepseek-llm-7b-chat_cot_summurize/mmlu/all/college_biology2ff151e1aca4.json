This is because the sunlight can penetrate the water more easily in the neritic zone, and the upwelling of nutrients from the deep sea brings nutrients to the surface, where they can support the growth of marine life.\n\nA bathyl zone is a marine ecosystem region that is deep underwater, where there is little to no penetration of solar radiation, and where the temperature and pressure are high.\n\nA pelagic zone is a marine ecosystem region that is open water, where there is little to no contact with the seafloor.\n\nA benthyl zone is a marine ecosystem region that is near the seafloor, where there is a lot of contact with the seafloor.",
