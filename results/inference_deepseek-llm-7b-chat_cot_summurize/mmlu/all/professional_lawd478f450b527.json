The student's suspension did not constitute a denial of due process. The student was given an opportunity to discuss the matter with the principal and the school board, and his parents were also informed about the hearing. Therefore, the suspension did not deprive the student of liberty or property without due process, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Additionally, the student's conduct was not protected under the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, as the use of profanity and abusive language towards a teacher and fellow student is not considered protected speech. Lastly, the disciplinary code did not violate the student's right to a compulsory school education, as the student was still required to attend school during the suspension period.",
