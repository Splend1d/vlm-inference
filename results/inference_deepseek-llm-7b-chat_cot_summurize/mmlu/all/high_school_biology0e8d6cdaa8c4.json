The hybrid tomato plant is stronger and produces better fruit than the pure genotype.\nB. There are two distinct varieties in one population of snail that inhabits an island in the Pacific Ocean.\nC. Males of some species have long antlers to fight other males for females.\nD. In one species of rabbit, the ones that evolved in the cold, snowy north are white, while the ones that evolved in the south are brown.\n\nassistant:A cline is a geographic distribution of a trait in a population of organisms, where the trait varies systematically along a geographic gradient. In other words, a cline is a geographic cline.\n\nOption A is an example of a hybrid vigor, which refers to the improved fitness or performance of a hybrid compared to its pure parentage.\n\nOption B is an example of a distinct genetic variation within a population.\n\nOption C is an example of sexual selection, where males of some species have evolved traits for attracting females.\n\nOption D is an example of Bergmann's rule, which states that organisms living in colder climates tend to be larger and darker in color. This is thought to help them conserve heat.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. In one species of rabbit, the ones that evolved in the cold, snowy north are white, while the ones that evolved in the south are brown.",
