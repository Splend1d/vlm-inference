Longitude\nB. Latitude\nC. Equator\nD. Distance to the nearest city\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will consider the options and their relevance to the field of geography and determining absolute location.\n\nA. Longitude: Longitude is a measurement used in geography to determine the absolute location of a point on the Earth's surface. It is an east-west coordinate that helps to locate a specific point with precision. So, this is a correct option.\n\nB. Latitude: Latitude is another measurement used in geography to determine the absolute location of a point on the Earth's surface. It is a north-south coordinate that helps to locate a specific point with precision. So, this is also a correct option.\n\nC. Equator: The Equator is a line of latitude that divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. While it is not used directly to determine the absolute location of a point on the Earth's surface, it is important in geography as it is the reference line for latitudes. So, this is not a correct option.\n\nD. Distance to the nearest city: This is not a measure used by geographers to determine the absolute location of a point on the Earth's surface. Rather, it is a measure of proximity, which can be derived from the absolute location using additional geographic information.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is D. Distance to the nearest city.",
