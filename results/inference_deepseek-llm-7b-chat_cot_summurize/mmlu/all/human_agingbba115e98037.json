Have higher reliability.\n\nProjective tests are a type of personality test that are designed to tap into a person's unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motivations. They typically involve ambiguous or open-ended questions or tasks that the test-taker is asked to complete. These types of tests are often considered more subjective and less reliable than objective tests, which use clear and specific questions and tasks to measure specific traits or behaviors. Objective tests are considered more reliable because they are easier to score and compare, and the results are less likely to be influenced by the tester's biases or the test-taker's responses.",
