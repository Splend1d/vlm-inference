The current value of y\nB. Zero\nC. One\nD. The average value of the change in y over the in-sample period\n\nassistant:To determine the optimal one-step ahead forecast of the change in y, we need to consider the random walk with drift b. The change in y is given by:\n\n\u0394y = b + Z\n\nwhere b is the drift, Z is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance \u03c3^2, and \u0394y is the change in y.\n\nThe mean of Z is 0, which means that the expected value of Z is 0. Therefore, the expected value of \u0394y is also 0.\n\nSo, the optimal one-step ahead forecast of the change in y is:\n\nB. Zero.",
