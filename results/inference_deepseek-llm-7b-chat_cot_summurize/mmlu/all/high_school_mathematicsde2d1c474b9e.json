Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nA. \\frac{31}{66}\nB. \\frac{17}{66}\nC. \\frac{17}{31}\nD. \\frac{17}{50}\n\nassistant:We want to find the number of integers in the set $$\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,100\\}$$ that are divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.\nTo do this, we can count the number of integers in the set that are divisible by 2 and count the number of integers in the set that are not divisible by 3.\n\nThe number of integers in the set that are divisible by 2 is 50, since every even number from 2 to 100 is divisible by 2.\n\nThe number of integers in the set that are not divisible by 3 is 74, since we can count the multiples of 3 from 1 to 99 and subtract them from the total (100-1+1=50).\n\nTherefore, the number of integers in the set that are divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 is 50, so the probability is 50/100 = 1/2 = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not listed in the options. The correct answer is 0.5.\nThe answer is: 0.5",
