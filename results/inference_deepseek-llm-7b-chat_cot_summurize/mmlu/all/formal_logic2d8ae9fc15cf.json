E \u2283 F\nThis statement is a conditional statement where E must be true for F to be true.\n\n2. G \u2283 ~F / ~G \u2228 ~E\nThis statement is a conditional statement where G must be true or E must be false for ~F to be true.\n\nNow let's examine the indirect truth tables for these statements:\n\nFor the first statement (E \u2283 F), let's consider three cases:\n\nCase 1: E is true. In this case, F is also true.\nCase 2: E is false. In this case, F is true or false.\n\nFor the second statement (G \u2283 ~F / ~G \u2228 ~E), let's consider four cases:\n\nCase 1: G is true and ~F is true. In this case, F is false, and E is false.\nCase 2: G is true and ~F is false. In this case, F is false, and E is true.\nCase 3: G is false and ~F is true. In this case, F is false, and E is false.\nCase 4: G is false and ~F is false. In this case, F is false, and E is true.\n\nNow let's examine the third statement (G \u2283 ~F / ~G \u2228 ~E). We know that G must be true or ~E must be true for ~F to be true. This means that ~F is true when either G is true or ~E is true.\n\nNow let's examine the first statement (E \u2283 F). We know that E must be true for F to be true.\n\nSince the second statement (G \u2283 ~F / ~G \u2228 ~E) has a case where G is true and ~F is true, and the third statement (G \u2283 ~F / ~G \u2228 ~E) has a case where G is true and ~F is true, the two statements are equivalent. This means that the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Valid",
