This mutation leads to the production of a faulty CFTR protein, which disrupts the normal functioning of the cell's chloride channel. The most common type of mutation is a duplication, where an additional segment of DNA is inserted into the CFTR gene, resulting in a CFTR protein that is shorter than normal and unable to perform its functions properly. Other types of mutations include deletions, substitutions, and insertions, but they are less common.",
