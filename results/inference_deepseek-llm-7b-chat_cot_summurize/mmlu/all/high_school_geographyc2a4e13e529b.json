Winn-Dixie grocery store\nB. Mercedes-Benz dealership\nC. Shoe store\nD. Family doctor\n\nassistant:A higher-order central place function is a type of central place theory that involves multiple levels of aggregation. Based on the given options, the higher-order central place function could be considered a Mercedes-Benz dealership.\n\nMercedes-Benz dealerships are typically located in large urban areas and serve as a central place for customers to purchase and service Mercedes-Benz vehicles. These dealerships are not only a central place for the sale of cars, but also a central place for the servicing and maintenance of those cars. This makes it a higher-order central place function, as it serves multiple levels of aggregation (sale of cars, servicing and maintenance of cars).",
