Blackbody radiation curves\nB. Emission spectra of diatomic molecules\nC. Electron diffraction patterns\nD. Temperature dependence of reaction rates\n\nassistant:Planck's quantum theory explained several experimental observations, but the one that matches with option A is the Blackbody radiation curves. The theory proposed that electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is emitted by objects in discrete packets, or quanta, of energy. This idea, known as quantization, is a key feature of blackbody radiation and was confirmed through experimental observations.\n\nOption B, the emission spectra of diatomic molecules, is related to the quantum theory of atoms, which was developed later by other scientists. Electron diffraction patterns are explained by the wave-particle duality of matter, not necessarily by Planck's quantum theory.\n\nFinally, option D, the temperature dependence of reaction rates, is related to statistical mechanics, not quantum theory. Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of systems with a large number of particles, and it explains the behavior of the particles at the macroscopic level.\n\nIn summary, only option A, Blackbody radiation curves, can be directly attributed to Planck's quantum theory.",
