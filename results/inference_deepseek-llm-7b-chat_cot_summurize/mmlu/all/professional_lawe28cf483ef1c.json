One afternoon, a 9-year-old victim was riding her bicycle along the street. As the victim swerved into the southbound lane, her bicycle was struck by a car driven by the defendant. The victim was knocked off her bike and thrown onto the sidewalk adjacent to the street. Although the victim received some minor scrapes and bruises, she was not seriously injured.

The car almost instantly caught fire as its gas tank exploded. The victim, who was engulfed in the flaming wreckage, was killed. If the defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of the victim, the defendant should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she unlawfully fled the scene of an accident in violation of her statutory duty.\nB. guilty, because her failure to render aid to the victim would make the defendant criminally responsible for the victim's death.\nC. not guilty, because under the circumstances her failure to aid the victim cannot be a basis for imposing criminal responsibility for the victim's death.\nD. not guilty, because there was not a sufficient causal connection between her actions and the victim's death to impose criminal responsibility.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. guilty, because she unlawfully fled the scene of an accident in violation of her statutory duty. The defendant's failure to stop and render aid after the accident led to the victim's death due to the subsequent accident. This constitutes a violation of the hit-and-run statute, which makes it a crime to leave the scene of an accident. As a result, the defendant should be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the death of the victim.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the defendant's failure to render aid is not the sole cause of the victim's death. The subsequent accident and the tractor-trailer's impact are also factors that contributed to the victim's death.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the defendant's failure to stop and render aid at the scene of the accident directly led to the victim's death.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is a causal connection between the defendant's actions and the victim's death, as stated in the question. The defendant's hit-and-run led to the victim's death due to the subsequent accident.",
