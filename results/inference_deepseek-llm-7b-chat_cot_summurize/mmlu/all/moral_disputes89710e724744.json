This philosophy holds that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of the circumstances or the consequences of those actions.\n\nAmong the options provided, Nagel's absolutist position is most closely associated with option C: \"the ends justify the means.\" This is because Nagel's absolutism does not allow for the idea that the ends or results of an action can make it morally permissible. Instead, he believes that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of the outcomes.\n\nOption A, \"human persons have a right to life,\" is not directly related to Nagel's absolutism. Although Nagel did believe that certain actions were always wrong, he did not believe that there were certain rights that all human beings had.\n\nOption B, \"it is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence of action,\" is also not directly related to Nagel's absolutism. While Nagel did believe that certain actions were always wrong, he did not believe that it was ever permissible to harm someone as a foreseen but unintended consequence of an action.\n\nOption D, \"the hostility should be directed at its true object,\" is not directly related to Nagel's absolutism. While Nagel did believe that certain actions were always wrong, he did not believe that the hostility should be directed at any specific object. Instead, he believed that the hostility should be directed at certain actions.",
