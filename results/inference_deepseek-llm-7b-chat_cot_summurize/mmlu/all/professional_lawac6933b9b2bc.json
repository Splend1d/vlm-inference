If the professor admitted to knowingly giving the graduate an undeserved grade based on false information, this would not be considered a true statement made in good faith. Therefore, the court would not allow the professor to use this evidence as a defense.\n\nThe other options are not relevant to the truth defense:\n\nB. another professor told him that the graduate had cheated on an admiralty law final examination. - This is not relevant to the professor's claim that the graduate cheated in the entertainment law class.\nC. the findings of the law school indicated that the graduate had submitted a plagiarized paper in a moot court brief. - This is not relevant to the professor's claim that the graduate cheated in the entertainment law class.\nD. the reputation among the graduate's fellow classmates was that he frequently cheated on law school examinations. - This is not relevant to the professor's claim that the graduate cheated in the entertainment law class.",
