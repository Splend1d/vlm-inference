Lenin, in which he emphasizes the importance of industrialization for the independence and security of his country. He argues that without a strong industrial basis, the Soviet regime and socialist construction cannot be upheld. Lenin also emphasizes the need for a fast rate of development in the country's industry, and the importance of placing agriculture on a new technical basis.\n\nOption A, \"His exile in Switzerland and other places led him to see how the industrialization of the West was needed in the Soviet Union,\" is not the most likely influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize his new nation. While Lenin may have observed the benefits of industrialization in the West during his exile, the speech does not mention this as the primary reason for his desire to industrialize.\n\nOption B, \"Russia had a large percentage of its population working in factories before the revolution occurred, and he wanted to build on that,\" is also not the most likely influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize. The speech does not mention any desire to build on pre-revolutionary industrial infrastructure.\n\nOption D, \"The humiliating defeat of Russia during the First World War had led to his rise to power and he knew another defeat would spell his doom,\" is not the most likely influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize. While the defeat of Russia during the First World War may have been a factor in Lenin's rise to power, the speech does not focus on this as the primary reason for his desire to industrialize.\n\nOption C, \"Trotsky was able to lead the Bolshevik revolt in 1917 because he had control of the rail and telegraph stations,\" is the most likely influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize. The speech mentions that Trotsky was able to lead the Bolshevik revolt in 1917 due to his control of the rail and telegraph stations. This suggests that Lenin saw the importance of infrastructure, such as rail and telegraph stations, in the successful execution of his plans for industrialization and socialist construction.\n\nTherefore, the most likely event that was the greatest influence on Lenin in his desire to industrialize his new nation was the ability of Trotsky to lead the Bolshevik revolt in 1917 due to control of the rail and telegraph stations.",
