H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which causes the solid to form liquid under high pressure conditions.\n\nThis negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line is due to the fact that water has a higher density as a solid compared to a liquid. When pressure increases, the molecules in the solid phase become closer together, increasing the density of the solid phase. This causes the liquid phase to form under high pressure conditions, as the liquid phase has a lower density and is able to exist between the solid and vapor phases.",
