If the silver metal amalgam cannot be used because of concerns about mercury, which of the following would be a reasonable and safe substitute?\n\nA. H+(aq)\nB. Na(s)\nC. Ca2+(aq)\nD. Mg(s)\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will consider the properties of the given options and determine which one would be a reasonable and safe substitute for silver metal amalgam in reducing substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nA. H+(aq) - Hydrogen ions are a component of water, but they are not a metal and do not have the properties required for reducing substances.\n\nB. Na(s) - Sodium is a metal, but it is highly reactive and would likely cause unwanted chemical reactions instead of reducing substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nC. Ca2+(aq) - Calcium is a metal, but it is also highly reactive and would likely cause unwanted chemical reactions instead of reducing substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nD. Mg(s) - Magnesium is a metal, but it is less reactive than silver and would be a reasonable and safe substitute for reducing substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Mg(s).",
