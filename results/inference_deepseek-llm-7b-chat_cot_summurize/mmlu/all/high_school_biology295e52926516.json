Plasma cells\n\nassistant:The rapid recovery from the flu strain in the second time a person gets it can be attributed to the presence of memory cells. Memory cells, also known as long-lived immune cells, are a specialized subset of T cells that remember the pathogen or antigen that they have previously encountered. When the person encounters the same pathogen again, the memory cells quickly recognize and eliminate it, leading to a faster recovery. Helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and plasma cells play important roles in the immune response, but they do not specifically contribute to the rapid recovery experienced in subsequent encounters with the same pathogen.",
