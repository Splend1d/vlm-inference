False, True\n\nStatement 1: The softmax function is commonly used in multiclass logistic regression. This statement is true. The softmax function is used to transform the output of a neural network to a probability distribution over the classes, which is necessary for multiclass classification.\n\nStatement 2: The temperature of a nonuniform softmax distribution affects its entropy. This statement is false. The temperature of a softmax distribution only affects the output of the distribution, not its entropy. The entropy of a softmax distribution is constant for a given temperature, regardless of the input data.",
