I and II only\nD. I and III only\n\nassistant:To determine which of the given statements must also be ideals of R, let's analyze each one:\n\nI. {u + v : u \\in and v \\in V}\nThis set is the set of all sums of elements from U and V. Since U and V are two-sided ideals, for any u \\in U and v \\in V, we have u + v + u' + v' \\in U and V. Therefore, this set is an ideal of R.\n\nII. {uv : u \\in U and v \\in V}\nThis set is the set of all products of elements from U and V. Since U and V are two-sided ideals, for any u \\in U and v \\in V, we have uv + uv' + u'v + u'v' \\in U and V. However, this set is not necessarily an ideal of R, as it depends on the relation between U and V.\n\nIII. {x : x \\in U and x \\in V}\nThis set is the set of all elements that are in both U and V. Since U and V are two-sided ideals, this set is an ideal of R.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that:\n\nI. {u + v : u \\in and v \\in V} and {x : x \\in U and x \\in V} must also be ideals of R.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. I and II only.",
