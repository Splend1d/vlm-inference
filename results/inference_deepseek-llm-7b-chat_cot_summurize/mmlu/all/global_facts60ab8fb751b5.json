However, it is important to note that this figure is based on a global survey and not specifically focused on the question of morality and good values.\n\nIt is also worth noting that India is a diverse and complex country with a wide range of beliefs and values. While a majority of Indians may believe in God, there are also many people who do not share this belief. Additionally, there are many factors that can influence a person's moral values, such as culture, education, and personal experiences.",
