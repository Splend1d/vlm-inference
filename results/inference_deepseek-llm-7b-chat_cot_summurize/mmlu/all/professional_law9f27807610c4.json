Under strict tort liability, a plaintiff does not have to prove that the defendant was negligent, and the defendant is liable for any harm caused by a defective product, regardless of whether the defendant knew or should have known about the defect.\n\nIn this case, the doctor and the hospital provided a product (the defective screws) to the woman that was unreasonably dangerous and caused her harm (the need for a second surgery to replace the defective screws). The fact that the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws does not absolve them of liability for the defect, as they were still responsible for ensuring that the screws were safe for use in surgery.\n\nTherefore, the woman is likely to prevail in her strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital, and may be entitled to compensation for the harm caused by the defective screws.",
