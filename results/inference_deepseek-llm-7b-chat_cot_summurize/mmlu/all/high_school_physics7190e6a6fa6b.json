Assume that the object experiences drag force proportional to speed and that it strikes the ground before reaching terminal sped.\n\nA. It will fall with increasing speed and increasing acceleration.\nB. It will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\nC. It will fall with decreasing speed and increasing acceleration.\nD. It will fall with decreasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. It will fall with increasing speed and increasing acceleration.\n\nWhen an object is in free fall, it experiences a constant drag force proportional to its speed. This means that as the object falls, it will experience an increasing drag force, which will cause its speed to increase. At the same time, the object will also experience a constant acceleration due to gravity, which will cause its speed to increase even further. Therefore, the object will fall with increasing speed and increasing acceleration.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it contradicts the fact that the object's speed is increasing as it falls. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that the object's speed is decreasing, which is not possible in free fall. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the object's acceleration is decreasing, which is not possible in free fall either.",
