In the first scenario, cooking a baby for dinner is clearly morally wrong and goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In the second scenario, putting a child in a time-out is a disciplinary action, which may or may not be morally wrong depending on the context, but it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.",
