Which of the following final states can NOT be reached by an allowed transition?\n\nA. n = 3, l = 2\nB. n = 3, l = 1\nC. n = 3, l = 0\nD. n = 2, l = 0\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's first recall the allowed transitions for an electron in the n = 4, l = 1 state in hydrogen.\n\nFor hydrogen, we have the following allowed transitions:\n1. n = 4, l = 1 to n = 3, l = 1 (\u03c0\u00b9)\n2. n = 4, l = 1 to n = 3, l = 0 (\u03c0\u00b2)\n3. n = 4, l = 1 to n = 4, l = 0 (\u03bd)\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\nA. n = 3, l = 2: This is an allowed transition (\u03c0\u00b2), so it is possible.\n\nB. n = 3, l = 1: This is also an allowed transition (\u03c0\u00b9), so it is possible.\n\nC. n = 3, l = 0: This is an allowed transition (\u03c0\u00b2), so it is possible.\n\nD. n = 2, l = 0: This is not an allowed transition for the given electron state. The allowed states for an electron in the n = 4, l = 1 state are n = 4, l = 0 and n = 3, l = 1, 0. Therefore, this final state cannot be reached by an allowed transition.\n\nSo, the answer is D. n = 2, l = 0.",
