One, two! And through and through\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\nHe went galumphing back.\n\"And hast thou vanquished it?\" cried the King.\n\"Be half of thee wittily gone!\"\n\"Aye, marry,\" said he, \"in mome.\"\n\"But some remain, the vorpal beast did prey;\nSemley, I killed a knight, whom barely breath'd he;\nHe caught him unawares, as he was pricking his staff on ground, and he to him did say,\n'What a powerful instrument this 's! ... I shall have tales to tell:\nWhen the Battle's over-fought, and the King has won,\nI'll set the vorpal sword at the Table round, and say,\n'\"Knights, come! this is the feast of victory,\nAnd I will give you blood!'\"\n\"But some remain, the vorpal beast did prey;\nSemley, I killed a knight, whom barely breath'd he.\"\n\nThe given words are:\nA. brillig\nB. bandersnatch\nC. wabe\nD. grelp\n\nAfter analyzing the poem, I can see that the word \"bandersnatch\" appears in the poem. Therefore, the answer is B. \"bandersnatch\".",
