Promoting improvements in the education of the population.\n\nEconomic growth is primarily driven by innovation, productivity, and skilled labor. Improving the education system can lead to a higher level of skills, knowledge, and innovation among the population, which can, in turn, increase productivity and competitiveness.\n\nA. Imposing tariffs to protect domestic industries from foreign competition may temporarily help some domestic industries, but it can also lead to trade wars, reduced consumer choices, and higher prices for consumers.\n\nB. Placing taxes on savings may discourage saving and investment, which are essential for economic growth.\n\nC. Increasing government spending can have a positive impact on economic growth in the short term, but it can also lead to high levels of public debt and reduce incentives for private investment.",
