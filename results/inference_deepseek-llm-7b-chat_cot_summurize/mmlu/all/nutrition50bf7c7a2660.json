None of the options given is correct.\n\nWhile bariatric surgery can significantly reduce obesity and improve glycemic control, it does not always eliminate the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. In some cases, the surgery may only reduce the incidence by 50%, as stated in option C. However, it is essential to note that the exact reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery varies depending on factors such as the patient's pre-surgery health status, surgical procedure, and post-surgery lifestyle modifications.",
