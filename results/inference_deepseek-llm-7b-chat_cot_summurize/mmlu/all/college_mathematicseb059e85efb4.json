Let W be the subspace of all polynomials p (x) in V such that p (0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. Then dim V + dim W is\n\nA. 4\nB. 5\nC. 6\nD. 7\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the dimension of V. We are given that V is the vector space of real polynomials of degree at most 3. Since a polynomial of degree 3 can be written as a linear combination of monomials of degree 1, 2, and 3, we can write V as a direct sum of three one-dimensional subspaces:\n\nV = span{(1),(x),(x^2),(x^3)}\n\nThe dimension of V is 4, as there are 4 linearly independent monomials.\n\nNow let's find the dimension of W. We are given that W is the subspace of all polynomials p(x) in V such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. To find W, we need to find the linear combination of the monomials in V that satisfies these conditions.\n\np(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0\n\nThe only monomial that satisfies this condition is the monomial x^2, as x^2(0) = x^2(1) = x^2(-1) = 0. Therefore, the dimension of W is 1.\n\nFinally, let's find the dimension of V + W. The dimension of a direct sum of subspaces is the sum of the dimensions of the subspaces. Therefore:\n\ndim(V + W) = dim(V) + dim(W)\ndim(V + W) = 4 + 1\ndim(V + W) = 5\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 5.",
