At trial, the main issue of contention centered on the identity of the burglar. The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges.

This is because the evidence can be considered relevant to the issue of motive, which is a relevant and material fact in determining the defendant's guilt or innocence. However, the jury should be instructed to only consider the evidence for its relevance to the defendant's motive to burglarize, and not to use it for any other purpose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.",
