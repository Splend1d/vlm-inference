What is the upper critical value of z to be used in constructing this interval?\n\nA. 0.9699\nB. 1.96\nC. 1.555\nD. 1.88\n\nassistant:To construct a 94% confidence interval for a population proportion, we can use the following formula:\n\nupper critical value of z = 1 + (z-value)\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-value for a 94% confidence interval. A 94% confidence interval corresponds to a margin of error of 0.02. We can use the following formula to find the z-value:\n\nmargin of error = 1 / sqrt(sample size)\n\nFor a 94% confidence interval, the margin of error is 0.02. To find the sample size, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.02 = 1 / sqrt(sample size)\n\nSolving for the sample size, we get:\n\nsample size = 1 / (0.02 / sqrt(z-value))\n\nsample size = 1 / (0.02 / 1.96)\n\nsample size = 1 / 0.0103\n\nsample size \u2248 97\n\nNow that we have the sample size, we can find the z-value:\n\nz-value = 1 / sqrt(sample size)\n\nz-value = 1 / sqrt(97)\n\nz-value \u2248 1.96\n\nNow that we have the z-value, we can find the upper critical value of z:\n\nupper critical value of z = 1 + z-value\n\nupper critical value of z = 1 + 1.96\n\nupper critical value of z \u2248 2.96\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1.88.",
