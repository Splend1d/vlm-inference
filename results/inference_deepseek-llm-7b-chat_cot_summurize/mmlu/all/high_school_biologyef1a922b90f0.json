Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck\nB. Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck\nC. Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck\nD. Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck.\n\nThis group of individuals held the belief that species are fixed and unchanging. Aristotle, who lived in Ancient Greece, believed that species were immutable and incapable of change. Cuvier, a French anatomist and comparative anatomist, also held the view that species were fixed and unchanging. Lamarck, a French biologist, proposed the idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which was a precursor to the modern theory of evolution by natural selection.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck do not all hold the belief that species are fixed and unchanging. Linnaeus believed in the idea of species as distinct and unchangeable, but Cuvier and Lamarck did not.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck do not all hold the belief that species are fixed and unchanging. Although Linnaeus did believe in the fixity of species, Lyell and Lamarck did not.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier do not all hold the belief that species are fixed and unchanging. Cuvier did hold the belief that species were fixed, but Aristotle and Linnaeus did not.",
