This evidence can include artifacts, which are objects made or used by humans, as well as other types of remains such as buildings, burials, and cultural features.\n\nOption A, artifact, is a general term for any object made or used by humans, and can include items such as tools, weapons, pottery, and jewelry. While artifacts can be found at archaeological sites, they are not the same thing as the site itself.\n\nOption B, sample, is a term used in scientific contexts to refer to a small portion of a larger group or population. It is not applicable to the context of archaeological sites.\n\nOption D, culture, is a term used to describe a group of people who share a common way of life, including their customs, beliefs, and social organization. While archaeological sites can provide information about the culture of the people who lived there, the term culture does not accurately describe an archaeological site itself.",
