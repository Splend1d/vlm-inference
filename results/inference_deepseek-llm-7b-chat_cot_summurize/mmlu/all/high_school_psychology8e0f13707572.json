EEG\nD. fMRI\n\nassistant:A doctor examining a car crash victim in order to determine whether the crash caused structural damage to the brain would use an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scan. This type of brain scan is used to observe changes in blood flow and oxygen levels in the brain, which can indicate areas of increased activity or damage.\n\nAn MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, on the other hand, is primarily used to create detailed images of the brain's structure. A PET (positron emission tomography) scan, which is often used to diagnose various types of cancer and other diseases, provides information about the distribution and metabolism of glucose (a type of sugar) in the brain. An EEG (electroencephalogram) scan, which measures the electrical activity of the brain, is typically used to diagnose conditions such as epilepsy and sleep disorders.",
