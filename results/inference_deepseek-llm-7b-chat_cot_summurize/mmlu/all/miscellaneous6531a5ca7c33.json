Mitosis is a biological process that replicates DNA and divides a cell into two identical daughter cells. The other options are not related to DNA replication:\n\nA. molting: This is a process in which some animals, such as reptiles and birds, shed their outer skin or feathers to grow a new one.\n\nC. diffusion: This is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, due to random movement of particles.\n\nD. peristalsis: This is a series of coordinated muscle contractions that push food along the digestive tract.",
