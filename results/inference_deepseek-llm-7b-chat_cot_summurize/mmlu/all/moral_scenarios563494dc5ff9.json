Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character does something morally wrong by keeping the money from the lost wallet, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In the second scenario, the main character is simply describing an action they took (walking their dogs), which is not morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.",
