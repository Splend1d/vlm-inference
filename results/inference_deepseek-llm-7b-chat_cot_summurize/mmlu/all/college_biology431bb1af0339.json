The embryos of terrestrial vertebrates are encased within a fluid secreted by the chorion, which provides protection and helps to regulate the temperature of the developing embryo. The amnion and allantois are also important structures in the development and protection of embryos, but they do not secrete the fluid themselves. The yolk sac is a structure that provides nutrients to the developing embryo through the yolk it contains.",
