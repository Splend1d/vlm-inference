China was threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads, and early gunpowder weapons with their unwieldiness were of little utility against them. Therefore, the Chinese focused on improving horse archer units, which were more effective against this foe. The passage does not mention Confucian traditionalism, the faith in existing armed forces, or the expense of converting to a new military technology. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",
