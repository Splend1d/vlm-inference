Suppose a doctor prescribes the medicine to four unrelated patients. What is the probability that none of the patients will develop side effects?\n\nA. 0.8\nB. 0.4096\nC. 0.25\nD. 0.2\n\nassistant:To find the probability that none of the four patients will develop side effects, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)\n\nwhere A represents the event that a patient develops side effects and B represents the event that a patient does not develop side effects.\n\nSince the probability of a patient developing side effects is one in five, we can calculate P(A) as follows:\n\nP(A) = (1/5) * 4 = 4/25\n\nNow, we need to find P(B). Since the probability of a patient not developing side effects is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, we can calculate P(B) as follows:\n\nP(B) = (4/5) * 4 = 16/25\n\nNext, we need to find P(A \u2229 B), which represents the probability that both a patient does not develop side effects and another patient does not develop side effects:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(B) * P(B) = (16/25) * (16/25) = 256/625\n\nNow, we can find the probability that none of the patients will develop side effects:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B) = (4/25) + (16/25) - (256/625)\n\nP(A \u222a B) = (20/625) + (16/625) - (256/625) = (46/625) - (256/625) = -210/625\n\nSince the probability cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement or in the calculation.
