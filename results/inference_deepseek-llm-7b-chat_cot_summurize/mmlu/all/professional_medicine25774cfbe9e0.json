The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\nC. The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\nD. The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant\n\nassistant:The most appropriate interpretation of these study results is A. The findings are both clinically and statistically significant. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 0.3 days shorter than for those receiving the placebo (6.4 days vs. 6.7 days), and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.04). This suggests that the new drug may be more effective in reducing the duration of symptoms for people with the common cold.",
