Muscle lactate production increases when glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\n\nLactate is a byproduct of the cellular process called glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose to produce energy for the muscles. When glycolysis is activated during the onset of exercise, the rate of glucose breakdown increases, leading to an increase in lactate production.\n\nOption A is incorrect because oxygen is required for the complete breakdown of glucose to produce energy, but it does not directly relate to lactate production.\n\nOption B is incorrect because pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown, which is a process that occurs during glycolysis.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the pH of the muscle does not directly affect lactate production.",
