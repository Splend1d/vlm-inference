If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\n\nA. 0\nB. 40 m/s down\nC. 80 m/s down\nD. 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down\n\nassistant:Let's denote the velocity of the airplane as V and the velocity of the payload as P. Since the airplane is traveling due north, its velocity is V = 100 m/s north. We are given that air resistance is neglected, so the velocity of the payload relative to the plane (VP) is the difference between the velocities of the airplane and the payload. Therefore, VP = P - V = P - 100 m/s.\n\nNow, we need to find the velocity of the payload relative to the ground. We can do this by subtracting the velocity of the airplane relative to the ground (Vg) from the velocity of the payload relative to the plane (VP). So, P - Vg = VP.\n\nSince the airplane is traveling due north, its velocity relative to the ground is Vg = 100 m/s north. Substituting this into the equation above, we get P - 100 m/s = VP.\n\nNow, we can use the kinematic equation V = Vd/T to find the velocity of the payload (P) when it is released. We know that the airplane is traveling for 4.0 s after releasing the payload, so T = 4.0 s. The distance the airplane travels is 0 since it is parallel to the ground and does not move horizontally. Therefore, V = 0.\n\nSubstituting these values into the kinematic equation, we get 0 = P/4.0 s. Solving for P, we get P = 0 m/s.\n\nNow, we can find VP by substituting P - 100 m/s into the equation P - Vg = VP. We get VP = (0 m/s - 100 m/s) = -100 m/s.\n\nSince we are given that air resistance is neglected, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane after 4.0 s is the negative of the velocity of the airplane relative to the ground, which is -100 m/s = 100 m/s down.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 40 m/s down.",
