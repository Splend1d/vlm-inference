If $h(x)$ is also a polynomial such that $f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $36$, then what is the degree of the polynomial $h$?\n\nA. 72\nB. 6\nC. 18\nD. 12\n\nassistant:Let $p(x) = f(x)$ and $q(x) = g(x)$. We are given that $h(x)$ is a polynomial such that $p(q(x)) + q(h(x)) + h(p(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $36$. \n\nExpanding $p(q(x))$, we get $p(g(x))$. \n\nExpanding $q(h(x))$, we get $q(h(x))$. \n\nExpanding $h(p(x))$, we get $h(f(x))$. \n\nAdding these three terms, we get: \n\n$p(g(x)) + q(h(x)) + h(f(x)) = p(g(x)) + q(h(x)) + h(f(x))$.\n\nSince $p(g(x)) + q(h(x)) + h(f(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $36$, and the sum is equal to $p(g(x)) + q(h(x)) + h(f(x))$, we conclude that the degree of $h$ must be $6$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
