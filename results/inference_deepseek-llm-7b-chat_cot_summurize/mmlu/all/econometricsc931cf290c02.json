(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\ni) Variance decompositions measure the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR. This is true because variance decompositions decompose the overall variance of the VAR into the variances of each individual variable, showing how a unit shock to each variable affects the overall VAR.\n\nii) Variance decompositions can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable. This is also true, as variance decompositions show the contribution of each variable to the overall variance of the VAR.\n\niii) The ordering of the variables is important for calculating impulse responses but not variance decompositions. This is true, as impulse responses provide information about how a VAR responds to changes in one variable, while variance decompositions show the contribution of each variable to the overall variance of the VAR.\n\niv) It is usual that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable. This is a commonly held belief, but it is not necessarily true for all VARs. The contribution of each variable to the overall variance of the VAR depends on the specific structure of the VAR and the correlations between the variables.",
