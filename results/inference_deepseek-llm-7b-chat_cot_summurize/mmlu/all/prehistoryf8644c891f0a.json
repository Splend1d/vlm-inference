The tribe spent most of their time carving beads.\nB. The tribe was involved in an intricate trade network.\nC. The tribe had a complex system of inherited social statuses.\nD.

Grave goods refer to the objects placed with the deceased in a burial, and they can provide insight into the culture, beliefs, and social status of the deceased.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the amount of beads does not necessarily indicate that the tribe spent most of their time carving them.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the presence of grave goods does not necessarily indicate an intricate trade network.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the presence of grave goods does not necessarily indicate a complex system of inherited social statuses.\n\nOption D is correct because the amount of grave goods, including weapons and other valuable items, could indicate that the children were sometimes leaders of the tribe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The children were sometimes leaders of the tribe.",
