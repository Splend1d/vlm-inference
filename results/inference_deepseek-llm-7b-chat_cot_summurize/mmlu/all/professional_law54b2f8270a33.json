The speech and debate clause of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution wholly insulates members of Congress from tort liability for statements made on the floor of Congress. This clause protects members of Congress from being sued for statements they make while speaking on the floor of Congress, as long as they are speaking on matters of public concern. Since the senator's accusation was made on the floor of the Senate, this clause would protect him from liability for the defamation suit brought by the purchasing officer.",
