Neuroticism\nB. Extraversion\nC. Agreeableness\nD. Secondary control\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Neuroticism. High levels of self-care behaviors have been associated with high levels of neuroticism. Neuroticism is one of the five factors of personality, which refers to a tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, and sadness. People with high levels of neuroticism tend to be more self-critical, sensitive to criticism, and have a greater tendency to worry.\n\nSelf-care behaviors, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management techniques, can help reduce negative emotions and improve overall well-being. Therefore, people who engage in high levels of self-care behaviors are likely to have higher levels of neuroticism.",
