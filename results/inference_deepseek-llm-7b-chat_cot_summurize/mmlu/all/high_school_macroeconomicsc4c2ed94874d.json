Both supply and demand shift leftward.\n\nLet me explain why the other options are wrong.\n\nA. Both supply and demand shift rightward: If both supply and demand shift rightward, it means that more sellers enter the market and more buyers are willing to buy. This will increase competition and lower the equilibrium price of corn.\n\nC. Supply shifts to the right; demand shifts to the left: If supply shifts to the right, it means that more corn is available in the market. However, if demand shifts to the left, it means that fewer buyers are willing to buy corn. This will lead to lower prices, but not necessarily an increase in the equilibrium price of corn.\n\nD. Supply shifts to the left; demand shifts to the right: If supply shifts to the left, it means that there is less corn available in the market. However, if demand shifts to the right, it means that more buyers are willing to buy corn. This will increase competition and lead to higher prices, not an increase in the equilibrium price.",
