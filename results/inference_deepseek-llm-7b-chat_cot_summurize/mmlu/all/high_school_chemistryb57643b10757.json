Which of the following will, according to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, increase the amount of N2O4 in a reaction vessel?\n\nA. Decreasing the temperature\nB. Increasing the size of the reaction vessel\nC. Adding a selective catalyst\nD. Making the reaction vessel smaller\n\nassistant:According to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, if the concentration of N2O4 in the reaction vessel decreases, then one way to increase the concentration of N2O4 is to decrease the temperature. This is because a decrease in temperature would slow down the rate of the reaction, and thus increase the concentration of N2O4 in the reaction vessel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Decreasing the temperature.",
