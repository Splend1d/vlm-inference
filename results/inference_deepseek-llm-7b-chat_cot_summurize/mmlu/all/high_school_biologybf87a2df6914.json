The chief cause of genetic variation among human individuals is\n\nA. new mutations that occurred in the preceding generation.\nB. the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction.\nC. genetic drift due to the small size of the population.\nD. geographic variation within the population.\n\nassistant:The chief cause of genetic variation among human individuals is the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction. This occurs because when two individuals with different genetic variations (one from each parent) mate and have offspring, the offspring inherit a combination of their parents' genes. This process of mixing and recombination of genes from both parents leads to a wide range of genetic variations in the offspring, resulting in the genetic diversity observed in human populations.\n\nNew mutations that occurred in the preceding generation can also contribute to genetic variation, but they are not the primary cause. Genetic drift due to the small size of the population can also lead to genetic variation, but it is less common and less predictable than genetic recombination. Geographic variation within the population is a result of genetic variation, but it is not the primary cause of it. Therefore, the correct answer is B. the reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction.",
