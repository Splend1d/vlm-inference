In which representation is there overflow from the addition of the integers 011000 and 011000?\n\nA. Two's complement only\nB. Sign and magnitude and one's complement only\nC. Two's complement and one's complement only\nD. All three representations\n\nassistant:The two's complement representation is the one that overflows from the addition of the integers 011000 and 011000. In a two's complement representation, negative numbers are represented by inverting the least significant bit (LSB). The addition of two signed integers with different signs results in a negative number if the sum of the absolute values of the two numbers is greater than or equal to the number of bits used to represent the negative numbers.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the absolute values of 011000 and 011000 is 111000, which is greater than or equal to 6 bits (assuming a 6-bit number). Therefore, there is overflow from the addition, and the result is represented as a negative number in two's complement representation.\n\nThe answer is A. Two's complement only.",
