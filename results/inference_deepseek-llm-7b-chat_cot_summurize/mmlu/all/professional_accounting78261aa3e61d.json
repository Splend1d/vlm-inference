Costs Variable $3 Fixed 5 What is Duct's target selling price?\n\nA. $18.00\nB. $18.75\nC. $25.00\nD. 33.6\n\nassistant:To determine Duct's target selling price, we can use the following formula:\n\nTarget Selling Price = (Target Contribution Margin / (1 - (Variable Cost Ratio / Total Cost Ratio))) * Total Cost\n\nFirst, let's calculate the unit costs for Duct:\n\nTotal Manufacturing Cost = Variable Manufacturing Cost + Fixed Manufacturing Cost\nTotal Manufacturing Cost = $12 (Variable) + $8 (Fixed) = $20\n\nTotal Selling & Admin. Cost = Variable Selling & Admin. Cost + Fixed Selling & Admin. Cost\nTotal Selling & Admin. Cost = $3 (Variable) + $5 (Fixed) = $8\n\nTotal Cost = Total Manufacturing Cost + Total Selling & Admin. Cost\nTotal Cost = $20 (Manufacturing) + $8 (Selling & Admin.) = $28\n\nNext, let's calculate the unit costs for Duct:\n\nVariable Cost Ratio = Variable Cost / Total Cost\nVariable Cost Ratio = $3 (Variable Selling & Admin.) / $28 (Total Cost) = 0.11\n\nNow, let's calculate the Target Contribution Margin:\n\nTarget Contribution Margin = Target Selling Price - Total Cost\n20% of Total Cost = 0.20 * $28 = $5.60\n\nNow, let's calculate the Target Contribution Margin / (1 - Variable Cost Ratio / Total Cost Ratio):\n\nTarget Contribution Margin / (1 - Variable Cost Ratio) = $5.60 / (1 - 0.11) = $5.60 / 0.89 = $6.21\n\nNow, let's calculate the Total Cost Ratio:\n\nTotal Cost Ratio = 1 / (Variable Cost Ratio + Fixed Cost Ratio)\nTotal Cost Ratio = 1 / (0.11 + 1) = 1 / 1.11 \u2248 0.90\n\nNow, let's calculate the Target Selling Price:\n\nTarget Selling Price = (Target Contribution Margin / (1 - (Variable Cost Ratio / Total Cost Ratio))) * Total Cost\nTarget Selling Price = ($6.21 / (1 - 0.11)) * $28 \u2248 $25.00\n\nSo, the answer is C. $25.00.",
