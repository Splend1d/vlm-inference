Some countries have had relatively significant growth rates.\n\nIn 2020, Sub-Saharan Africa experienced mixed economic growth, with some countries experiencing relatively significant growth rates. According to the World Bank, the region's GDP growth rate was around 3.4% in 2019. However, the growth rate varied across countries, with some experiencing significant growth while others struggled with economic challenges.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the region has not entirely stagnated. While there are still challenges, some countries have made progress in various sectors.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has not become poorer than it initially was in 1980. While the DRC has faced challenges in recent years, such as political instability, conflict, and resource extraction issues, it has also made progress in some areas, including agriculture and manufacturing.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary negative information about the DRC without providing evidence to support it.",
