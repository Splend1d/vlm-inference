GABA\nB. Acetylcholine\nC. Serotonin\nD. Dopamine\n\nassistant:Dopamine is the neurotransmitter most explicitly associated with the experience of pleasure. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in reward and reinforcement learning, and it is released in response to pleasurable stimuli such as food, sex, and drugs. It is also involved in the regulation of motivation, attention, and movement. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter that is associated with mood and well-being, but it is not as directly linked to pleasure as dopamine.",
