The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n\nassistant:C. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nThe owner's agreement with the employee does not affect the mother's right to assign her share of the contract to the nursing home. The anti-assignment clause in the contract only applies to the employee, and does not extend to the mother's right to assign her share of the contract. Therefore, the nursing home has a valid claim for the payment of the mother's share of the contract, and the owner would be liable for breach of contract if they fail to make the required payments.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was not void as violative of the anti-assignment clause. The anti-assignment clause only applies to the employee, not to the mother.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the agreement between the owner and the employee does not reduce the owner's obligations to the nursing home. The owner's obligation to pay the employee's salary does not affect their obligation to pay the nursing home.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was not irrevocable. The mother could revoke the assignment at any time, as long as she did so before the nursing home filed a lawsuit for breach of contract.",
