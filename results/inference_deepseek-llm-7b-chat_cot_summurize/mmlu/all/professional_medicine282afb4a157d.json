DNA purified from the leukocytes of the patient is reacted in a mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. The technician most likely used which of the following laboratory procedures on this patient's blood?\n\nA. Northern blotting\nB. Polymerase chain reaction\nC. Reverse transcription\nD. Southern blotting\n\nassistant:The technician most likely used the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) laboratory procedure on this patient's blood to determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA is present. PCR is a commonly used technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences by using primers and a thermostable DNA polymerase. In this case, the oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA are used as primers, and the thermostable DNA polymerase is used to synthesize new DNA molecules. The repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are necessary to allow for the synthesis of new DNA strands, while the nucleotides provide the building blocks for the DNA synthesis. After the reaction, the resulting DNA product can be detected by gel electrophoresis.\n\nA. Northern blotting is a technique used for detecting RNA molecules in a sample by hybridizing them to a labeled nucleic acid blot.\n\nB. Reverse transcription is a technique used to convert RNA into cDNA, which is then amplified using PCR or other molecular biology techniques.\n\nC. Southern blotting is a technique used for detecting DNA molecules in a sample by hybridizing them to a labeled nucleic acid blot.\n\nD. All of the above.",
