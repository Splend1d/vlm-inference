Helium\nB. Sodium\nC. Uranium\nD. Copper\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first look at the atomic mass of each element and compare them to determine which one has the highest atomic mass.\n\nA. Helium: Atomic mass of Helium is 4.0026 u\nB. Sodium: Atomic mass of Sodium is 22.9898 u\nC. Uranium: Atomic mass of Uranium is 238.022 u\nD. Copper: Atomic mass of Copper is 63.546 u\n\nComparing the atomic masses of the elements, I find that:\n\n- Helium has the lowest atomic mass (4.0026 u)\n- Sodium has the second lowest atomic mass (22.9898 u)\n- Uranium has the highest atomic mass (238.022 u)\n- Copper has the third highest atomic mass (63.546 u)\n\nTherefore, the element with the highest atomic mass is Uranium.",
