The product costs 116.50 pesos to produce and ship to Europe, where the product sells for 20 euros. If 0.1099 U.S. dollars are required to buy one Mexican peso, and 0.8928 U.S. dollars are required to buy one euro, what amount of U.S. dollars is the profit on the sale?\n\nA. $5.06\nB. $6.11\nC. $7.20\nD. $9.60\n\nassistant:To find the profit on the sale, we need to calculate the difference between the product's cost and its selling price in euros, and then convert that amount to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates given in the problem.\n\n1. Convert the cost of the product to U.S. dollars:\nCost in pesos = 116.50 pesos\nExchange rate = 0.1099 USD/MXN\nCost in U.S. dollars = 116.50 * 0.1099 = 13.10 USD\n\n2. Convert the selling price in euros to U.S. dollars:\nSelling price in euros = 20 euros\nExchange rate = 0.8928 USD/euro\nSelling price in U.S. dollars = 20 * 0.8928 = 17.856 USD\n\n3. Calculate the profit:\nProfit = Selling price - Cost\nProfit = 17.856 - 13.10 = 4.756 USD\n\nThe profit on the sale is $4.756 USD, which is not one of the given options.
