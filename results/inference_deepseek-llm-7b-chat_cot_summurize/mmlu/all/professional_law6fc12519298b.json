After 10 years of marriage, the couple began experiencing marital difficulties. In 1992, they separated and the husband moved to another state where his family lived.

This period of adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 10 years. Therefore, the court may rule in favor of the woman and grant her an absolute fee simple ownership of the property, as she has obtained the son's interest by adverse possession.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the son's interest in the property was not acquired through unjust enrichment, but rather through his father's quitclaim deed in 1994.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the son's interest in the property was not acquired through a void quitclaim deed, but rather through his father's deed in 1994.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the deed from the husband to the son was not void for lack of consideration, but rather was a valid quitclaim deed.",
