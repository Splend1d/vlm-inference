According to Rawls' theory, policies should be evaluated based on their impact on the well-being of the least advantaged members of society. Macedo, however, argues that we must also consider the well-being of the most advantaged members of society, as they can also be vulnerable to exploitation by those with more power. This perspective is known as the \"difference principle\" and is a key component of Rawls' theory of justice.",
