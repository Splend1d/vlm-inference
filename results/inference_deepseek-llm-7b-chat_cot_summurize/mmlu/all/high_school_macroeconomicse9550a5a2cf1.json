When the money supply increases, it leads to an increase in spending, which in turn leads to an increase in economic activity. This is because individuals and businesses have more money to spend, which can lead to increased production and employment.\n\nHowever, this is not the only factor at play. There are many other factors that affect spending and economic activity, such as consumer confidence, government policies, and global economic conditions. Therefore, a change in the money supply can impact the economy in several ways, as option B suggests.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while interest rates do change in response to changes in the money supply, they are not the only factor that affects spending. Other factors such as consumer confidence and government policies can also impact spending.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because while there may be some factors that do not change in response to a change in the money supply, it is unlikely that all factors would remain constant. The money supply is a powerful driver of economic activity, and its impact on spending and economic conditions is likely to be significant.",
