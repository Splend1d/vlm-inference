(ii) and (iv) only\nB. (i) and (iii) only\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nExplanation:\n(i) The standard error will be positively related to the residual variance - This is true. The standard error of the slope coefficient is calculated as the standard deviation of the residuals, which is a measure of the dispersion of the observations about the fitted line. Therefore, if the residual variance is high, the standard error will also be high.\n\n(ii) The standard error will be negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value - This is also true. The standard error is used to measure the variability of the coefficient estimate, and the dispersion of the observations about their mean value will increase the standard error.\n\n(iii) The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size - This is true. The standard error decreases with an increase in the sample size, as it is calculated by taking the square root of the sample variance. Therefore, a larger sample size will result in a smaller standard error.\n\n(iv) The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate - This is true. The standard error is a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate, and it indicates how well the estimated coefficient represents the true value. A lower standard error means that the estimate is more precise.\n\nTherefore, all of the statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are true.",
