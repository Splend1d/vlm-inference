After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers.

This is because the President is the one who appointed a delegation to negotiate with foreign representatives, and the treaty they formed is aimed at addressing a specific issue related to foreign relations. Additionally, the treaty-making power is a part of the President's power to conduct foreign affairs. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.",
