When the tenant requested the repainting of the office space on June 1, 2007, and the architect failed to comply, the tenant was within their rights to refuse to pay any further rent.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there was no constructive eviction, as the tenant had not physically removed their belongings or taken possession of the premises.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the tenant did not have the remedy of self-help, as they were still required to pay rent until the lease expired.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the architect's failure to perform the express covenant did not give the tenant the right to self-help and abandon the premises. The obligation to pay rent was dependent on the architect's performance of his express covenant.",
