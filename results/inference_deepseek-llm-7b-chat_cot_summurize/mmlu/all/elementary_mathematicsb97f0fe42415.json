Each right triangle has a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm. What is the total area, in square centimeters, of the shape?\n\nA. 10\nB. 60\nC. 120\nD. 240\n\nassistant:To find the area of the shape, we need to find the area of one right triangle and then multiply it by the total number of triangles.\n\nThe area of one right triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 4 cm * 5 cm = 10 square cm.\n\nSince there are 12 right triangles, we multiply the area of one triangle by the number of triangles: 10 square cm * 12 = 120 square cm.\n\nThe answer is C.",
