However, the police had probable cause to conduct the search, as they had received information that drugs were being shipped to the defendant and had observed the defendant accepting a package containing a suspicious substance.\n\nIn the United States, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, there are exceptions to this protection, such as searches incident to a lawful arrest. In this case, the police had arrested the defendant for illegal possession of cocaine, which gave them the authority to search the vehicle incident to the arrest.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress the introduction of the cocaine into evidence will be denied because the search was incident to a lawful arrest.",
