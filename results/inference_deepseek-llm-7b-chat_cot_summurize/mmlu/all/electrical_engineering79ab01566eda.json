High resistance when forward biased, while low resistance when reverse bias\nD. Low resistance when forward or reverse biased\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. High resistance when forward or reverse biased.\n\nA working diode must have high resistance when either forward or reverse biased. This is because a diode acts as a non-conducting device when reverse biased, which means that it has high resistance. When the diode is forward biased, it allows current to flow in one direction only, making it a one-way conductor. The other options are incorrect because they describe characteristics of a diode that are not necessarily true for a working diode.",
