Yes, as evidence tending to show that the manufacturer was negligent because its initial design failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact.\n\nassistant:The evidence of the manufacturer redesigning the machine after the plaintiff's accident is admissible. This evidence is relevant to show that the manufacturer was aware of the potential risk of the wires coming into contact and caused the machine to turn on, which led to the plaintiff's injury. It can be used to show that the manufacturer's initial design was negligent, as it failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact and causing the machine to turn on.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the manufacturer was negligent because its initial design failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact.",
