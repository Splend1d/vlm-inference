What is the result on the supply and demand for loanable funds?\n\nA. The supply curve would shift up increasing the equilibrium interest rate.\nB. The demand curve would shift up increasing the equilibrium interest rate.\nC. The supply curve would shift down decreasing the equilibrium interest rate.\nD. The demand curve would shift down decreasing the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The supply curve would shift up increasing the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nWhen a financial planner convinces more Americans to save for retirement, it increases the supply of loanable funds in the economy. This means that there is more money available for people to borrow, and as a result, the equilibrium interest rate (the rate at which the market clears) will increase.\n\nThe demand curve would not shift in either direction in this case, as it represents the relationship between the interest rate and the amount of loanable funds that households are willing to borrow. The increase in savings due to the financial planner's advice does not affect households' borrowing decisions, so the demand curve does not change.\n\nTherefore, the other options B, C, and D are incorrect because they suggest that the supply or demand curves would shift in response to the increase in savings, which is not the case. The increase in savings only affects the equilibrium interest rate, not the supply or demand for loanable funds.",
