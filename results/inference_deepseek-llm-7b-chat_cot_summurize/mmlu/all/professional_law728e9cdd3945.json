Prior to her father's death, the woman had already taken over the operations on the father's farm due to his declining health. Recently, the woman had granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the woman a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. After the coal company commenced its strip-mining operations, the woman noticed that the company was not filling in the excavated area as previously agreed. However, because the company paid the woman all the coal royalties from the strip mining, she did not voice any objection regarding its failure to replace the top soil. Two years later, the coal company had now completed its strip-mining operation under its arrangement with the woman. The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property would be an example of a (an)\n\nA. profit-a-prendre.\nB. license.\nC. easement in gross.\nD. voluntary waste.\n\nassistant:The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property can be classified as a (an) A. profit-a-prendre.\n\nA profit-a-prendre is a French term that translates to \"a taking for profit\" in English. It refers to a type of right of possession or occupation of land that allows a person to take or use a certain portion of the land for a specific purpose, such as strip-mining coal. The woman granted the coal company a profit-a-prendre by allowing them to extract the coal from underneath her father's farm, and in exchange, the company agreed to pay the woman a per-ton royalty and to fill in the excavated area and replace the topsoil on the surface of the land.\n\nIn this case, the coal company's right to strip-mine the land is a profit-a-prendre because it involves the company taking possession of a portion of the land for the purpose of extracting the coal, and the woman allowing this use of her property in exchange for payment. This type of right of possession is not the same as a license, easement, or voluntary waste, and is therefore the most appropriate answer to the question.",
