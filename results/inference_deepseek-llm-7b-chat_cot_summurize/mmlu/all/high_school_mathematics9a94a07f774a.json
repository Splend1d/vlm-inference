If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected number of times Bob will roll his die?\n\nA. \\frac{5}{8}\nB. \\frac{1825}{4}\nC. \\frac{5}{4}\nD. 438\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of rolling a prime number on a fair six-sided die:\nThe prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\nThere are 6 possible outcomes on a fair six-sided die.\nSo, the probability of rolling a prime number is 4 out of 6 or 2/3.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of rolling a composite number:\nSince a non-prime number is a composite number, we just need to find the probability of rolling a non-prime number.\nOut of the 4 prime numbers, there is 1 number that is not a prime, which is 4.\nSo, the probability of rolling a composite number is 1 out of 6 or 1/6.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of rolling a 1:\nSince a 1 is not prime or composite, the probability of rolling a 1 is 1 out of 6 or 1/6.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of rolling a 2, 3, 5, or 7:\n(2/3) * (1/6) + (2/3) * (1/6) + (2/3) * (1/6) + (2/3) * (1/6) + (2/3) * (1/6) + (2/3) * (1/6) = 2/3 * (1/6) = 1/9.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of rolling a 4:\n(1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n\nFinally, let's find the expected number of times Bob will roll his die:\nExpected value = (probability of rolling a 1) + (probability of rolling a 2) + (probability of rolling a 3) + ... + (probability of rolling a 6).\nExpected value = (1/6) + (1/6) + (1/6) + (1/6) + (1/6) + (1/6) + (1/9) + (1/36) = 75/54.\n\nSo, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year is 218/54 or 438/108.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 438.",
