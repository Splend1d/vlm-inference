The thalamus acts as a relay center for sensory information, receiving information from the various sensory receptors and transmitting it to the appropriate area of the cerebral cortex for processing and interpretation. The other options listed (hypothalamus, cerebellum, and reticular formation) have different functions in the brain. The hypothalamus is involved in regulating various physiological functions, the cerebellum is involved in motor control and coordination, and the reticular formation is involved in regulating wakefulness and alertness.",
