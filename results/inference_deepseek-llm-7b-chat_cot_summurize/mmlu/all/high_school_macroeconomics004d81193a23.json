Savings deposits\nB. Gold bullion\nC. Cash and coins\nD. 30-year Treasury certificates\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will consider the definition of the M 1 measure of money supply and identify which of the given options are included in that definition.\n\nThe M 1 measure of money supply is a type of monetary aggregate that includes two components: cash in circulation and demand deposits at non-bank financial institutions.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option to determine which components it represents:\n\nA. Savings deposits - This is a type of demand deposit, which is included in the M 1 measure of money supply. So, this is a correct answer.\n\nB. Gold bullion - This is not included in the M 1 measure of money supply because it is not a form of currency that can be easily converted into goods and services.\n\nC. Cash and coins - This is included in the M 1 measure of money supply, but the question asks specifically for a component of the M 1 measure, which is demand deposits. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\nD. 30-year Treasury certificates - This is not included in the M 1 measure of money supply because it is not a form of currency that can be easily converted into goods and services.\n\nBased on my evaluation, the correct answer to the question is A. Savings deposits, as it is a component of the M 1 measure of money supply.",
