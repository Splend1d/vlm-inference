At least three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nII. Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nIII. An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. I and III\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we can construct the Boolean expressions for each condition using the given Boolean variables and connectives.\n\nI. At least three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nThis can be expressed as:\np_1 \u2228 p_2 \u2228 p_3 \u2228 p_4\n\nII. Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nThis can be expressed as:\n(p_1 \u2227 p_2) \u2228 (p_1 \u2227 p_3) \u2228 (p_1 \u2227 p_4) \u2228 (p_2 \u2227 p_3) \u2228 (p_2 \u2227 p_4) \u2228 (p_3 \u2227 p_4)\n\nIII. An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.\nTo express this condition, we can count the number of true variables and check if it is even. If it is even, we can represent it as 1. If it is odd, we can represent it as 0.\n\nSince the question asks for a Boolean formula without the use of \u00ac, we can express the even/odd conditions using the connectives \u2227 and \u2228 as follows:\n\np_1 \u2227 (p_2 \u2228 p_3 \u2228 p_4) \u2228 (p_2 \u2227 p_3) \u2228 (p_3 \u2227 p_4) \u2228 (p_4 \u2227 p_1)\n\nNow we can analyze the expression for each condition:\n\nI. p_1 \u2228 p_2 \u2228 p_3 \u2228 p_4\nII. (p_1 \u2227 p_2) \u2228 (p_1 \u2227 p_3) \u2228 (p_1 \u2227 p_4) \u2228 (p_2 \u2227 p_3) \u2228 (p_2 \u2227 p_4) \u2228 (p_3 \u2227 p_4)\nIII. p_1 \u2227 (p_2 \u2228 p_3 \u2228 p_4) \u2228 (p_2 \u2227 p_3) \u2228 (p_3 \u2227 p_4) \u2228 (p_4 \u2227 p_1)\n\nComparing the expressions, we can see that only condition I is satisfied by the given expression.
