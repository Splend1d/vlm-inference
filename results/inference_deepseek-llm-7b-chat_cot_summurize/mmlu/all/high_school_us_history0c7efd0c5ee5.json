This act was controversial because it allowed for the capture and return of runaway slaves to their owners, even if they had reached a free state.\n\nThe passage you provided does not mention any of the other options. It does not state that slaves could be both citizens and property, nor does it mention any exemption from federal laws. The passage also does not suggest that a solution to the problems of slavery was postponed.\n\nThe correct answer is A, because it accurately describes the main purpose of the Fugitive Slave Act, which was to protect the institution of slavery in the United States.",
