That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era\n\nassistant:The first passage tends to support the idea that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era. It mentions that the Bahr insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive. This suggests that the idea of jihad was considered a serious obligation by Muslim authorities during this time.\n\nOption A is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention the majority of Muslims. Option B is not supported either, as the passage does not discuss Muslim protection of their own territory. Option C is not supported, as it does not suggest that Muslims were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.",
