Self-executing rely on implementing measures stipulated in the treaty Itself\nD. Self-executing treaties follow the doctrine of transformation\n\nassistant:Self-executing treaties refer to those agreements or treaties that contain the necessary provisions to create legal obligations and rights directly, without the need for any further implementing measures. In other words, they are self-executing because they establish their own rules and procedures for implementation and enforcement.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer would be B. Self-executive treaties are clear and precise enough so as not to require any further implementing measures. This means that the terms and conditions of the treaty are clear and well-defined, allowing the parties involved to understand and implement them without the need for additional legal provisions.\n\nThis concept is important in international law, as it simplifies the process of implementing and enforcing treaties by ensuring that they are self-contained and self-executing.",
