The divisors of a positive integer $n$ are its positive factors.\n2. The product of the divisors of $n$ is the same as the prime factorization of $n$.\n3. The number of divisors of $n$ is equal to the product of its exponents in prime factorization.\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$.\n\nLet's first consider the prime factorization of $n^6$.\n\nSince $n > 1$, the prime factorization of $n^6$ will have at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3. Let $n = 2^a \\cdot 3^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of the divisors of $n$.\n\nThe number of divisors of $n$ is $(a + 1)(b + 1)$. The product of the divisors of $n$ is then $(2^a \\cdot 3^b)^6 = (2^{6a} \\cdot 3^{12b})^6$.\n\nWe want this product to be equal to $n^6 = (2^a \\cdot 3^b)^6$.\n\nNow let's consider the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this condition.\n\nWe can start by setting $a = 1$ and $b = 1$, so $n = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. The product of the divisors of 6 is $(2^1 \\cdot 3^1)^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^6 = 64$. This is not equal to $n^6$, so we need to increase the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nLet's try $a = 2$ and $b = 1$, so $n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 = 12$. The product of the divisors of 12 is $(2^2 \\cdot 3^1)^6 = 2^12 \\cdot 3^6 = 2048$, which is still not equal to $n^6$.\n\nLet's try $a = 3$ and $b = 1$, so $n = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 = 24$. The product of the divisors of 24 is $(2^3 \\cdot 3^1)^6 = 2^18 \\cdot 3^12 = 60^6$, which is not equal to $n^6$.\n\nNow, let's try $a = 4$ and $b = 2$, so $n = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 = 48$. The product of the divisors of 48 is $(2^4 \\cdot 3^2)^6 = 2^96 \\cdot 3^{144} = 2^64 \\cdot 3^64$, which is not equal to $n^6$.\n\nFinally, let's try $a = 5$ and $b = 2$, so $n = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 = 32$. The product of the divisors of 32 is $(2^5 \\cdot 3^2)^6 = 2^120 \\cdot 3^{240} = 2^64 \\cdot 3^64$, which is equal to $n^6$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$ is $n = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 = 32$, which corresponds to answer choice D.",
