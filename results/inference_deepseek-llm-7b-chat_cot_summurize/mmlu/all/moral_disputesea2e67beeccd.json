These agreements are typically based on the idea that individuals have certain rights and freedoms that must be protected in order for society to function properly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because social contract theories do not depend on the moral deliberations of a social leader. Instead, they are based on the collective agreement of all individuals in society.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a contract that has been signed by most of the affected parties does not necessarily result in moral rules or principles. A contract is a legal agreement between two or more parties, while social contract theories of morality are concerned with moral rules or principles that apply to all individuals in society.\n\nOption D is incorrect because social contract theories of morality do involve a social agreement of some sort.",
