Damages for personal injuries cannot be recovered in a contract action. This is because the contract between the woman and the handyman was for the construction of a fence, not for the provision of any personal injury protection. The neighbor's injuries were an unforeseen consequence of the handyman's failure to properly reinforce the fence, and therefore not within the scope of the contract.",
