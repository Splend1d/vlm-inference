Many believed that the new scientific discoveries would allow humans to solve all problems.\n\nassistant:The ideas expressed by Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason, as quoted in the question, best illustrate characteristic C. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational person. Paine's belief in one God, his rejection of all national institutions of churches, and his belief that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy all point to his atheism. He also states that he trusts he never shall use any other weapon against errors of every kind, implying that he does not believe in the use of religious beliefs or systems to guide one's life.\n\nWhile Paine does mention reason as the most formidable weapon against errors of every kind, this does not necessarily mean that he believed in the new scientific discoveries as a way to solve all problems. In fact, Paine's statement that \"All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit\" suggests that he did not believe that science or any other single discipline could provide all the answers to life's problems.\n\nWhile some Enlightenment intellectuals, like Paine, did utilize new methods of communicating their ideas, such as inexpensive printed pamphlets, this characteristic does not necessarily apply to all Enlightenment intellectuals. Moreover, many Enlightenment intellectuals, like Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin, were accomplished scientists who made important contributions to human understanding of the universe. Lastly, while some Enlightenment intellectuals, like Voltaire, did reject religion altogether, this characteristic does not necessarily apply to all Enlightenment intellectuals.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideas expressed by Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason, as quoted in the question, best illustrate characteristic C. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational person.",
