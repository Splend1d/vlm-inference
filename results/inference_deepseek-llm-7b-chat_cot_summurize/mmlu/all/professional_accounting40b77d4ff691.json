Management\u2019s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently.\n\nAn auditor of a nonissuer should design tests of details to ensure that sufficient audit evidence supports management's assertions about the existence and efficiency of internal controls. The auditor should also assess the effectiveness of internal controls, which corresponds to answer choice C. However, the auditor does not need to assess the planned level of control risk or the level of assurance at the relevant assertion level, which corresponds to answers A and D, respectively.",
