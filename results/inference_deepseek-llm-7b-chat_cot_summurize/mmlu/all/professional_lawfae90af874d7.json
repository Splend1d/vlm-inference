The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000.

No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\nB. No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.\nC.

Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\n\nUnder California law, a contract may be unenforceable if it was procured by fraud, coercion, or undue influence. In this case, the mechanic unlawfully demanded an additional $2,000 as a condition for delivering the truck, which the landscaper was forced to agree to in order to fulfill its contractual obligations. This constitutes a wrongful threat, and the contract modified as a result would be unenforceable.",
