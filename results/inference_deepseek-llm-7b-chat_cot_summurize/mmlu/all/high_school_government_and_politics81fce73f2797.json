Wade majority opinion was based on the concept of a right to privacy, which was implied by the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose an abortion before fetal viability, which is usually around 24 weeks of pregnancy. This ruling was based on the idea that certain rights, such as the right to privacy, are inherent and not explicitly stated in the Constitution.",
