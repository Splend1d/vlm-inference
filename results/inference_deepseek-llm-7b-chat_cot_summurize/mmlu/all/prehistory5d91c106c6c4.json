The age of the earliest New World sites\n\nassistant:Anthropologists do not need to know when the Bering Strait was exposed and open for travel in order to determine when people entered the Americas from Siberia. This is because the Bering Strait has been open for travel throughout much of the year since the last ice age, making it a feasible route for migration. On the other hand, knowing the age of the earliest New World sites and when eastern Siberia was first inhabited can be useful for understanding the timing and sequence of human migration. The domestication of sled dogs is not directly relevant to the question of when people entered the Americas from Siberia.",
