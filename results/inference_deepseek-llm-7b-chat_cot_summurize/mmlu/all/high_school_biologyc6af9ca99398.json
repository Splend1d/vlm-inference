Safety warnings for acetone include the statement that it is an eye and skin irritant and has flammable vapors.

Wearing leather gloves and covering the nose and mouth with a particle mask\nD. Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed.\n\nAcetone is a flammable vapor, so it is important for the students to take precautions to prevent it from catching fire. Nitrile gloves can provide a barrier between the students' skin and the acetone, reducing the risk of skin irritation. Wearing goggles can protect the students' eyes from any splashing acetone or chemical reactions that may occur during the exercise. Keeping all acetone containers closed can prevent spills and reduce the risk of fire.\n\nWhile options B and C may seem like good safety precautions, they are not as effective in preventing the risks associated with acetone. Placing the chamber in a closed, darkened cabinet for the duration of the pigment separation does not address the flammable vapors or skin and eye irritation risks. Wearing leather gloves and covering the nose and mouth with a particle mask may help protect the students from skin and eye irritation, but it does not address the potential fire hazard associated with acetone.",
