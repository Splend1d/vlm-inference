The purchaser paid the property taxes but she failed to record the deed. She remained in open possession of the property. The original owner then attempted to sell the property five years later to another purchaser who did not know of the prior conveyance.

The second purchaser wins because the first purchaser had to record her deed within five years in order to make it legal in a race-notice jurisdiction.\n\nassistant:The second purchaser will prevail because he recorded his deed first. In a race-notice jurisdiction, a purchaser who records a deed before the original owner re-enters the property is considered to have notice of the original owner's interest and is protected from any claims by the original owner. In this case, the second purchaser recorded his deed before the first purchaser's deed was recorded, so he is entitled to the title to the property.\n\nA. The first purchaser did not have notice of the second purchaser's interest because she did not perform a title search and did not check the public records for deeds.\nC. The tax lien certificate does not give the first purchaser title to the property, only the right to collect the property taxes.\nD. The race-notice rule does not require the first purchaser to record her deed within a certain time period, only that she record it before the second purchaser does.",
