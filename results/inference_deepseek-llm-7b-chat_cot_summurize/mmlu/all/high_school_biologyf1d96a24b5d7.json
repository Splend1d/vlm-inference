By increasing genetic variation of the bacteria\nD. By selecting for viruses better able to infect bacteria\n\nassistant:Viral transduction plays a role in bacterial evolution by increasing genetic variation of the bacteria. In this process, a virus carries bacterial DNA from one bacterial cell to another, which can lead to the integration of the transferred DNA into the host cell's genome. This can result in the production of new proteins and traits that were not present in the original bacterial cell. Over time, this can lead to a greater diversity of bacterial species, as well as the potential for the development of new bacterial strains and adaptations. Therefore, the correct answer is C. By increasing genetic variation of the bacteria.",
