Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\n\nThe court will likely allow Cooper to use portions of March's deposition at trial, as long as he does not use the entire deposition without the court's permission. This is because the deposition is relevant to Cooper's case, and it would not be fair to prevent him from using it. However, if requested by the court, Cooper must read all parts of the deposition that are relevant to the part he is introducing. This is to ensure that the jury hears the full context of the statement and can make an informed decision.",
