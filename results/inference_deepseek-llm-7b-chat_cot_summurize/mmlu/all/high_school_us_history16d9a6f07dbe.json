The bombing of Nagasaki\n\nassistant:The most immediate consequence of the events described in the excerpt above was the internment of Japanese-Americans. This was a response to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan, which led to heightened anti-Japanese sentiment and the need for security measures to protect the United States from potential Japanese aggression. The internment of Japanese-Americans began shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor and lasted for several years. The other options, trade embargoes with Japan (option A), the Battle of Normandy (option B), and the bombing of Nagasaki (option D), all occurred later in the war and were not immediate consequences of the Pearl Harbor attack.",
