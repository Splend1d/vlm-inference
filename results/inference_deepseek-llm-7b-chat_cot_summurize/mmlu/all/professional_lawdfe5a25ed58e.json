The fact that the label is self-authenticating does not necessarily mean that it is the best evidence of the company's involvement in the production of the can.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while the label is self-authenticating, it does not necessarily mean that it is the best evidence of the company's involvement in the production of the can.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is other corroborating evidence presented by the shopper, such as the mouse in the can, which would be sufficient to prove that the can was produced by the company.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the shopper's proper cause of action is indeed strict liability, as the company may be liable for any defects in the can, including the presence of a decomposed mouse.",
