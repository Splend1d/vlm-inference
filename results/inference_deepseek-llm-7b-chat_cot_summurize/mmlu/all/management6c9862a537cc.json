Analyze the given text to understand the context and identify keywords.\n2. Search for the keywords in the provided options.\n3. Find the most relevant option that matches the context of the text.\n\nStep 1: Analyzing the text, I understand that it is a statement about a position on the relationship between planning and performance.\n\nStep 2: Searching for the keywords \"planning\" and \"performance\" in the options, I find that options A, B, and C mention these keywords in their names or descriptions. However, option D, Henry Mintzberg, does not mention these keywords directly.\n\nStep 3: Comparing the relevance of the options, I find that option A, Michael Porter, is the most relevant to the statement as it is about business strategy, which includes planning. Milton Friedman and Gary Hamel are about business strategies as well, but not specifically planning. Henry Mintzberg is about management, but not specifically planning or performance.\n\nTherefore, the position held by the person who made the statement is Michael Porter.",
