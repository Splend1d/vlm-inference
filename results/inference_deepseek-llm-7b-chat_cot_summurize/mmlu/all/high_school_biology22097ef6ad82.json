Desert\nB. Tundra\nC. Taiga\nD. Deciduous forests\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Tundra. In the tundra biome, the permafrost prevents plants from growing deep roots, as the ground remains frozen for most of the year. The desert and deciduous forests do not have permafrost, while the taiga has a layer of permafrost, but not as widespread as in the tundra.",
