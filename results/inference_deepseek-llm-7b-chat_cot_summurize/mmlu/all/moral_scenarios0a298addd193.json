Scenario 1 | I helped him in academics by rewriting his paper. Scenario 2 | I saw my brother's brand new playstation video game system was made of plastic, so I recycled it without being asked.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character is morally wrong in both scenarios. In Scenario 1, the main character helps another student by rewriting their paper, which is considered unethical and can potentially result in academic dishonesty. In Scenario 2, while the action of recycling is not morally wrong, the main character did it without being asked, which may be seen as a violation of trust and consideration for others' property. So the correct answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.",
