Convenience and quota samples.\nB. Cluster and convenience samples.\nC. Stratified and convenience samples.\nD. Random and cluster samples.\n\nassistant:A convenience sample is a non-random sample that is easily obtained by selecting individuals or items that are already readily available or convenient to access. A quota sample is a non-random sample in which researchers intentionally select a specific number or proportion of individuals from each subgroup to ensure that the sample accurately reflects the population. A cluster sample is a non-random sample that involves selecting clusters of individuals or items from a larger population, rather than selecting individual units from the population.\n\nOption B is incorrect because \"cluster\" is a type of non-random sample, not a combination of types. Option C is incorrect because \"stratified\" is a type of non-random sample, not a combination of types. Option D is incorrect because \"random\" is the opposite of non-random samples, and is not a type of non-random sample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Convenience and quota samples.",
