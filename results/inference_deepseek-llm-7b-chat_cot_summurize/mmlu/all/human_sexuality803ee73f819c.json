Prostaglandins are a type of hormone that causes the cervix to soften, dilate, and efface, allowing the baby to pass through the birth canal during labor. The hormones secreted by the Mother's ovaries (A) and the Mother's hypothalamus (B) also play a role in the onset of labor, but it is the prostaglandins that initiate the process. The fetus' adrenal gland (C) does not play a role in the onset of labor.",
