The provision is likely to be declared constitutional, either because it promotes a compelling state interest (option C) or because it does not trigger strict scrutiny (option D).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the provision does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The clause prohibits the government from denying someone equal protection of the laws based on their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In this case, the provision is based on age and residency, which are not listed as protected classes under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOption B is also incorrect. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2 protects citizens from having their privileges or immunities taken away by another state. However, this clause only applies to citizens, not non-citizens like the student in this case. Therefore, the clause does not apply.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the provision does trigger strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny is used to evaluate laws that have a significant impact on a protected class of people. In this case, the provision has a significant impact on out-of-state students, who are a protected class under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the provision must pass strict scrutiny to be constitutional.\n\nOption C is correct. The provision likely promotes a compelling state interest because it helps to fund the state university. The fee differential for out-of-state students helps to offset the costs of educating those students and allows the university to provide a high-quality education to all students. Therefore, the provision is likely to be declared constitutional based on the compelling state interest it promotes.",
