On that same day, the firm contracted with a supplier for a March 15 delivery to the bridge site of the only available replacement gear. The supplier did not know about the early-completion incentive- pay provision in the firm's contract. The supplier misdirected the delivery of the gear, and the firm did not receive it until March 20. The work on the bridge was completed on March 21. But for the late delivery of the gear, the firm would have completed the bridge repair on March 16.

Yes, because the supplier is liable for all damages flowing directly from its breach.\n\nThe supplier's breach of contract directly resulted in the firm not receiving the early completion incentive payment from the municipality. Therefore, the firm should be permitted to recover the $5,000 as part of its damages. The supplier's lack of knowledge of the early-completion incentive provision does not absolve them of responsibility for the consequences of their actions.",
