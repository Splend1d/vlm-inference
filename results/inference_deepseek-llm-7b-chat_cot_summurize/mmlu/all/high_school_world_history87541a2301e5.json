Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n\nassistant:The long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s was Russia benefiting by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\n\nThe text mentions that once-hostile peoples lived together in peace within the Mongol khans' domains, and the law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. This led to an important new stage in international contact, which allowed for secure trade routes and the spread of ideas, inventions, and foods between different civilizations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text does not mention that Russia was excluded from Western European developments like the Renaissance.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the text does not mention that Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the text does not mention that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because the text states that the Mongol khans' domains included most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and that these domains served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. This suggests that Russia benefited from being part of this vast and diverse political entity, which would have allowed for increased cultural exchange and the spread of ideas and innovations.",
