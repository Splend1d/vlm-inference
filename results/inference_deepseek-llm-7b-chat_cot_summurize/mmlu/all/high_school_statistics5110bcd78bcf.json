It is known that the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures. Which of the following is an appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation, and why?\n\nA.

Simple random sample, because this is the only method that gives unbiased results\n\nassistant:A stratified sample is the appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation. \n\nStratified sampling is a technique that divides the population into distinct subgroups or strata based on a specific variable of interest. In this case, the variable of interest is the country of the company's offices. By stratifying the sample based on the country, the researcher can ensure that the views of employees from different countries are well-represented in the sample, thus reducing bias.\n\nWhile simple random sampling is a common and simple method, it does not account for the variation in opinions among different countries. A simple random sample would only include employees from one country, and the results would not accurately represent the views of employees across different countries.\n\nCluster sampling is another method that could be used, but it requires defining the geographical boundaries of the clusters. In this case, the locations of the offices are known, so clustering based on country would be feasible.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to use a stratified sample, as it ensures that the views of employees from different countries are well-represented in the sample, and thus reduces bias in the results.\n\nTo answer the user's question, the appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation is a stratified sample because it allows the researcher to divide the population into distinct strata based on the country of the company's offices, thus ensuring that the views of employees from different countries are well-represented in the sample and reducing bias.",
