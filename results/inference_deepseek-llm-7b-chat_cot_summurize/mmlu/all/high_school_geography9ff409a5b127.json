Gravity concept\nB. Distance decay\nC. Complementarity\nD. Movement bias\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze the given information and evaluate each concept to determine which one best fits the situation.\n\nA. Gravity concept: The gravity concept refers to the idea that customers will naturally be drawn to new stores opening near existing stores, restaurants, or other popular attractions. This concept assumes that there is a positive relationship between the number of stores in a specific area and the likelihood of customers visiting those stores.\n\nB. Distance decay: The distance decay concept suggests that as the distance between a new store and existing stores increases, the likelihood of customers visiting the new store decreases. This concept assumes that customers are more likely to visit stores that are closer to their homes or workplaces.\n\nC. Complementarity: The complementarity concept suggests that new stores opening around a large shopping mall can offer complementary products or services to existing stores. This concept assumes that customers will be attracted to the new stores because they offer a unique product or service that is not available at the existing stores.\n\nD. Movement bias: The movement bias concept suggests that the opening of new stores around a large shopping mall will attract customers who are already moving in that area. This concept assumes that customers who are moving to a new area will be more likely to visit new stores that are already established in that area.\n\nBased on the analysis of these concepts, I conclude that the best answer to the question is:\n\nB.
