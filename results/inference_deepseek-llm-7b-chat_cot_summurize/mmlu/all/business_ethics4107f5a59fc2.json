Interest, Certain, Speculative, Intangible assets\nB. Interest, Uncertain, Assured, Intangible assets\nC. Interest, Uncertain, Speculative, Tangible assets\nD. Interest, Certain, Assured, Tangible assets\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Interest, Certain, Speculative, Intangible assets.\n\nIslamic finance and conventional finance have some key differences. One of the main differences is that Islamic finance prohibits charging and paying interest, which is called \"Riba\" in Islamic finance. Riba is considered usury and is considered sinful in Islamic teachings. This means that Islamic financial products cannot involve the payment or receipt of interest, and must instead use alternative methods of profit-sharing or risk-sharing.\n\nAnother difference is that Islamic finance prohibits certain types of transactions, such as transactions related to gambling, alcohol, and pork products. This is because these activities are considered sinful in Islamic teachings, and Islamic finance seeks to avoid any involvement in such activities.\n\nIn addition, Islamic finance prohibits investment in sinful activities, such as weapons or pornography. This is because Islamic finance seeks to promote ethical and socially responsible investment.\n\nFinally, all financial products in Islamic finance must be backed by tangible assets, which means that the value of the financial product must be derived from a physical asset, such as property or a commodity. This is in contrast to conventional finance, where financial products can be backed by intangible assets such as stocks or bonds.",
