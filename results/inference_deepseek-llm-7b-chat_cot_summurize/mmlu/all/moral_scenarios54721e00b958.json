Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character commits a minor offense (littering), which is generally considered morally wrong. However, it is not a significant or clearly morally wrong action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character commits a more significant action (stealing someone's work) that is clearly morally wrong. However, it is not the main character's fault in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, as the first scenario is wrong, but the second scenario is not wrong.",
