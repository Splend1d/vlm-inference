Currying cannot be applied to functions of more than two arguments.\n\nCurrying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions with a single argument, where the sequence of functions can be composed to produce the original result. However, it is not possible to curry functions with more than two arguments, as each additional argument would require a separate function in the sequence, which would result in an infinite number of functions. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the limitations of currying. Currying can be applied to any function, regardless of the number of arguments, and it can also be applied to functions that return functions as arguments. Additionally, there are no restrictions on the types of arguments that functions with arguments that are functions can have.",
