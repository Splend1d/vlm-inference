Create a contract which is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time.\n\nassistant:Donna's statement creates a unilateral contract. In a unilateral contract, one party (in this case, Donna) promises to perform an action or obligation in exchange for a reward or payment from another party (in this case, Sarah). In this scenario, Donna promises to reveal the identity of the thief if she is paid the $20 in advance by Sarah. This is different from a bilateral contract, which involves mutual agreement between both parties to fulfill certain obligations, and a contract that creates no contract at all. The fact that the contract is dependent on Donna's disclosure within a reasonable period of time makes it a defeasible contract.",
