A young associate was leaving his office for the day when he was stopped by the defendant, who asked him to open his briefcase. The senior associate explained that some files from the law office had been stolen. Startled, the young associate refused to permit the senior associate to look in his briefcase. The young associate said that he had personal papers in his briefcase and he didn't want the senior associate to see them. Having his suspicions aroused, the senior associate raised his clenched fist and exclaimed, \"If you don't hand over that briefcase, I'm going to punch you in the mouth. \" The young associate, who, unknown to the senior associate, suffered from a serious heart condition, had a seizure and died as a result of fright produced by the threatened attack. Which of the following is the most serious crime for which the senior associate should be found guilty?\n\nA. Assault.\nB. Voluntary manslaught\u00c3\u00a7r.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter.\nD. Murder.\n\nassistant:The senior associate should be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. This is because the young associate died as a result of fright produced by the threatened attack, and the senior associate did not intend to cause the young associate's death. The act of threatening the young associate with physical violence was a direct cause of his death, but the senior associate did not intend to kill him. Therefore, involuntary manslaughter is the most appropriate charge. Assault and voluntary manslaughter are not as severe as involuntary manslaughter, as they involve a higher degree of intent, and murder is the most serious crime, which involves premeditated and intentional killing.",
