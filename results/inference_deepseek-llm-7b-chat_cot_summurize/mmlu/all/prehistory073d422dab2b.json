X-ray fluorescence and paleomagnetic dating\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. luminescence dating and optically stimulated luminescence.\n\nLuminescence dating is a type of dating technique that measures the amount of energy trapped in materials that have been heated at archaeological sites. This method uses the fact that certain minerals and rocks contain small amounts of radioactive isotopes, such as uranium and potassium, which emit energy in the form of beta particles and alpha particles, respectively. When these isotopes are heated, they emit energy in the form of light, which can be measured and used to determine the age of the material.\n\nOptically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is a specific type of luminescence dating that uses the natural decay of electrons to measure the amount of energy trapped in materials. OSL dating can be used to date materials such as soil, rock, and ice, and can provide accurate ages for materials up to about 100,000 years old.",
