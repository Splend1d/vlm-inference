Invalid. Counterexample when N is true and M is false\n\nassistant:To construct the truth table for the given argument, we need to assign values to M and N, and then represent the truth values for each combination of M and N.\n\nThere are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations of M and N values:\n\n1. (M, N) = (True, True)\n2. (M, N) = (True, False)\n3. (M, N) = (False, True)\n4. (M, N) = (False, False)\n\nNow, let's fill in the truth values for each row in the truth table:\n\n| M | N | ~(M \u2261 ~N) | M / N |\n|---|---|-----------|-------|\n| True | True | False     | T      |\n| True | False | True      | False  |\n| False | True | True      | False  |\n| False | False | True      | True   |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table:\n\n- The value of ~(M \u2261 ~N) is False when M and N are both True, and True when either M or N, or both, are False.\n- The value of M / N is True when ~(M \u2261 ~N) is True, and False when ~(M \u2261 ~N) is False.\n\nThe argument ~(M \u2261 ~N) is valid, as it holds true in all cases.\n\nHowever, the question asks for a counterexample. A counterexample is a specific example that disproves a general statement. In this case, we need to find a specific case where ~(M \u2261 ~N) is True, but M / N is not True.\n\nLet's try the following counterexample:\n\n(M, N) = (True, False)\n\nIn this case, ~(M \u2261 ~N) is True (since M is True and N is False), but M / N is False (since the argument is not valid for this specific case).\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.
