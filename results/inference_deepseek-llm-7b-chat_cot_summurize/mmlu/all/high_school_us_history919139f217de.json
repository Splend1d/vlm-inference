The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\nC. Populist agitation in the West\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n\nassistant:Coolidge's speech, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" was given on June 30, 1924, during his tenure as the 30th President of the United States. In this speech, he criticizes the government's taxation policies, stating that they are not required by \"urgent necessity and sound public policy.\" He emphasizes that a government that imposes taxes on the people without these justifications is not a protector of liberty but an instrument of tyranny. Coolidge further argues that the first sign of the breaking down of free government is a disregard for the right of the people to their own property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. He emphasizes that without the \"reasonable security in the possession of their property,\" freedom is at an end.\n\nConsidering this context, it is clear that Coolidge is reacting against the governmental policies of the Progressive Era. The Progressive Era was a period of American history that spanned from the late 19th century to the 1920s. This era was marked by significant social, political, and economic changes, with governments playing a more active role in regulating and controlling various aspects of society.\n\nDuring this time, there was a significant push for progressive reforms, which included the establishment of regulatory agencies, the implementation of progressive taxation, and the expansion of social welfare programs. Coolidge's criticism of these policies can be seen as a reaction against the growing government intervention in the economy and the taxation policies that he believed were detrimental to the people's property rights and freedom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is option D, The governmental policies of the Progressive Era.",
