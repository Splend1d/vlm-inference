True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1 is true. Support vector machines (SVMs) are a powerful tool for learning decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces, and they have been shown to achieve the lowest generalization error among all linear classifiers. This is because SVMs use a technique called support vector method to find the optimal decision boundary that separates the two classes with the highest margin. This margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data point, and it ensures that the decision boundary is robust to outliers.\n\nStatement 2 is false. While SVMs with a polynomial kernel can approximate any decision boundary that we get from a generative model with class-conditional Gaussian distributions, the degree of the polynomial kernel must be less than or equal to three. This means that SVMs with a polynomial kernel of degree three or higher cannot perfectly reproduce the decision boundary of a generative model with class-conditional Gaussian distributions.",
