A and B\n\nassistant:A source of organic molecules is not an essential requirement for life as we know it. While oxygen is essential for many organisms to breathe and make energy, and sunlight and photosynthesis are necessary for producing organic molecules, there are other ways for organisms to obtain energy and produce organic molecules. For example, some organisms can break down inorganic molecules like hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce organic molecules.",
