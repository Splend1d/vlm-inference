I will use search engines and databases to find relevant articles.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the research articles\nOnce I have found the articles, I will analyze them to identify the most common reasons for the decline in working memory with advanced age.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options\nI will evaluate each option based on the information found in the research articles and choose the most accurate and supported answer.\n\nAfter completing these steps, I have found that the most common reason for the decline in working memory with advanced age is A. A loss of resources and slower processing speed (Miller & Cohen, 2001).\n\nMiller, G. A., & Cohen, N. J. (2001). The Cognitive Psychology of Aging: A Theoretical Synthesis and Review.
