Thylakoid membrane, inner membrane, outer membrane\nB. Inner membrane, outer membrane, thylakoid membrane\nC. Outer membrane, inner membrane, thylakoid membrane\nD. Strama, outer membrane, inner membrane\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Inner membrane, outer membrane, thylakoid membrane.\n\nThe chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells that are responsible for photosynthesis. The membranes of the chloroplasts can be divided into three main layers: the thylakoid membrane, the inner membrane, and the outer membrane.\n\nThe thylakoid membrane is the innermost layer, which forms a network of flattened sacs called thylakoids. These are where photosynthesis takes place. The inner membrane is the next layer, which is continuous with the thylakoid membrane and is studded with protein complexes. The outer membrane is the outermost layer, which surrounds the entire chloroplast and is continuous with the envelope of the cell.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the membranes of the chloroplast is inner membrane, outer membrane, and thylakoid membrane.",
