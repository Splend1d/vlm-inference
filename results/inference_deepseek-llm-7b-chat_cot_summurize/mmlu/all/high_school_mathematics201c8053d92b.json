We need to find the number of different possible values that can result when their sum is added to their product.\n\nLet's consider the possible pairs of numbers that can be formed:\n\n(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 8), (4, 8), (6, 8)\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum and product for each pair:\n\n(1, 2) -> (1+2) + (1*2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n(1, 4) -> (1+4) + (1*4) = 5 + 4 = 9\n(1, 6) -> (1+6) + (1*6) = 7 + 6 = 13\n(1, 8) -> (1+8) + (1*8) = 9 + 8 = 17\n(2, 4) -> (2+4) + (2*4) = 6 + 8 = 14\n(2, 8) -> (2+8) + (2*8) = 10 + 16 = 26\n(4, 8) -> (4+8) + (4*8) = 12 + 32 = 44\n(6, 8) -> (6+8) + (6*8) = 14 + 48 = 62\n\nNow, let's count the number of different possible values:\n\nA. 21 (none of these options are correct)\nB. 27\nC. 49\nD. 45\n\nThere are 8 different possible values that can be obtained when the sum of two positive even integers less than 15 is added to their product.",
