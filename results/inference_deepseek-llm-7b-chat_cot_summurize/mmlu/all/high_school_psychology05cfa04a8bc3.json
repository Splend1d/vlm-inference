The occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information from the eyes, and it is the part of the brain that initially processes information from the optic nerve. The other options are involved in different functions in the brain, such as controlling body temperature (hypothalamus), relaying sensory information between the brain and the rest of the body (thalamus), and playing a role in memory and emotional processing (hippocampus).",
