A business owner owns the central parcel in fee simple and maintains his dwelling house thereon.

Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.\n\nassistant:The question is a legal hypothetical about the use of a right-of-way across a piece of land (the eastern parcel). The business owner has a right-of-way to cross the eastern parcel on foot, by bicycle, or automobile, granted in a written agreement. The business owner uses this right-of-way for delivering supplies to their office building, which is on both the western and central parcels. The office workers also use the right-of-way for commuting to work. The landscaper, who owns the eastern parcel, is asking the court to enjoin (stop) the business owner and the office workers from using the right-of-way across their land.\n\nOption A states that the business owner's right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers. However, the question does not provide enough information about the \"excessive use\" to determine this.\n\nOption B states that the business owner's right-of-way would be forfeited due to the unauthorized use by the office workers. This could be a possibility if the right-of-way agreement specifically states that the business owner and their employees can only use the right-of-way for specific purposes, and if the office workers are using it for commuting. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine whether this is the case.\n\nOption C states that the business owner, by making use of the right-of-way beyond the scope of the original privilege, would permanently be enjoined from using the servient tenement. This could be a possibility if the right-of-way agreement specifically states that the business owner can only use the right-of-way for specific purposes, and if they are using it for other purposes. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine whether this is the case.\n\nOption D states that although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use. This seems to be the most likely answer, as it suggests that the court would not stop the business owner from using the right-of-way, but would stop the office workers from using it. This could be a possibility if the right-of-way agreement specifically states that the business owner can only use the right-of-way for specific purposes, and if the office workers are using it for commuting.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.",
