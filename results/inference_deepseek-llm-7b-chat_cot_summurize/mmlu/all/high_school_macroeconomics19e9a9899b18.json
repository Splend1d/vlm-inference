Production of goods and services has remained constant.\n\nNow, let's consider the two types of GDP: nominal GDP and real GDP.\n\nNominal GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country during a specific period, typically a year, before adjusting for inflation. In this case, if the price level has risen, the nominal GDP would be higher because more goods and services are being sold at higher prices.\n\nReal GDP, on the other hand, is the value of all goods and services produced in a country, after adjusting for inflation. It measures the total output of goods and services, in constant prices. Since production has remained constant, real GDP would not change.\n\nBased on the information given, nominal GDP would increase, while real GDP would remain constant.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
