Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father was not in imminent danger from his son.\nD. Deny the self-defense instruction, because the father used excessive force.\n\nassistant:B. Give the self-defense instruction, because the evidence was sufficient to raise the defense.\n\nIn this case, the father presented evidence that he was in fear for his life due to his son's violent behavior while under the influence of crack cocaine. The evidence of the son's loud and obscene remarks, as well as the father's fear of being physically abused again, supports the father's claim of being in imminent danger. Therefore, the judge should give the self-defense instruction, as it is appropriate to instruct the jury on the defense of self-defense in this case.\n\nA. This answer is incorrect because it does not address the sufficiency of the evidence to raise the defense.\nC. This answer is incorrect because the father's fear of his son's violent behavior was sufficient to raise the defense of self-defense.\nD. This answer is incorrect because excessive force is not a valid defense to a charge of murder. The defense of self-defense is based on the necessity of using force to protect oneself from an immediate threat of harm.",
