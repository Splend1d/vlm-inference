Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical.

Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\nC. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\nD. Easement appurtenant.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.\n\nThe country club purchased 50 acres of land from the land development company, with the condition that the land can be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. This purchase is subject to the condition that the property can only be used as a country club.\n\nA fee simple determinable is incorrect because there is no determinable term specified in the deed. A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is the most accurate description for the country club's interest in the land, as the purchase is subject to the condition that the land can only be used as a country club.\n\nA determinable fee subject to an executory interest is incorrect because there is no executory interest mentioned in the deed. An easement appurtenant is incorrect because the deed does not mention any easement.",
