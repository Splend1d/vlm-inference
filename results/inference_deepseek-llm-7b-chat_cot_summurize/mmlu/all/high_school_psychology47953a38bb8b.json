For taste, this is Bessie's\n\nA. absolute threshold\nB. difference threshold\nC. subliminal stimulation\nD. distal stimulus\n\nassistant:The user is describing a scenario where Bessie, who has a very low sensitivity to sweetness, can barely detect sweetness in a sip of water. This indicates that the amount of sweetness added to the water is very low, and it's below Bessie's sensitivity threshold. This situation corresponds to the \"absolute threshold,\" which is the minimum amount of a stimulus required for a person to detect it. Therefore, the answer is A. absolute threshold.",
