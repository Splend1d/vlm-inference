There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.\n\nThis study is not a controlled experiment, as it only surveyed 50 basketball players and did not control for other factors that could influence point scoring. A confounding variable could be the fact that the 25 players who study more hours might already be more skilled or talented, which could explain why they score more points. Another confounding variable could be that the players who study more hours might be more motivated or disciplined, which could also explain the higher point average. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that more studying leads to higher point scoring without more evidence and a more controlled experiment.",
