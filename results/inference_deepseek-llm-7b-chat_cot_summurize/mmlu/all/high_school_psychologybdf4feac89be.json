Detection of a just-noticeable difference (JND) depends on the presence of a \"no stimulus\" control and the sensitivity of the signal-detection equipment.\n\nA JND is the smallest difference between two stimuli that is just noticeable. It is used to measure the threshold of detectability of a stimulus and is an important concept in psychology and neuroscience. The detection of a JND depends on several factors, including the presence of a \"no stimulus\" control and the sensitivity of the signal-detection equipment.\n\nA \"no stimulus\" control is a baseline against which the difference between two stimuli can be measured. Without a control, it is difficult to accurately determine the JND. The sensitivity of the signal-detection equipment refers to how sensitive the equipment is to detecting the difference between the two stimuli. If the equipment is not sensitive enough, it may not detect the difference between the two stimuli, even if it is significant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",
