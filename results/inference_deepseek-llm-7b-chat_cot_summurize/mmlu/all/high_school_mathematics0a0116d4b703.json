In this case, we have $\\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{5}} \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} = 10 \\cdot 5 = 50$, which is the greatest possible quotient. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nA. 5 is not the greatest quotient.\nB. 10 is the greatest quotient.\nC. 20 is not the greatest quotient.\nD. 25 is not the greatest quotient.",
