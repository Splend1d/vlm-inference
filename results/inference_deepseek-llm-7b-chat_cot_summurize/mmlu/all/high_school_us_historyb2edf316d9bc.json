The Baby Boom\n\nassistant:An example of the threat to civil liberties that concerned Roosevelt was the Executive Order 9066, which interned Japanese Americans. This was a concern for Roosevelt because it violated their freedom of religion and assembly. The other options, such as the Social Security Act and the G.I. Bill, did not pose a threat to civil liberties in the way that Executive Order 9066 did. The Baby Boom was more of a demographic phenomenon and did not directly threaten civil liberties.",
