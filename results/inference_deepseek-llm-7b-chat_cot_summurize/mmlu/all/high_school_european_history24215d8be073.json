This suggests that there was a diversity of opinions and beliefs regarding religion, which could indicate the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the eighteenth century.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the quotation does not provide any evidence of a clergy's monopoly on academic scholarship in eighteenth-century Britain.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the quotation does not suggest that British scholars hated all things Roman. In fact, it shows a diversity of perspectives on Roman religion.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the quotation does not suggest a lack of sources available to the eighteenth-century scholar for the study of ancient Roman civilization. Instead, it provides insight into the diversity of opinions and beliefs regarding religion in ancient Rome.",
