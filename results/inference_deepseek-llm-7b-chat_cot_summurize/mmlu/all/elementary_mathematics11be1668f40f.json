At the end of the day he has collected $339.80. How many bunches of roses did he sell?\n\nA. 22\nB. 18\nC. 20\nD. 16\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation to represent the information given. Let's assume that Chris sold x bunches of roses.\n\nThe cost of each bunch of roses is $16.99, so the total amount of money collected is:\n\n$16.99 * x\n\nThe total amount of money collected is given as $339.80, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$16.99 * x = $339.80\n\nNow we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $16.99:\n\nx = $339.80 / $16.99\n\nx \u2248 20\n\nSo, Chris sold approximately 20 bunches of roses. The answer is C. 20.",
