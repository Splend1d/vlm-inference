The periphery countries are the least developed and economically weak countries.\n\nThis theory was first proposed by Immanuel Wallerstein in the 1970s as a way to understand the global economic and political structure. According to this theory, the core countries control the global economy and exploit the periphery countries for their resources and labor. The semi-periphery countries play a middle ground between the core and the periphery, often acting as intermediaries between the two.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. core, periphery, and semi-periphery.",
