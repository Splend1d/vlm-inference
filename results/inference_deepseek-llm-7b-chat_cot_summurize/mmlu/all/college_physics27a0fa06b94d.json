A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\n\nA. 0.4c\nB. 0.5c\nC. 0.6c\nD. 0.7c\n\nassistant:Let's denote the speed of the two spaceships as $v_1$ and $v_2$. We are given that the observer on Earth measures their speeds to be equal, so we have the equation $v_1 = v_2$.\n\nWe are also given that a meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. This means that the distance between the two spaceships is 60 cm.\n\nUsing the speed of light, $c$, and the distance between the two spaceships, we can calculate their relative speed. In the reference frame of the observer on Earth, the relative speed of the two spaceships is:\n\n$v_{relative} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 60 \\, \\text{cm}}{1 \\, \\text{m}} = \\frac{120 \\, \\text{cm}}{1 \\, \\text{m}} = 1.2 \\, \\text{c}$\n\nSince we know that $v_1 = v_2$, and the observer on Earth measures their speeds to be equal, we can write:\n\n$1.2 \\, \\text{c} = 0.5 \\, \\text{c}$\n\nNow we can solve for $v_1$:\n\n$1.2 \\, \\text{c} = 0.5 \\, \\text{c}$\n\n$v_1 = 0.5 \\, \\text{c}$\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is $\\boxed{\\textbf{B}. 0.5c}$.",
