Diode laser\nB. Dye laser\nC. Free-electron laser\nD. Gas laser\n\nassistant:D. Gas laser\n\nGas lasers utilize transitions that involve the energy levels of free atoms. In a gas laser, a high-intensity light beam is focused onto the active medium, which is a gas or a vapor. When the atoms or molecules in the active medium absorb the light, they jump to a higher energy level, and then release the energy in the form of light. This process is called stimulated emission. The stimulated emission of light in the same frequency as the input beam causes a feedback effect, amplifying the light and producing a continuous laser beam.",
