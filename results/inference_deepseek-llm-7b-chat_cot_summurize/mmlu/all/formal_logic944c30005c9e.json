Option A incorrectly states that my headache is not a dualist state, whereas it should state that it is a dualist state. Option C incorrectly states that everything is either mental or physical, whereas it should state that everything is either physical or mental. Option D incorrectly states that my broken toe is a mental state, whereas it should state that it is not a mental state.",
