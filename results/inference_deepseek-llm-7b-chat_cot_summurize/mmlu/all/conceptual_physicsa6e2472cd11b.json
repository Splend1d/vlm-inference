If it shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter with no change in mass on the shrunken surface you'd weigh\n\nA. 1/100 as much\nB. 10 times as much\nC. 100 times as much\nD. 1000 times as much\n\nassistant:The weight of an object is determined by the force of gravity acting on it. The formula for weight is given by:\n\nweight = mass \u00d7 gravity\n\nwhere mass is the amount of matter in an object, and gravity is the force of attraction between the object and the center of the Earth.\n\nThe force of gravity on Earth is approximately 9.81 N/kg.\n\nIf the planet were to shrink to one-tenth its original diameter with no change in mass, the distance from the center of the Earth to the surface of the planet would also be one-tenth of its original diameter. Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity would be 9.81 \\* 10 = 98.1 N/kg.\n\nSince weight is equal to mass times gravity, the weight of an object on the shrunken planet would be 100 times its original weight.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 100 times as much.",
