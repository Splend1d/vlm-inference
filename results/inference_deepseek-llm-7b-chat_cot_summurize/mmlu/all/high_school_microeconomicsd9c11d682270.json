At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?\n\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nC. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nD. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.\n\nassistant:To maximize utility, we can set up a utility function for each type of fruit and then find the optimal consumption combination. Let U(A) represent the utility Melanie gets from consuming an apple and U(O) represent the utility she gets from consuming an orange. Let x be the number of apples consumed and y be the number of oranges consumed. We can write the utility function as:\n\nU(x, y) = U(A) * x + U(O) * y\n\nMelanie's marginal utility of apples is 12, so U(A) = 12. Her marginal utility of oranges is 18, so U(O) = 18.\n\nMelanie has already spent all of her lunch money, so her budget constraint is given by:\n\n1 * x + 2 * y = 0\n\nSolving for y, we get y = -x / 2. Since Melanie has already spent all her money, she cannot consume a negative number of apples or oranges. Therefore, y = -x / 2 is not a valid consumption decision.\n\nTo maximize utility, we need to find the utility-maximizing combination of apples and oranges. We can use the concept of diminishing marginal utility to find the optimal consumption decision. As Melanie consumes more apples or oranges, the additional utility gained per unit decreases.\n\nLet's assume Melanie wants to consume a certain number of apples and oranges, say A and O. To find the optimal combination of A and O, we can set up a utility function for each type of fruit and then find the utility-maximizing combination:\n\nU(A) = A * 12\nU(O) = O * 18\n\nThe budget constraint is:\n\n1 * A + 2 * O = 0\n\nSolving for O, we get O = -A / 2. Since Melanie cannot consume a negative number of oranges, this is not a valid consumption decision.\n\nWe can also consider the case where the marginal utility per dollar is equal for apples and oranges. In this case, the optimal consumption decision is to consume the same number of apples and oranges. Let's assume Melanie wants to consume A apples and O oranges. The budget constraint becomes:\n\n1 * A + 2 * O = 0\n\nSolving for A, we get A = -O / 1.25. Since this is not a valid consumption decision, the optimal consumption decision is not to change her consumption decision at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.",
