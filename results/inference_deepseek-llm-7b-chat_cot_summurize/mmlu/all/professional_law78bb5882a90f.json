Before going to the theater, the classmate drove to a dealer's home to buy some marijuana. The dealer lived approximately two miles from the theater. After picking up the marijuana, the classmate then drove to the concert. As he was driving to the concert, the classmate smoked two marijuana cigarettes so that he could be \"high\" for the show.

While the car was parked outside the theater, it was struck by another car and damaged, requiring repairs costing $750. Since the classmate was driving the car at the time of the accident, and it was under his control, he is considered to be responsible for the damage. Therefore, the plaintiff (the student) has the right to recover the cost of repairing the car, which is the value of the car before it was damaged.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text does not mention that the car was used for a purpose other than that for which it was lent. Option B is incorrect because the text does not state that the classmate used the car for a purpose other than that for which it was lent. Option D is incorrect because the text does not mention that the classmate was not negligent in causing the car's damage.",
