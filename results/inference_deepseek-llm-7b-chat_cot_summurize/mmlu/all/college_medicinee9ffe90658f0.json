Elaborative rehearsal\n\nassistant:The student's process can be characterized as elaborative rehearsal. This is a type of learning that involves connecting new information to existing knowledge, as the student does by relating electrochemical cells to previous knowledge of redox reactions. This helps to deepen understanding and strengthen memory retention.",
