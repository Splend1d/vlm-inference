This means that the consumer will continue eating cookies until the marginal benefit (the additional satisfaction gained from eating one more cookie) equals the marginal cost (the additional cost or effort required to eat one more cookie).\n\nWhen the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, the consumer is maximizing their overall satisfaction and minimizing their overall cost. This is known as the optimal stopping rule, which is a concept in economics that describes the point at which an individual should stop consuming a good in order to maximize their utility or satisfaction.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the next cookie.",
