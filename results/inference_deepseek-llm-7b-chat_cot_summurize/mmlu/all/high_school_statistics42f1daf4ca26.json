The new mean of the appraised values of houses will be $125,000 + $5,000 = $130,000. The new standard deviation will be:\n\n$SD \\times \\sqrt{1.1} = $23,000 \\times \\sqrt{1.1}\n\n$23,000 \\times \\sqrt{1.1} \\approx $28,000\n\nTherefore, the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city will be approximately $28,000.
