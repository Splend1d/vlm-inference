This is because federal law does not exclude innocent landowners from the regulatory scheme when it comes to environmental hazards. The landowner had a contractual relationship with the chemical company, and it had a duty to inspect the property to determine what the tenant was doing there. Therefore, the court may impose liability on the landowner for the environmental hazards caused by the release of toxic chemicals.",
