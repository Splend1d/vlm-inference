Ismail proclaimed himself to be a Caliph\n\nassistant:The passage provided refers to a letter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid Shah Ismail I in 1514. The letter states that both the fatwas of distinguished scholars and the consensus of the Sunni community agree that the ancient obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation must be the aim of their exalted aspiration. This implies that the Safavids were introducing evil innovation that was against the order of Islamic empires like the Ottoman and the Mughal Empires.\n\nThe Safavids drew the ire of Islamic empires such as the Ottoman and the Mughal Empires primarily because the Safavids rejected the central tenets of Islam. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. rejected the central tenets of Islam",
