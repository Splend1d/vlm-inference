Women's suffrage\nB. Trust-busting\nC. Greater rights for unions\nD. Weakening political machines\n\nassistant:The passage above describes the establishment of a boarding club for working girls during a strike in a large shoe factory. The club was formed to provide support and assistance to its members during difficult times, such as strikes, and to help them stand behind each other in times of need. This demonstrates a strong sense of solidarity and community among the members, and a desire to help each other out during difficult times.\n\nThis type of organization and support system is directly related to the goals of unions, as unions often provide similar support and assistance to their members during strikes and other work-related issues. Therefore, the passage most directly supports the political goal of \"Greater rights for unions.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Greater rights for unions.",
