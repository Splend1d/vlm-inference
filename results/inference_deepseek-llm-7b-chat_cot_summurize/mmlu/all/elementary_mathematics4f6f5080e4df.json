At that rate, approximately how many times will Pat bounce the ball in 150 seconds?\n\nA. 120\nB. 125\nC. 144\nD. 145\n\nassistant:Pat bounces a basketball 25 times in 30 seconds. To find out approximately how many times Pat will bounce the ball in 150 seconds, we can set up a proportion:\n\n25 basketball bounces / 30 seconds = x basketball bounces / 150 seconds\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n25 * 150 = 30 * x\n\n3750 = 30x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 30:\n\nx = 3750 / 30\n\nx \u2248 125\n\nSo, approximately Pat will bounce the ball 125 times in 150 seconds. The correct answer is B. 125.",
