You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: If real GDP per capita was $10000 in 1990 and $15000 in 2000 then the amount of economic growth is\n\nA. 0.5 percent.\nB. 5.0 percent.\nC. 50 percent.\nD. 3.3 percent.\n\nassistant:To calculate the amount of economic growth between 1990 and 2000, we can use the formula for GDP growth rate:\n\nGDP growth rate = ((GDP in 2000 / GDP in 1990) - 1) \\* 100\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nGDP growth rate = ((15000 / 10000) - 1) \\* 100\n\nGDP growth rate = (1.5 - 1) \\* 100\n\nGDP growth rate = 0.5 \\* 100\n\nGDP growth rate = 50\n\nSo the amount of economic growth between 1990 and 2000 is 50 percent.
