People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.\n\nThe primary impact of Humanism ceasing to be the exclusive privilege of the few was that it allowed for a wider range of people to question and challenge the teachings and practices of the Church. Erasmus' work in popularizing the classic spirit and making it accessible to the educated classes and beyond, enabled more people to engage with and critique the ideas of the humanists. This in turn fostered a more critical and questioning attitude towards Church doctrines and practices, contributing to the Reformation and the eventual decline of the Church's power.",
