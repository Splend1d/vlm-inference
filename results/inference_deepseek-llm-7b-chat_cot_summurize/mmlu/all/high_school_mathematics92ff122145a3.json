Let's find the coordinates of the vertices of pentagon P:\n\nP = (\u20132, \u20134), (\u20134, 1), (-1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0)\n\nNow let's reflect each vertex across the line y = x:\n\nP\u2019 = (\u20134, 1), (-1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0), (\u20132, \u20134)\n\nWe can see that the fourth vertex of P\u2019 is (2, 4). Therefore, the answer is C. (2, 2).",
