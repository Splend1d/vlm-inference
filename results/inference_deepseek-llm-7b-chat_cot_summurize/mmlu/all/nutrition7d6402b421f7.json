Leptin and insulin\nB. Leptin and ghrelin\nC. Ghrelin and leptin\nD. Ghrelin and insulin\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will search for the information on the two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, and their roles in regulating hunger and satiety.\n\nStep 1: Research leptin and ghrelin\nLeptin is a hormone produced by fat cells that helps regulate energy balance and hunger. It signals to the brain when the body has enough fat stores, which in turn, reduces appetite.\n\nGhrelin, on the other hand, is produced in the stomach and signals to the brain when the body is hungry. It stimulates appetite and hunger.\n\nStep 2: Determine which hormone acts on the hypothalamus to increase satiety and hunger, respectively\nSince leptin signals satiety and ghrelin signals hunger, the correct answer is B. Leptin and ghrelin. Leptin acts on the hypothalamus to increase satiety, while ghrelin acts on the hypothalamus to increase hunger.",
