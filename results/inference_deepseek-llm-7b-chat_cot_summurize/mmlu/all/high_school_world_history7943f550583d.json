Sunni Islam\nB. Buddhism\nC. Zoroastrianism\nD. Jainism\n\nassistant:The religious movement that was ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages is Zoroastrianism.\n\nZoroastrianism is an ancient religion that originated in Persia (modern-day Iran) and is based on the teachings of its founder, Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra). Zoroastrianism places great emphasis on the concept of good and evil, or light and darkness, and the struggle between these opposing forces. One of the key tenets of the religion is the belief in the absolute monotheistic God, Ahura Mazda, who is the creator and ruler of the universe.\n\nAccording to Zoroastrianism, the material world is considered impure and corrupt, and physical representations of spiritual entities, such as holy images, are seen as idols that can lead to spiritual corruption. As a result, Zoroastrians are prohibited from creating any images or idols, believing that they can lead to idolatry and ultimately, the worship of false gods.\n\nIn contrast, the sentiments expressed in the passages from John of Damascus and the Decree of the Second Council of Nicaea support the use of holy images as a means of venerating and honoring God. John of Damascus, a Christian theologian, argued that images are useful for those who are illiterate or unable to read, providing a visual representation of God and the divine. The Second Council of Nicaea, a council of the Christian Church, also endorsed the use of holy images as a tradition that helps in showing the incarnation of the Word of God as real and not just fantastic.\n\nTherefore, the ideological opposition to the sentiments expressed in the passages about the use of holy images is found in Zoroastrianism, which does not allow the creation of any images or idols due to its belief in the absolute purity of God and the importance of avoiding idolatry.",
