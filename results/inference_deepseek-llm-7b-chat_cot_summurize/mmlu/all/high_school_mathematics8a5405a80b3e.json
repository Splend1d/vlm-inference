As an improper fraction, for how long is the cannonball above a height of $6$ meters?\n\nA. \\frac{5}{7}\nB. \\frac{7}{12}\nC. \\frac{12}{7}\nD. \\frac{7}{5}\n\nassistant:To find the time it takes for the cannonball to be above a height of 6 meters, we need to find the point on the trajectory where $h(t) = 6$.\n\nFirst, let's set $h(t)$ equal to 6:\n$-4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 = 6$\n\nNow, let's solve for $t$.\n\nWe can factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n$2(-2.41t + 7) = 6$\n\nNext, we can distribute the -2.41:\n$2(7) - 2.41(7)t = 6$\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for $t$:\n$-2.41t + 14 = 6$\n\nNow, subtract 14 from both sides:\n$-2.41t = -8$\n\nFinally, divide both sides by -2.41 to solve for $t$:\n$t = \\frac{8}{-2.41} \\approx 3.27$ seconds\n\nNow that we have the value of $t$, we can find the duration of time the cannonball is above a height of 6 meters. The time before and after the point where $h(t) = 6$ are the same, so we can find the total duration by doubling the time the cannonball is above 6 meters.\n\nTotal duration = 2 * 3.27 seconds\nTotal duration \u2248 6.54 seconds\n\nNow, let's convert this time to an improper fraction:\n$6.54 \\approx \\frac{27}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \\frac{7}{5}.",
