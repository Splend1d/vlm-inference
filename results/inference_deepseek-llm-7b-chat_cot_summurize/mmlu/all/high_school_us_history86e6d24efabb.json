Creating independent principalities for themselves\n\nassistant:The Spanish in America were interested in expanding territories under Spanish control. This is evident from the passage, which describes Hernando Cortes's determination to conquer Mexico and the various groups of people he gathered to achieve this goal. These groups included adventurers, hidalgos, and native tribes who were united by Cortes's leadership and the common goal of expanding Spanish control in the region. The passage does not mention any of the other options provided as motivations for the Spanish in America.",
