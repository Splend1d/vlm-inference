The weight, in pounds, of each of the four books on the shelf is 2.5, 3.2, 2.7, 2.3 Which inequality represents the weight, w, of any book chosen from the shelf?\n\nA. w > 2.3\nB. w < 2.4\nC. w > 3.2\nD. w < 3.3\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. w > 2.3.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of all four books on the shelf. The sum of the weights of the four books is 2.5 + 3.2 + 2.7 + 2.3 = 11.7.\n\nNow, we can find the inequality that represents the weight of any book chosen from the shelf. Since the weight of any book is greater than 2.3 pounds, we can write the inequality as w > 2.3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. w > 2.3.",
