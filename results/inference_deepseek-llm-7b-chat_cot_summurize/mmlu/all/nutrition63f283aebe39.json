Pancreatic \u00e1-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose is the correct statement. The pancreas secretes a large amount of digestive enzymes after a meal, including pancreatic \u00e1-amylase, which hydrolyses starch to free glucose. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Pepsinogen is not the chief enzyme that digests protein; it is pepsin. Pepsinogen requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work, but it is not the main enzyme responsible for protein digestion.\n\nC. Enteropeptidase does not convert trypsinogen to trypsin; instead, it is a protease that cleaves proteins, including trypsinogen, at specific peptide bonds. The peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsinogen is not removed by enteropeptidase.\n\nD. Pancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is not required for maximal pancreatic enzyme activity in the duodenum. Hydrochloric acid is produced by the gastric glands in the stomach, not the pancreas. The primary function of hydrochloric acid is to initiate protein digestion by activating pepsin.",
