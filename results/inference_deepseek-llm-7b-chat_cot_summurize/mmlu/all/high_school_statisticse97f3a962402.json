Simple random sample (SRS)\n\nA stratified sample would be appropriate if you wanted to compare the attitudes towards tracking between different subgroups within the town (e.g., urban, suburban, and rural communities). However, in this case, the question is about the attitudes towards tracking within each of the three categories of students (honors, regular, and below-grade classes), so a simple random sample would be more appropriate. This would ensure that each group is equally represented in the sample and that every student has an equal chance of being included.\n\nA convenience sample, on the other hand, would be chosen based on convenience rather than representativeness, and a systematic sample would be chosen based on a pre-determined pattern. Neither of these methods would provide an accurate representation of attitudes towards tracking within the different categories of students.",
