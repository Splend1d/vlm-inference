Long of Louisiana on February 23, 1934, in which he discusses his proposal for the \"Share Our Wealth Society.\" This society's motto is \"Every Man a King,\" and its goal is to limit the wealth of big men in the country and provide a guaranteed family wealth of around $5,000 to every family in America. According to the text, no man should own more than $50,000,000.\n\nBased on the content of the speech, it is clear that Senator Long's \"Share the Wealth Society\" was a political program intended to persuade voters that he had a plan to combat the Great Depression. This can be inferred from the fact that he is discussing the proposal in a radio address and using it as a platform to attract support from the public. The other options, such as demonstrating Senator Long's commitment to fighting communism, returning the United States to the economic ideas of the late nineteenth century, or showcasing Senator Long's understanding of the constitutional ideas of the Founding Fathers, are not supported by the text or the context of the speech. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. persuade voters that Senator Long had a plan to combat the Great Depression.",
