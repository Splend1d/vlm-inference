Instead, it continued to develop and flourish for centuries after. The answer that corresponds to this is option C.\n\nMayan civilization fell into decline, moved its center north, resurged, and fell into decline once again. This is supported by historical evidence, which indicates that the Mayan civilization experienced fluctuations in its power and influence over time, with periods of expansion and contraction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Mayan civilization did not disappear inexplicably after the classical period. Option B is incorrect because Mayan civilization did not lose a great war with Teotihuac\u00e1n. Instead, it continued to thrive independently for centuries after the classical period. Option D is incorrect because Mayan civilization did not suddenly disappear, and it did continue to build monumental structures.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Mayan civilization fell into decline, moved its center north, resurged, and fell into decline once again.",
