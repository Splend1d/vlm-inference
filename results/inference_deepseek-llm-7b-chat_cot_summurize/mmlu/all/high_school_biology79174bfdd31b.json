Breeding with individuals from a different population may cause the extinction of the first population due to a decrease in diversity.\n\nassistant:A. Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population.\n\nThe statement is correct because small populations have less genetic variation, making them more vulnerable to environmental changes and diseases. Inbreeding can lead to the loss of genetic diversity, which can make the population more susceptible to extinction. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because migration, mutation, and breeding with individuals from different populations can actually help maintain genetic diversity and increase the resilience of a population.",
