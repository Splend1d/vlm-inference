Rostow.\n\nThe theory that cities grow outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth was proposed by Walt Whitman Rostow in his book \"The Process of Cultural Change.\" Rostow argued that cities grow through a series of stages, including \"Conquest,\" \"Exploitation,\" \"Industrialization,\" \"Urbanization,\" and \"High-Level Stability.\" This theory has been influential in urban planning and development.\n\nB. Ravenstein.\nC. von Th\ufffdnen.\nD. Harris and Ullmann.\n\nThese options are incorrect. George Ravenstein proposed the \"Ravenstein's Laws,\" which describe the factors that lead to the decline and abandonment of small towns and villages. Carl Wilhelm von Th\ufffdnen developed the \"Th\ufffdnen Map,\" which illustrates the optimal location of agricultural land based on crop prices. Harris and Ullmann are not associated with any urban growth theory.",
