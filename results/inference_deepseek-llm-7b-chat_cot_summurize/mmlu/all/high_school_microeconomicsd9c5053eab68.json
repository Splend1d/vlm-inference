The demand curve shifts to the right, and the supply curve shifts to the left.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The supply curve shifts to the left.\n\nWhen the supply curve shifts to the left, it means that the cost of producing the good increases. This causes the equilibrium price of the good to increase.\n\nA is incorrect because the demand curve shift to the right lowers the equilibrium price of the good.\n\nC is incorrect because the demand curve shift to the left and the supply curve shift to the right both lower the equilibrium price of the good.\n\nD is incorrect because the demand curve shift to the right and the supply curve shift to the left both lower the equilibrium price of the good.",
