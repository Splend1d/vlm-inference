During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\nB. admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\nC. inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nassistant:The television correspondent's testimony is inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nHearsay is a statement made out of court that someone else relies on as evidence. In this case, the opponent's statement about the mayor was recorded by the television correspondent, but she did not actually hear the opponent make the statement. Instead, she recorded it based on what she observed and remembered. This type of evidence is considered hearsay because it is not directly given by the person making the statement.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the hearsay rule, but in this case, none of them apply. One exception is when the statement is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but in this case, the purpose of the television correspondent's testimony is to testify about her recollection of the opponent's statement, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Another exception is when the statement is offered to prove the content of the statement, but in this case, the opponent's statement is already on record in the television correspondent's notebook.\n\nTherefore, the television correspondent's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay, and the court will not allow it to be presented as evidence. The mayor's suit for defamation will likely be dismissed, and the judge may instruct the jury to disregard the television correspondent's testimony.",
