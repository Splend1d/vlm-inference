O(log log N)\nD. O(N)\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. O(log e^N): As e^N grows very quickly, a function with this growth rate will also grow very quickly. So, this option is not the slowest.\n\nB. O(log N): This is the Big O notation for a logarithmic function. As N grows, the number of elements in the input will increase, causing the function to grow linearly. This is not the slowest.\n\nC. O(log log N): This is the Big O notation for a logarithmic function with two arguments. As N grows, the number of elements in the input will increase, causing the function to grow linearly. This is not the slowest.\n\nD. O(N): This is the Big O notation for a linear function. As N grows, the number of elements in the input will also increase, causing the function to grow linearly. This is the slowest growth rate among the options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. O(N).",
