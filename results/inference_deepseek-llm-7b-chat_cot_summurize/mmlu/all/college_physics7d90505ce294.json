Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\n\nA. 150 nm\nB. 200 nm\nC. 300 nm\nD. 400 nm\n\nassistant:The answer is B. 200 nm.\n\nThis question is related to the reflection of light off a thin film of oil on a glass slide. The reflection coefficient is given by the equation:\n\nr = (n1^2 - n2^2) / (n1^2 + n2^2)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the oil and glass, respectively.\n\nThe condition for maximum reflection, or the critical angle, can be given by:\n\ntan(theta_c) = n2 / n1\n\nSolving for the critical angle, we get:\n\ntheta_c = arccos(n1 * n2 / (n1 + n2))\n\nTo find the minimum thickness of the oil film, we need to find the critical angle and then solve for the distance between the oil and glass. The critical angle is the same for normal incidence and the maximum reflection angle.\n\nThe maximum reflection angle is given by:\n\ntheta_max = arcsin(n2 / (n1 + n2))\n\nNow, we can solve for the minimum distance between the oil and glass:\n\nd = 2 * n1 * n2 / (n1 + n2) * theta_max\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nd = 2 * 1.2 * 1.6 / (1.2 + 1.6) * 45 degrees\nd = 2 * 1.2 * 1.6 / 2.8 * 45 degrees\nd = 480 nm\n\nHowever, this result is not valid because the distance between the oil and glass should be less than half the wavelength of the light. In this case, it should be less than half the wavelength of 480 nanometers. Therefore, we need to find the minimum distance between the oil and glass that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe minimum distance between the oil and glass should be given by:\n\nd = (n1 + n2) / n1 * theta_max\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nd = (1.2 + 1.6) / 1.2 * 45 degrees\nd = 2.8 * 45 degrees\nd = 126 degrees\n\nNow, we can solve for the minimum thickness of the oil film:\n\nt = 2 * d / (2 * pi * n2)\nt = 2 * 126 degrees / (2 * pi * 1.6)\nt = 2 * 126 degrees / (2 * pi * 1.6)\nt = 150 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film is 150 nanometers. However, this is still not valid because it is greater than the minimum distance between the oil and glass. Therefore, we need to find the minimum thickness of the oil film that satisfies both conditions.\n\nThe minimum thickness of the oil film that satisfies both conditions is 200 nanometers.",
