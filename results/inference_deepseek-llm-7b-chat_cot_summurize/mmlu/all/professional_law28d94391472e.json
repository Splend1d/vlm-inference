Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the convenience store when he decided to break into the store to steal beer and cigarettes. The defendant threw a brick through the window of the convenience store and quickly went inside. Awakened by the alarm, the victim went down the stairs and into the convenience store. Seeing the victim, the defendant turned and began to run. Seeing the defendant running away with a case of beer and a carton of cigarettes, the victim ran after the defendant but tripped and fell, breaking his neck, which resulted in his immediate death. If the defendant is subsequently charged with the victim's death, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty of felony murder.\nB. guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nC. guilty of voluntary manslaughter.\nD. not guilty, because it was unforeseeable that a death would occur under the circumstances.\n\nassistant:The defendant is most likely to be found guilty of felony murder. This is because the defendant's burglary of the convenience store was a predicate act in the commission of which the victim was killed. Felony murder is a type of murder that occurs during the commission of a felony, and it can be charged even if the defendant did not intend to kill the victim.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter and voluntary manslaughter involve a lower level of culpability than felony murder, as they involve the defendant's intent to cause harm, but not necessarily to cause death. The defendant's act of breaking into the convenience store and stealing goods can be considered a predicate act for involuntary manslaughter, but since the defendant did not intend to kill the victim, it is less likely that he would be charged with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter involves a higher level of culpability than involuntary manslaughter, as it involves the defendant's intent to cause death or serious bodily harm. However, since the defendant's intent was only to steal goods and not to kill the victim, it is unlikely that he would be charged with voluntary manslaughter.\n\nThe defendant's defense of unforeseeable consequences could potentially mitigate his culpability, but it is not a valid defense in this case because the defendant's actions directly led to the victim's death. Therefore, the defendant is most likely to be found guilty of felony murder.",
