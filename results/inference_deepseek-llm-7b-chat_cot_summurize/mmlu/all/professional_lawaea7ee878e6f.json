The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. The manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 right away. The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract. Defendant buyer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the statute of frauds was violated in that it was a contract for over $500 that was unenforceable under state law.

Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\nC.

No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\nThe statute of frauds is a state law that requires certain contracts to be in writing in order to be enforceable. In this case, the contract for the manufacture and delivery of the widgets is worth over $500, and it was not in writing. However, there is an exception for contracts for the sale of goods that are specially made to order or specifically customized for the buyer. Since the widgets were imprinted with the buyer's logo and were made to the buyer's specifications, the statute of frauds does not apply and the contract is enforceable. Therefore, the court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss.",
