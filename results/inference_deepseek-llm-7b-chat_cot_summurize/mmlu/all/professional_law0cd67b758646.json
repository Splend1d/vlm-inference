The pilot made a poor decision by deciding to navigate through the fog, which put both him and his passenger at risk. As a licensed pilot, he had a duty to exercise reasonable care in operating the airplane, and his decision to fly through the fog constituted a breach of that duty. Additionally, the fog was a known danger, and the pilot's decision to fly through it was unreasonable. Therefore, the passenger's family may be able to recover damages for their loss.",
