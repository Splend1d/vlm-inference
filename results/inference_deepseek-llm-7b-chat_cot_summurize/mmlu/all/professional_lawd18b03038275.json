He was traveling at a speed of over 100 M. P. H. when he lost control of the car and jumped a curb, striking a woman who was walking along the sidewalk. As a result of the collision, the woman suffered severe internal injuries and fractured both legs. She was hospitalized for 11 months and became permanently disabled.

According to the legal principle of \"felony murder,\" a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts if he commits a felony that results in death. In this case, the defendant's reckless driving, which led to the loss of control of the car and the collision with the woman, resulted in her death. Therefore, he should be found guilty of attempted murder.",
