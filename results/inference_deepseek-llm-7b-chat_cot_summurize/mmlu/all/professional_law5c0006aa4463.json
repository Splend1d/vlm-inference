No, because a landlord cannot be held liable for negligent design or maintenance, even under the modern rule.\n\nassistant:A. Yes, the landlord is strictly liable for the abnormally dangerous condition that he knowingly allowed to exist.\n\nThe landlord is found negligent in the design and construction of the stairs and in failing to maintain the stairs, steps, and railing in a safe condition. This negligence led to the tenant's daughter falling from the second-floor outdoor stairway, resulting in injuries. The modern rule for strict liability is that the landlord is strictly liable for the abnormally dangerous condition that he knowingly allowed to exist. The landlord cannot appeal this case, as the modern rule holds them strictly liable for the dangerous condition.\n\nB. Yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect its tenants and others from injury caused by a foreseeable risk of harm.\n\nUnder the modern rule, the landlord has a duty to use due care in maintaining the property to ensure the safety of its tenants and others. The landlord failed to meet this duty, resulting in the tenant's daughter falling from the stairway and sustaining injuries. The modern rule holds the landlord liable for their negligence, as they have a duty to protect others from foreseeable risks of harm.\n\nC. No, because the landlord still enjoys the common law protection of the doctrine of \"lessee beware,\" and residential property is generally still rented \"as is.\"\n\nThis answer is incorrect. The modern rule does not protect landlords from liability for the dangerous condition of their property. The landlord's failure to maintain the property in a safe condition and their negligence in the design and construction of the stairs resulted in the tenant's daughter falling and sustaining injuries. The modern rule holds the landlord liable for their negligence and the dangerous condition of the property.\n\nD. No, because a landlord cannot be held liable for negligent design or maintenance, even under the modern rule.\n\nThis answer is also incorrect. The modern rule does hold landlords liable for negligent design and maintenance of their property, as well as their failure to maintain the property in a safe condition. The landlord's negligence in the design and construction of the stairs and their failure to maintain the property in a safe condition resulted in the tenant's daughter falling and sustaining injuries. The modern rule holds the landlord liable for their negligence and the dangerous condition of the property.",
