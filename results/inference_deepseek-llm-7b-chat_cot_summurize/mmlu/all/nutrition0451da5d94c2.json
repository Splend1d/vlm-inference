Alpha limit dextrins\nC. Sucrose\nD. polysaccharides\n\nassistant:The answer is A. glucose.\n\nOral bacteria can synthesize extracellular glucans (dextran and mutan) from glucose, which is a dietary component that humans consume. Glucose is a simple sugar that is found in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, and grains. Oral bacteria can use glucose as a source of energy and nutrients, and they can also convert it into other types of carbohydrates, such as dextran and mutan.",
