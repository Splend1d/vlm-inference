This act prohibits agreements between competitors that restrain trade or commerce, which could apply to their secret agreement to keep prices high to protect their profitability. If found guilty, they could face prison time and fines under this act. The other options (B, C, and D) do not apply to their situation as they pertain to other aspects of commerce. B. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is related to consumer protection, C. The Adamson Act is related to minimum wage and hours laws, and D. retailers are allowed to set their own price levels, but the owners of the gasoline stations are in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act by making a secret agreement to keep prices high.",
