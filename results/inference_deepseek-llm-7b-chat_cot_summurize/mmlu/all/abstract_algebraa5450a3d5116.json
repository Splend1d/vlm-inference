False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every free abelian group is torsion free.\nThis statement is false. There exist torsion-free abelian groups that are not free. For example, the direct product of two nontrivial cyclic groups of prime order is an abelian group that is torsion-free, but not free.\n\nStatement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\nThis statement is true. If G is a finitely generated torsion-free abelian group, then G is isomorphic to a free abelian group of finite rank.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.",
