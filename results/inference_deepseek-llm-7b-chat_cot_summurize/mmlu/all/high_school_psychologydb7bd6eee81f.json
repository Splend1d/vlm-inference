Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language, and they can be combined to form words. For example, the word \"cat\" has three morphemes: \"c-a-t\". Each morpheme has a specific meaning, such as the first morpheme \"c\" representing the sound \"k\" and the second morpheme \"a\" representing the sound \"a\", and the third morpheme \"t\" representing the sound \"t\".\n\nA. phonemes are the basic units of sound in a language, and they are different from morphemes.\nB. phenotypes refer to physical characteristics, such as the shape of an organism's body, and they are not related to language.\nC. semantics refers to the study of meaning in language, but it is not the smallest unit of meaning in a language.",
