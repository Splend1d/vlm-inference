For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle.\n\nThis statement does not contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE. It simply reaffirms the idea that the Kshatriya caste was ideally suited for battles, which is consistent with the caste system's roles and divisions.",
