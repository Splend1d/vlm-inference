It is an executory interest of a springing type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. It is an executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the Rule against Perpetucies.\n\nUnder the Rule against Perpetuities, a devise will be void if it is contingent on an uncertain event occurring within a fixed period, or if it is executory and the interest it creates would not terminate within a fixed period. In this case, the son's interest in the property is contingent on the dogs receiving proper care, which is an uncertain event. Additionally, the interest does not terminate within a fixed period, which means it would not be considered executory. This combination of factors makes the son's interest void under the Rule against Perpetuities.",
