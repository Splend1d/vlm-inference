While low voter turnout can contribute to a perception of the government as illegitimate, it is not listed as one of the consequences in the given options. The other options are:\n\nB. a lack of true democracy: Low voter turnout can be seen as a sign of a lack of true democracy, as a larger percentage of citizens participating in the voting process is generally considered essential for a democracy to function effectively.\n\nC. a lack of minority representation: Low voter turnout can disproportionately affect minority populations, as they may be less likely to vote due to various social and economic factors. This can result in a lack of minority representation in government and decision-making processes.\n\nD. an imposition of a fine on non-voters: In some U.S. states, there are laws that impose fines on individuals who do not vote in elections. However, this is not a consequence of low voter turnout, but rather a method implemented to encourage voter participation.",
