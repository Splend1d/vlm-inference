The message also mentions that Austria-Hungary's ally, Germany, will make an effort to influence King Carol of Romania to fulfill his alliance duties, renounce Serbia, and suppress Rumanian agitation against Austria-Hungary. The telegram also mentions that Serbia is not within Germany's competence to interfere in the dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, but that Germany will stand by Austria-Hungary as required by the alliance and friendship.\n\nThe context of the telegram is the Balkan Question and the Triple Alliance, which consisted of Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was formed to protect each member's territories in the Balkans, where Pan-Slavic agitation was causing tension among the nations. Germany's telegram to Austria-Hungary in this case demonstrates their support for their ally and their commitment to the alliance, despite the ongoing dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.",
