The excerpt does not provide information about the religious tolerance of the Mongol administration in Russia, so we cannot compare this option.\n\nB. The excerpt does not provide information about the tribute system in Russia, so we cannot compare this option.\n\nC. The excerpt mentions that the Chinese are infidels and burn their dead, implying that they are not favorably viewed by the Chinese subjects, which matches the description of the Mongol administration in China.\n\nD. The excerpt does not provide information about trade between Russia and China, so we cannot compare this option.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is C. The Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest, which is different from the Mongol administration of its Russian domains in the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E.",
