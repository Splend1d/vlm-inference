Solar eclipses would be much rarer.\n\nIf the Moon's orbital plane were exactly the same as the ecliptic plane, it would be very rare for the Moon to be directly between the Earth and the Sun. This would cause a solar eclipse to occur less frequently, as there would be fewer opportunities for the Moon to block the Sun's light.",
