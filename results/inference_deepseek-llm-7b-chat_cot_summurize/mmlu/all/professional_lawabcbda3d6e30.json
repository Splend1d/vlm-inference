The carpenter's actions are not excused by an unforeseeable act of God, as the fire was caused by a human act (the destruction of the workshop). The beach houses would not necessarily suffer severe damage in the event of a hurricane, so option B is not the most likely reason for the woman's success in court. The carpenter's inability to perform due to the loss of inventory does not mean that he is not obligated to perform, so option D is incorrect. Therefore, the most likely outcome in this scenario is that the woman would succeed in her action for specific performance to compel the carpenter to build and deliver the storm windows.",
