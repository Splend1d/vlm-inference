The crosswind is at right angles to the airplane's direction of travel, so we need to add the crosswind speed to the airspeed of the airplane.\n\nGroundspeed = Airspeed + Crosswind speed\nGroundspeed = 40 km/h + 30 km/h\nGroundspeed = 70 km/h\n\nHowever, none of the given answer choices match the calculated groundspeed of 70 km/h.
