Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\n\nassistant:The strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency would be that Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment. This is because the power to issue cease and desist orders and to punish violations of those orders is a significant power, and it is important that the agency be accountable to the constitutionally established checks and balances of the U.S. legal system.\n\nThe other options are not as strong of an argument against the authority of this agency. Option A is not necessarily a constitutional argument, but rather a statement of what Congress may not do. Option C is not a valid argument because there is nothing in the text that prohibits enforcement of a federal law in another governmental body. Option D is not a valid argument because the text does not specify that only the U.S. Attorney General or the courts should have the power to appoint members of the agency.",
