These filings provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, and other important information that is required by law to be disclosed to the public. They can be found on the SEC's website, and are also available through various financial news and data providers. Other options listed, such as annual reports and press releases, may provide some useful information, but they are not as comprehensive or objective as 10-K filings. Newspaper articles, while they may contain some information about a company, are typically more biased and less reliable as a source of objective information.",
