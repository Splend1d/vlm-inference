You can never prove your theory to be correct only \"yet to be proven wrong.\"\n\nWhile it is exciting to have a new scientific theory, it is important to note that theories are not always proven correct and can be disproven with new evidence or experimentation. It is possible to test the theory through experiments and observations, but it is also possible that the theory may not hold up under scrutiny. Therefore, it is important to continue researching and testing the theory to see if it can be proven correct or if there is evidence that it is incorrect.",
