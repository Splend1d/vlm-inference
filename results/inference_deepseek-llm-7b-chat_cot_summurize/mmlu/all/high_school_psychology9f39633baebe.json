Which of the following best identifies the approach the psychologist has chosen?\n\nA. Cognitive social approach\nB. Behavioral approach\nC. Psychoanalytic approach\nD. Systems approach\n\nassistant:The psychologist is using a Systems approach. This approach focuses on understanding the relationships between family members and how they interact with one another, rather than just focusing on the individual behaviors of the child. It takes into account the dynamics of the entire family and how they may be contributing to the child's aggressive behavior. The other options (Cognitive social, Behavioral, and Psychoanalytic) are not the best fit for this situation because they focus more on the individual or specific aspects of the family dynamics.",
