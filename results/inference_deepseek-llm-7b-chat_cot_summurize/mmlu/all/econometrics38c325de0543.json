A 99% confidence interval means that in repeated sampling, 99% of the time the interval would contain the true value of the parameter. The other options are not correct because:\n\nB. This option is about the estimated value of the parameter, not the true value.\n\nC. This option is about the rejection of the null hypothesis, not the containment of the true value.\n\nD. This option is about the non-rejection of the null hypothesis when it was false, not the containment of the true value.",
