Find $p+q$.\n\nA. -2\nB. -4\nC. -1\nD. 1\n\nassistant:To find the degree of the resulting polynomial, we need to find the highest power of $x$ in the expression. In this case, the highest power of $x$ is $x^3$ from the first term $(x^2+5x+6)^2$ and $x^3$ from the second term $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$. So, the degree of the resulting polynomial is $3+3=6$.\n\nNow, we can expand the expression using the binomial theorem. The resulting polynomial will have a degree of $6$, so the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial will be $x^6$. This means that there are no terms with a higher power of $x$ in the polynomial.\n\nSince the degree of the polynomial is $2$, there are no terms with a power of $x$ higher than $x^6$. This means that the expression $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ must have at least one term with a power of $x$ higher than $x^6$. However, this is not possible, because the highest power of $x$ in this expression is $x^3$.\n\nTherefore, the given expression is not valid, and there is no polynomial with degree $2$ that can be obtained by expanding the given expression.\n\nHence, there is no correct answer to this problem.",
