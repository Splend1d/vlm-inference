High density lipoprotein\nB. HMG-CoA reductase\nC. Low density lipoprotein\nD. Low density lipoprotein receptor\n\nassistant:Familial hypercholesterolaemia is caused by mutations in the gene which encodes (D) Low density lipoprotein receptor.\n\nStep 1: Understand the user's question\nThe user is asking about the gene responsible for Familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant information\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of cholesterol. It is caused by mutations in the LDLR (Low density lipoprotein receptor) gene.\n\nStep 3: Provide the correct answer\nBased on the information, the correct answer is (D) Low density lipoprotein receptor.",
