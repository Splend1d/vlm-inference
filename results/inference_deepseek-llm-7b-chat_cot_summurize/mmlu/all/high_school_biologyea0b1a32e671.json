You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: You are told that in a population of guinea pigs, 4 percent are black (recessive) and 96 percent are brown. Which of the following is the frequency of the heterozygous condition?\n\nA. 16 percent\nB. 32 percent\nC. 40 percent\nD. 48 percent\n\nassistant:To determine the frequency of the heterozygous condition, we first need to understand the concept of dominance in genetics. In this case, the black guinea pig (homozygous recessive) is the dominant allele, and the brown guinea pig (homozygous dominant) is the recessive allele.\n\nLet's denote the brown guinea pig as B and the black guinea pig as b. The population consists of 4 percent black guinea pigs (b) and 96 percent brown guinea pigs (B). The heterozygous guinea pig will have one black allele (b) and one brown allele (B).\n\nNow, let's find the probability of a guinea pig being heterozygous. We can do this by using the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event occurring is the sum of the probabilities of all possible scenarios that lead to the event.\n\nLet P(het) be the probability of a guinea pig being heterozygous. Then, we have:\n\nP(het) = P(het|b) * P(b) + P(het|B) * P(B)\n\nWe know that P(b) = 0.04 (4 percent of guinea pigs are black) and P(B) = 0.96 (96 percent of guinea pigs are brown). We also need to find P(het|b) and P(het|B).\n\nFor the heterozygous guinea pig to be black (bB), the brown guinea pig must be homozygous dominant (BB). The probability of this happening is P(BB) = 0.96 * (0.96 / 1) = 0.9216.\n\nFor the heterozygous guinea pig to be brown (Bb), the black guinea pig must be homozygous recessive (bb). The probability of this happening is P(bb) = 0.04 * (0.01 / 1) = 0.0004.\n\nNow, we can calculate P(het|b) and P(het|B):\n\nP(het|b) = P(bB) = 0.9216\nP(het|B) = P(Bb) = 0.0004\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of a guinea pig being heterozygous:\n\nP(het) = P(het|b) * P(b) + P(het|B) * P(B)\nP(het) = (0.9216 * 0.04) + (0.0004 * 0.96)\nP(het) = 0.03288 + 0.000384\nP(het) = 0.033264\n\nSince the probability must be a percentage, we can round the result to the nearest whole number:\n\nP(het) \u2248 0.0333\n\nThe frequency of the heterozygous condition in this population is approximately 3.33 percent, which corresponds to option C.",
