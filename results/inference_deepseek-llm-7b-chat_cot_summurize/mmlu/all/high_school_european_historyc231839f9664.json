In the Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels argue that the history of society is shaped by class struggles, and that the modern bourgeois society has created new classes and conditions of oppression, but has simplified the class antagonisms. They assert that the dominant class, the bourgeoisie, exploits the working class, the proletariat, and that the ultimate goal of history is the abolition of all classes and the establishment of a classless society. This perspective can be categorized as Materialism and economic determinism, which emphasizes the role of economic factors in shaping society and human history.",
