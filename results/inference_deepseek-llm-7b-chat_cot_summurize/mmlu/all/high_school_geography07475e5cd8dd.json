These hinterlands may include areas such as industrial parks, transportation hubs, and other places that are connected to the central city through economic and social ties.\n\nA is incorrect because it only includes the central city and its developed areas, which is a subset of the urban area. B is also incorrect because it includes the adjacent counties, which can be more than just the hinterlands of the central city. D is incorrect because it includes the adjacent counties, which can be more than just the hinterlands of the central city.",
