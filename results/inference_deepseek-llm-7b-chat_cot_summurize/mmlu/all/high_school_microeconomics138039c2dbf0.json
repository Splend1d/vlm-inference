In this case, the production possibility frontier will be a straight line because it represents the highest possible output that can be achieved with the given resources and technology. Efficiency is achieved when the inputs used to produce goods and services are used in the most productive way possible, resulting in the highest possible output.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the shape of the production possibility frontier. The goods on the axes are perfect substitutes in consumption when the two goods can be completely replaced by each other in consumption, but this does not affect the shape of the production possibility frontier. Utility is maximized when the consumer is satisfied with their consumption choices, but this is a matter of the consumer's satisfaction, not the shape of the production possibility frontier. Resources are not specialized when they are used to produce a variety of goods and services, but this also does not affect the shape of the production possibility frontier.",
