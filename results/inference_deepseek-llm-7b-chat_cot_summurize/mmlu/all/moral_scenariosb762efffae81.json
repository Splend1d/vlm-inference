Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in both scenarios does something that can be considered morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, the main character banishes their daughter to the basement for twenty years for being rude. This is a severe punishment and can be considered an abuse of power, as well as a violation of their daughter's rights. In Scenario 2, the main character starts a forest wildfire and burns some twigs and shrubs. This can be considered an environmental offense and a threat to the ecosystem.
