Francisco Pizarro and his Spanish forces conquered the Inca Empire in the 16th century, largely due to their superior numbers and weapons. The Incas had not faced a formidable enemy like the Spanish before, and their lack of experience in dealing with firearms and horses proved to be a significant disadvantage.\n\nPizarro's forces numbered around 168 men, while the Inca Empire had an estimated population of 6 million people. However, the Inca army was not well-organized or disciplined, and their fighting tactics were primarily based on hit-and-run attacks and guerrilla warfare.\n\nThe other options are not entirely accurate. While Pizarro's horses and guns were intimidating, they were not the sole reason for the Inca's defeat. Pizarro was not a brilliant military strategist, and his forces were not significantly larger than the Inca army. Additionally, the Incas had won the allegiance of many peoples they had conquered, but they were unable to maintain control over their vast empire due to the Spanish invasion.",
