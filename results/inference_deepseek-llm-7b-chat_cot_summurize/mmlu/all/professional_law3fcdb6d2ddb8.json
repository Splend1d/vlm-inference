A jury finding by a preponderance of the evidence.\nC. A judicial finding beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. A jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. A judicial finding by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nAccording to the state statute, the maximum punishment for assault increases to 10 years in prison if the defendant possessed a deadly weapon during the assault.

Therefore, the court must find that it is more likely true that the defendant possessed a deadly weapon by a preponderable of the evidence.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect because:\n\nB. A jury finding by a preponderance of the evidence: The statute does not require a jury finding for the maximum punishment to be imposed.\nC. A judicial finding beyond a reasonable doubt: This standard of proof is used in criminal cases to determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The statute does not require this level of proof for the maximum punishment to be imposed.\nD. A jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt: This standard of proof is used in criminal cases to determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The statute does not require this level of proof for the maximum punishment to be imposed.",
