HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2 can be used to make a buffer solution.\n\nBuffer solutions are substances that resist changes in pH when an acid or a base is added to them. They contain a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. In this case, HC2H3O2 is a weak acid (e.g., citric acid) and KC2H3O2 is its conjugate base (carboxylate ion). When a strong acid or strong base is added to the buffer solution, the weak acid will donate a proton (H+) to or accept a proton from the strong acid or strong base, respectively, maintaining the pH of the buffer solution relatively constant.",
