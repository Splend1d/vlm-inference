This is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character takes their baby's feet away so she can no longer dance. This action is morally wrong, as it deprives the baby of the ability to express themselves through movement, which is essential to their development and well-being.",
