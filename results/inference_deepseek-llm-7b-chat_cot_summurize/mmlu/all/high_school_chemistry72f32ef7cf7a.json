The bond length between any two nonmetal atoms is achieved under where the energy of interaction between the atoms is at its minimum value. This is known as the \"minimum energy bond\" or \"VSEPR bond.\" The VSEPR theory states that the electron pairs in a molecule will arrange themselves around the central atom in a way that minimizes the repulsive forces between them. The bond length between two nonmetal atoms is the shortest distance between the nuclei of the atoms. This is the point at which the attractive and repulsive forces between the two atoms are at their minimum value.",
