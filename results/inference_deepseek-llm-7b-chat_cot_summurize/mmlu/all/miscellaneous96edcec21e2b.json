However, I can provide some general information about blackjack.\n\nBlackjack is a card game that is played with one or more standard decks of 52 cards. In this game, each card has a value that corresponds to its rank (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) and suit (e.g. hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). The goal of the game is to get a hand value that is as close as possible to 21 without going over. The ace can be counted as 1 or 11, and the other cards have their face value.\n\nIn the case of the queen and the king, both cards are considered face cards. A queen has a value of 10, and a king also has a value of 10. When you combine their values, the total is 20. Therefore, the answer is C. 20.",
