These changes are best characterized as a decline in large mammal populations and relative increase in other classes of vertebrate species. This change in the ecosystem could have affected the hominids, who were likely to be scavengers or predators of small mammals, and forced them to adapt to new food sources or habitats. This could have been a significant factor in their evolution and eventual transition to modern humans.",
