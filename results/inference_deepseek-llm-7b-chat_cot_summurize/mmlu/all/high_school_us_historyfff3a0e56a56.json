The debate between exclusion and inclusion when it came to immigration policy.\nD. The debate between laissez-faire policies and government intervention in economic affairs.\n\nThe passage is a quote from Marcus Garvey in 1920, which discusses the cry for African unity and the desire for self-determination for people of African descent. This position aligns with the debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society. This debate was particularly relevant during the early 20th century, as the question of whether African Americans should seek full integration into American society or strive for greater separation and self-determination was a contentious issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society.",
