The poem \"Remember Sharpeville\" by Dennis Brutus is a powerful expression of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. The incident in Sharpeville, where police fired on a peaceful protest, became a symbol of the oppressive nature of apartheid and the determination of the people to resist it. Apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination that was in place in South Africa from 1948 to 1994, and it is the correct answer to this question.",
