Both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other.\n\nassistant:It is possible for there to be no perceived Doppler shift in situation (A) when the source travels toward the stationary detector. In this case, the source and detector are moving parallel to each other, and the relative speed between them is parallel to the direction of the wave propagation. Since the wave is not being compressed or stretched along its direction of travel, there is no change in frequency, and therefore no Doppler shift is perceived.",
