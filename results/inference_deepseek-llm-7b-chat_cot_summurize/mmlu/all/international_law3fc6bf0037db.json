The local remedies rule aims to free up international tribunals to deal with the most serious cases\nB. The local remedies rule aims to dissuade applicants abusing the system from filing unnecessary petitions\nC. The local remedies rule aims on the one hand to restrict the volume of petitions to international tribunals while at the same time building up the capacity of local courts\nD. The local remedies rule helps demonstrate that national courts are always better placed than international ones to deal with cases\n\nassistant:The rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies in international human rights is primarily based on the principle of national sovereignty and the need to encourage states to address human rights issues within their own legal systems. This principle, also known as the doctrine of compulsory jurisdiction, requires individuals to exhaust all available domestic remedies before seeking international redress.\n\nThe primary rationale behind this doctrine can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Conservation of resources: The exhaustion of local remedies helps conserve the limited resources available in international human rights bodies. By requiring individuals to first seek relief through their home country's legal system, the doctrine encourages states to address human rights issues within their own legal frameworks. This can prevent the overloading of international tribunals with cases that could have been resolved locally.\n\n2. Promotion of national judicial systems: The exhaustion of local remedies is designed to promote the development and functioning of national judicial systems. By requiring individuals to use their own courts, the doctrine incentivizes states to strengthen and improve their domestic human rights protections. This can lead to better understanding of human rights issues and their resolution within the domestic legal framework.\n\n3. Encouraging state accountability: The exhaustion of local remedies also serves to encourage states to take responsibility for addressing human rights violations within their own legal systems. By providing an avenue for individuals to seek relief through their home country's courts, the doctrine emphasizes the importance of state accountability and the need for states to address human rights issues within their own legal systems.\n\n4. Preservation of national legal traditions and cultural norms: The exhaustion of local remedies respects the diversity of national legal traditions and cultural norms by acknowledging that different societies may have unique approaches to addressing human rights issues. By requiring individuals to seek relief through their home country's courts, the doctrine preserves these differences and prevents international legal norms from becoming too standardized.\n\n5. Protection of national sovereignty: Finally, the exhaustion of local remedies is designed to protect national sovereignty. By encouraging states to address human rights issues within their own legal systems, the doctrine respects the principle that states should have control over their domestic affairs. This helps maintain a balance between international human rights obligations and national sovereignty.\n\nIn conclusion, the exhaustion of local remedies in international human rights is primarily motivated by the need to conserve resources, promote national judicial systems, encourage state accountability, preserve national legal traditions, and protect national sovereignty. By requiring individuals to exhaust all available domestic remedies, the doctrine encourages states to address human rights issues within their own legal frameworks, thereby promoting a more balanced and sustainable approach to human rights protection.",
