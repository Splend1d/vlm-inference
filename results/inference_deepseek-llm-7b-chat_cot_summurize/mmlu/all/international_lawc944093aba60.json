Collective security is a concept in international relations that refers to a group of nations agreeing to defend each other if one member of the group is attacked. This is different from individual or national self-defense, which is the right of each country to defend itself. Collective security is often associated with the United Nations and its Security Council, which has the authority to authorize the use of armed force in response to threats to international peace and security.",
