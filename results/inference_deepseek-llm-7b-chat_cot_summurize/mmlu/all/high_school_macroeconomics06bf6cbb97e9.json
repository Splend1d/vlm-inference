In order to restore equilibrium, the price level needs to adjust.\n\nOption B is incorrect because increasing supply without an increase in demand will only exacerbate the disequilibrium. Option C is also incorrect because decreasing demand will only deepen the disequilibrium. Option D is incorrect because decreasing supply will not address the imbalance in demand and supply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: prices will be driven upward to restore equilibrium. This is because as the price increases, the demand will decrease, and the supply will increase, until they meet at a new equilibrium point.",
