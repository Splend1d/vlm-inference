Historical distance to the brightest star Sirius.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. One parsec is defined as the distance at which an object would appear to have the same angular size as an object at the distance of one astronomical unit (the average distance from the Earth to the Sun) from the vantage point of a reference point on the Earth. This definition is based on the fact that light travels at a constant speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers per second (186,000 miles per second). Therefore, if an object is located at a distance of one astronomical unit from the Earth, it would appear to have an angular size of 1 arcsecond in the sky. The value of one parsec is approximately 3.26 light-years.",
