Tetrahedron\nB. Square planar\nC. Octahedron\nD. Square pyramid\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first identify the geometries of the given options and then determine which one has five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons.\n\n1. Tetrahedron: A tetrahedron has four planar faces, and the electron pairs are distributed in a way that creates four sigma bonds. It does not have a nonbonding pair of electrons.\n2. Square planar: A square planar molecule has four planar faces, and the electron pairs are distributed in a way that creates four sigma bonds. It also does not have a nonbonding pair of electrons.\n3. Octahedron: An octahedron has eight faces, and the electron pairs are distributed in a way that creates six sigma bonds. It does not have a nonbonding pair of electrons.\n4. Square pyramid: A square pyramid has a square planar face and a triangular base. It is similar to a square planar molecule, but the electron pairs are not arranged in the same way.\n\nBased on the given information, none of the geometries corresponds to a substance that has five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons.",
