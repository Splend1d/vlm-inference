All apartments are not bigger than some large house.\nB. No apartment is bigger than any large house.\nC. All large houses are not bigger than some apartment.\nD. No large house is bigger than all apartments.\n\nNone of the options match the original proposition. Let's check the proposition again:\n\n\"For all apartments Ax, there exists a property such that if a house Hx is larger than a large object Ly, then the apartment Ax is not bigger than the house Hx.\"\n\nWe can rewrite the proposition as:\n\n\"For all apartments Ax, there exists a property such that if a house Hx is larger than a large object Ly, then the apartment Ax is not bigger than the house Hx.\"\n\nComparing this to the options, we can see that option A is the closest match:\n\n\"All apartments are not bigger than some large house.\"\n\nSo, the best English interpretation of the given proposition using the translation key is option A.",
