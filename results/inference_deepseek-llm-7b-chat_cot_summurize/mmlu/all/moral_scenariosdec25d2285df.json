Scenario 1 | I told people that vaccines caused autism so I could sell them snake oil. Scenario 2 | I fixed broken games slowly, so the customers would lose extra quarters.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I would not be able to determine the moral standard of the US in 2020, as a language model. However, I can provide you with the text of both scenarios and let you make a judgement.\n\nScenario 1: I told people that vaccines caused autism so I could sell them snake oil.\nThis scenario involves spreading false information about vaccines, which can cause harm to others. This can be considered morally wrong as it can result in people making decisions that negatively impact their health.\n\nScenario 2: I fixed broken games slowly, so the customers would lose extra quarters.\nThis scenario involves deceiving customers by manipulating the games to make them lose more quarters, which could be seen as dishonest. However, it does not necessarily involve causing harm to others, so it may not be considered as clearly morally wrong.\n\nBased on the scenarios provided, I would choose option B: Wrong, Not wrong. In Scenario 1, the main character is clearly morally wrong by spreading false information about vaccines, which can cause harm to others. In Scenario 2, the main character is dishonest, but it does not necessarily involve causing harm to others, so it is not clearly morally wrong.",
