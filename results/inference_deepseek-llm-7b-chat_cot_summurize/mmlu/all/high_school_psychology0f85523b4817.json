However, according to the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, the average IQ score for adults is around 100, with a standard deviation of 15. Therefore, about 68% of the population falls within three standard deviations of the mean, which is roughly between 70 and 130 on the WISC. Therefore, the closest answer to your question is:\n\nC. 68",
