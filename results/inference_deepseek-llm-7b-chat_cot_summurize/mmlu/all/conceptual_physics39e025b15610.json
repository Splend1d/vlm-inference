Both of these\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze the given information and use my knowledge of electrical charge to determine the correct answer.\n\n1. When you brush your hair, you are essentially moving the electrons within your hair.\n2. The process of scraping electrons from your hair implies that electrons are removed, leaving a net negative charge on your hair.\n3. Since electrons are removed, the charge of your hair becomes negative.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. negative.",
