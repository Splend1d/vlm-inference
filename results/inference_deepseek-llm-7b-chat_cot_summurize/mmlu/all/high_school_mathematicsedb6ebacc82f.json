At high tide today at 8 A.M., the water level was 15 feet; at low tide, 6 hours later at 2 P.M., it was 3 feet. How fast, in feet per hour, was the water level dropping at noon today?\n\nA. 3\nB. \u03c0\\sqrt{3}/2\nC. 3\\sqrt{3}\nD. \u03c0\\sqrt{3}\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the sinusoidal equation to describe the relationship between the water level and time.\n\nLet's denote the water level at time t as L(t). Since the water level varies sinusoidally, we can write the equation as:\n\nL(t) = A * sin(B * t + C)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nWe are given that the water level was 15 feet at high tide (8 A.M.) and 3 feet at low tide (2 P.M.). We can use these values to find the amplitude (A), phase shift (C), and angular frequency (B).\n\nAt high tide (8 A.M.), the water level was 15 feet. Since the amplitude is the maximum value of the sinusoidal function, we can write:\n\n15 = A * sin(C)\n\nAt low tide (2 P.M.), the water level was 3 feet. Since the amplitude is the maximum value of the sinusoidal function, we can write:\n\n3 = A * sin(C + B * 6)\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find the amplitude (A) and phase shift (C).\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\nA = 15 / sin(C)\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n3 = (15 / sin(C)) * sin(C + B * 6)\n\nNow, let's solve for B. We can use the fact that the amplitude is half the period of the sinusoidal function. Therefore, the period of the sinusoidal function is:\n\nT = 2 * \u03c0 / B\n\nSince the water level changed from 15 feet to 3 feet in 6 hours, the period is 6 hours. Therefore, we have:\n\n2 * \u03c0 / B = 6\n\nB = (2 * \u03c0) / 6\n\nB = \u03c0 / 3\n\nNow, let's find the phase shift (C). We can use the fact that the phase shift is half the argument of the sinusoidal function. Therefore, the argument of the sinusoidal function is:\n\nD = C + B * T\n\nSince the amplitude is half the period of the sinusoidal function, we have:\n\nD = C + \u03c0 / 3\n\nNow, let's find C. We can use the fact that the water level was 15 feet at high tide (8 A.M.) and 3 feet at low tide (2 P.M.). Since the phase shift is half the argument of the sinusoidal function, we can write:\n\nC = (D - 15) / 2\n\nC = ((C + \u03c0 / 3) - 15) / 2\n\nC = (\u03c0 / 3 - 15) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the velocity (A / B). The velocity is the derivative of the sinusoidal function with respect to time. Therefore, we have:\n\nv = A / B\n\nv = (15 / sin(C)) / (\u03c0 / 3)\n\nv = (15 / sin(C)) * (3 / \u03c0)\n\nNow, let's find the velocity at noon (12 P.M.). Since the period is 6 hours, the water level will return to 3 feet after 6 hours. Therefore, we have:\n\nL(12) = 3\n\nL(12) = 3 * sin(C)\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for v, we get:\n\nv = (15 / sin(C)) * (3 / \u03c0)\n\nv = (15 / sin(C)) * (3\u03c0 / 3)\n\nv = (15 * 3\u03c0) / (3 * sin(C))\n\nv = 15 * \u03c0 / sin(C)\n\nNow, let's find the velocity at noon (12 P.M.). Since the phase shift is half the argument of the sinusoidal function, we can write:\n\nC = (D - 3) / 2\n\nC = ((\u03c0 / 3 - 15) / 2) - 3\n\nC = (\u03c0 / 3 - 15) - 6\n\nC = (\u03c0 / 3 - 21)\n\nNow, let's find the velocity at noon (12 P.M.). Since the phase shift is half the argument of the sinusoidal function, we can write:\n\nv = 15 * \u03c0 / sin(C)\n\nv = 15 * \u03c0 /",
