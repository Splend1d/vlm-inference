The rounded number of runners is 400. Which number could be the actual number of runners at the track meet?\n\nA. 382\nB. 397\nC. 406\nD. 447\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the equation:\n\nRounded number of runners = actual number of runners * 10/9\n\nwhere Rounded number is 400, actual number is x, and 10/9 is the ratio of rounding to the nearest 10.\n\n400 = x * 10/9\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9/10:\n\n(9/10) * 400 = (9/10) * (x * 10/9)\n\n360 = x\n\nSo the actual number of runners at the track meet is 360. However, we need to find the option that matches this value. We can see that option C (406) is the closest to 360. Therefore, the answer is C.",
