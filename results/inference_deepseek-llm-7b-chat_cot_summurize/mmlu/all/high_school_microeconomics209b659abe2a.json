Price rises as firms enter the industry.\nB. Market equilibrium quantity rises as firms exit the industry.\nC. Nothing. The industry is currently in long-run equilibrium.\nD. Price falls as firms enter the industry.\n\nassistant:The perfectly competitive price is currently above minimum ATC, which means that the current price is greater than the minimum average total cost (ATC) for each firm in the industry. In the long run, we can expect the following events to occur:\n\nA. Price rises as firms enter the industry.\n\nThis is because, in a perfectly competitive market, new firms will enter the market as the price is above the minimum ATC, and they will try to capture the profit by lowering the price. This will cause the price to fall, leading to a downward pressure on the price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Price rises as firms enter the industry.",
