This means that biocentrists believe that all living beings have inherent value and deserve protection and respect. This contrasts with anthropocentrism, which prioritizes the interests and values of human beings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that only human beings possess direct moral standing, which is not biocentric.\nOption B is partially correct, but it only applies to sentient creatures, not all living beings.\nOption D is also partially correct, but it only applies to ecosystems, not all living beings.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C: all living beings, because they are living, possess direct moral standing.",
