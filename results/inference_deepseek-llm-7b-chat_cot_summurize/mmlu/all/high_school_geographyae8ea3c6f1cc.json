UN\nB. NATO\nC. ASEAN\nD. PLO\n\nassistant:B. NATO is NOT a supranational organization.\n\nA supranational organization is a type of international organization that has a certain level of autonomy from its member states and is able to make decisions and enforce rules on its own. The United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) are examples of supranational organizations.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a military alliance that was established in 1949 to provide a collective defense against potential threats from outside the member states. NATO is not a supranational organization because it is not able to make decisions or enforce rules on its own. Instead, decisions are made by consensus among the member states, and NATO does not have the power to enforce its decisions on its member states.\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is also not a supranational organization. While it does have a certain level of unity and cooperation among its member states, it does not have the power to make decisions or enforce rules on its own. ASEAN is more of a regional organization that promotes cooperation and integration among its member states, but it does not have the same level of autonomy as a supranational organization.\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is not a supranational organization because it is a political organization that seeks to promote the interests of the Palestinian people. While it does have a certain level of unity and cooperation among its member organizations, it does not have the power to make decisions or enforce rules on its own.",
