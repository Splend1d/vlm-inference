State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that no state shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" This means that states cannot discriminate against individuals based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or age. The law in question appears to be discriminatory in nature, as it only applies to children who have not lived in the state for at least one year, and does not affect children who have lived in the state for at least one year. This could be seen as a form of discrimination, and therefore, it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The one-year residence requirement is valid because it does not affect any fundamental right or suspect class. This statement is incorrect because the Fourteenth Amendment does not allow for discrimination based on residency status.\n\nB. State durational residence requirements that are established for publicly funded services are constitutional because they relate to government operations reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment. This statement is also incorrect because the Tenth Amendment does not provide a basis for discriminating against children based on their residency status.\n\nC. Because publicly funded education is a fundamental constitutional right, a state may not deny it to any class of persons who reside in that state. This statement is incorrect because the Fourteenth Amendment does not guarantee a right to public education. While public education is a valuable resource, it is not a fundamental constitutional right.",
