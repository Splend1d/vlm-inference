Irreversible inhibition.\n\nWhen DFP binds to ACE, the ACE enzyme is permanently inactivated, making it unable to perform its function of breaking down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction. This irreversible inactivation of ACE by DFP is a characteristic of irreversible inhibition.",
