Last week he examined the teeth of five unrelated children younger than 10. Let X be the number of children who develop cavities before turning 10. Which of the following gives the probability that at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10?\n\nA. P(X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\nB. P(X = 2 out of 7)\nC. P(X = 1)\nD. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0)\n\nassistant:Let's use the complement rule to find the probability that at least one child develops a cavity before turning 10. The complement rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nThe event that at least one child develops a cavity before turning 10 is the complement of the event that none of the children develop cavities before turning 10.\n\nThe probability that none of the five children develop cavities before turning 10 is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(5, 0) * p^0 * (1-p)^5\n       = 1 * 1^0 * (0.2)^5\n       = 0.0000004\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(at least one child develops a cavity) = 1 - P(none of the children develop cavities)\n                                       = 1 - P(X = 0)\n                                       = 1 - 0.0000004\n                                       = 0.9999996\n\nSo, the probability that at least one child develops a cavity before turning 10 is approximately 0.9999996.\n\nThe answer is: 0.9999996",
