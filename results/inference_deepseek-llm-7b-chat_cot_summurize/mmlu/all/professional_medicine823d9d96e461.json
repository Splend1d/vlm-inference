Release of thromboxane\nD. Separation of endothelial junctions\n\nassistant:The most likely primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient is B. Increased hydrostatic pressure. The patient's arm has experienced trauma, leading to inflammation and edema, which can be explained by the body's response to injury. When the body detects an injury, it sends blood vessels to the affected area to help with the healing process. This increased blood flow can lead to an increase in hydrostatic pressure, causing fluid to leak into the surrounding tissues and leading to swelling.",
