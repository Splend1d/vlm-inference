The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.\n\nassistant:B. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\n\nIn this case, the offeree never actually accepted the offer as stated. The offeree only sent a notification that they had received the offer, but they did not agree to the specified terms. When the offeror shipped the goods, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms, but these modifications were not in line with the original offer. This means that the offeree did not accept the offer on the same terms specified, and therefore, they are not in breach of contract.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The posting of the acceptance form did not finalize a contract between the parties because the offeree did not agree to the same terms as specified in the original offer.\n\nC. The offeror shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance, but this does not mean that a contract was formed. The offeree never agreed to the same terms as specified, so there was no binding contract.\n\nD. The offeree did call the offeror's manager and rejected the offer, but this does not mean that they are in breach of contract. They never accepted the offer on the same terms specified, so they were not in breach of contract when they rejected it.",
