The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\nC. The landscaper's promise was voidable, since it was not in writing.\nD. The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.\n\nassistant:The probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard is A. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract. A unilateral contract is a contract that is offered by one party (the promisee) to another party (the promisor) in the expectation that the promisor will perform some action or take some specific step to fulfill the contract. In this case, the homeowner offered to pay the landscaper $10,000 if the landscaper completed the work on the backyard by May 1, as agreed upon in the existing contract. The landscaper's promise to complete the work is a promise to fulfill the terms of the contract, and therefore creates an enforceable unilateral contract.\n\nIt is worth noting that, while a unilateral contract is enforceable, it may be subject to certain limitations. For example, if the promise to pay is conditioned on an event that is unlikely to occur, the contract may be deemed voidable or unenforceable. In this case, however, the promise to pay is contingent on the landscaper completing the work, which is a reasonable and achievable goal. Therefore, the contract is likely to be enforceable.\n\nIn conclusion, the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard, as agreed upon in the existing contract, creates an enforceable unilateral contract.",
