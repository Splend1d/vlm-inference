The eastward expansion of Russia\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico\n\nassistant:The development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate.\n\nBefore the Tokugawa Shogunate was established in 1603, Japan had been closed to foreign trade since the 13th century. This isolationist policy was enforced by the Japanese government to protect their culture and economy from foreign influences. The Portuguese, who were the main traders in the Far East during the period 1450-1750, had to trade with the Chinese and not the Japanese, as mentioned in the passage.\n\nHowever, in 1637, the Tokugawa Shogunate, under the leadership of Ieyasu Tokugawa, established a policy of \"sakoku,\" or \"closed country,\" which completely closed Japan to foreign trade for over 250 years. This policy directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the passage, as it effectively ended the Portuguese's ability to trade with Japan.\n\nThe other options are not as directly related to the trade patterns in the passage. The eastward expansion of Russia, the Portuguese conquest of India, and the Spanish conquest of Mexico all took place before 1450, and thus were not responsible for the trade patterns mentioned in the passage.",
