The arson charge is justified because the defendant intentionally threw his cigarette butt into the trash can, which led to the small fire. The burglary charge is justified because the defendant broke into the bar, which is a business structure, and stole large kegs of beer. The other options are incorrect because they either include unrelated crimes (larceny) or additional crimes that were not committed by the defendant (robbery).",
