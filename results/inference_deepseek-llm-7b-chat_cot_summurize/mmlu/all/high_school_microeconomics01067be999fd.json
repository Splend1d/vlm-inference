David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours. Which of the following statements is true about the transaction above:\n\nA. Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by between $50 and $75.\nB. Producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75.\nC. Consumer surplus is greater than producer surplus by more than $75.\nD. The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the transaction step by step:\n\n1. Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, and tutors David for two hours.\n   Total value of tutoring for Elsa: $50/hour * 2 hours = $100\n\n2. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring.\n   David's surplus for the transaction: $175 - $100 = $75\n\n3. They negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours.\n   Total value of tutoring for Elsa: $125\n   Consumer surplus for David: $125 - $100 = $25\n   Producer surplus for Elsa: $100 - $125 = -$25\n\n4. Calculate the difference between consumer and producer surplus:\n   Consumer surplus - Producer surplus = $75 - $25 = $50\n\nSince the difference between consumer and producer surplus is $50, the statement B. Producer surplus is greater than consumer surplus by between $50 and $75 is true. Therefore, the answer is B.",
