In the case of a tree branch, the branch is considered to be a spring, and the force exerted on it is the weight of the object being suspended from it.\n\nIf you hang by a tree branch and note how much it bends, the force exerted on the branch is proportional to the weight of the object being suspended. If you hang by a branch with twice the weight, the branch will bend twice as much as it did when you hung it with the original weight. Therefore, the correct answer is A. half the bend.",
