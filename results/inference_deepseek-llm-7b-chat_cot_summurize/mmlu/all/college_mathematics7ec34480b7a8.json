Statement 2 | There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence.\n\nA. True, True\nB. True, False\nC. False, True\nD.

This statement is true. The limit of a sequence {s_n} converging to a complex number s means that for every neighborhood of s, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, s_n is in that neighborhood. This implies that s_nt_n is also a sequence of complex numbers that converges to st.\n\nStatement 2: There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. This statement is also true. An example of such a sequence is the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is bounded by the integers 0 and 1, and yet it has no convergent subsequence. This is because every subsequence either increases without bound or oscillates between two values without converging.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, and the correct answer is A.
