The integers under addition\nB. The nonzero integers under multiplication\nC. The nonzero real numbers under multiplication\nD. The complex numbers under addition\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze the given options and determine which one is not a group according to the definition of a group in mathematics.\n\nA group is a set of elements (called \"elements\" or \"permutations\") together with an operation (called \"operation\" or \"permutation\") that combines any two of its elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called the group axioms are satisfied. These conditions are:\n1. Closure: The operation must be closed, meaning that the result of any combination of two elements must be another element of the set.\n2. Associativity: The operation must be associative, meaning that the order in which the operation is performed does not affect the result.\n3. Identity element: There must exist an element that, when combined with any other element using the operation, leaves the other element unchanged.\n4. Inverse element: Each element must have an inverse that, when combined with the element using the operation, results in the identity element.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The integers under addition: This is a group because the addition operation is closed, associative, has an identity element (0), and each integer has an inverse (except for negative integers).\n\nB. The nonzero integers under multiplication: This is also a group because the multiplication operation is closed, associative, has an identity element (1), and each nonzero integer has an inverse (the reciprocal).\n\nD. The complex numbers under addition: This is a group because the addition operation is closed, associative, has an identity element (0+0i), and each complex number has an inverse (the complex conjugate).\n\nC. The nonzero real numbers under multiplication: This is not a group because the multiplication operation is not associative. For example, consider the numbers 1, 2, and 3. According to the multiplication operation, their product is 6. However, if we consider the numbers as vectors, their product would be (1, 2, 3)T * (1, 2, 3) = (1*1+2*2+3*3, 1*1+2*2+3*3, 1*1+2*2+3*3) = (7, 11, 15), which is not equal to 6. This shows that the multiplication operation is not closed, which is a violation of the group axioms.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. The nonzero real numbers under multiplication are not a group.",
