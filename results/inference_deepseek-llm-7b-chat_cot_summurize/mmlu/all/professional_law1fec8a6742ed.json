On August 1, the widower handed his friend a deed conveying the quarry to his niece and said to the friend, \"Give this to my niece. \" Unknown to the widower, the niece was in Africa. The next week, the friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. One month later, the widower died, and in his will he devised the quarry to his daughter. Thereafter, the niece returned from Africa, and a dispute arose between the niece and the daughter regarding ownership of the quarry. In a suit to quiet title to the quarry, the court ruled in favor of the niece. The ruling was most likely based upon which of the following?\n\nA. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\nB. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\nC. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.\nD. The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\n\n\"Causa Mortis\" is a legal concept that allows a person to make a gift of their property while they are dying, which is effective immediately upon the person's death. In this case, the widower was able to make a gift of the quarry to his niece by handing the deed to his friend, which was recorded with the Recorder's Office. This gift was effective immediately upon the widower's death, even though the niece was not present to receive it.\n\nTherefore, the court's ruling in favor of the niece was based on the fact that there was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift made by the widower to his niece. The other options are not relevant to the legal concept of \"causa mortis\" and are therefore incorrect.",
