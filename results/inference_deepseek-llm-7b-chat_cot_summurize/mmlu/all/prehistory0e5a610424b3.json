I found that Yok Balum Cave is located in the Maya homeland, and the oxygen isotopes in its stalagmite can provide information about the amount of rainfall in the region.\n\nAccording to the information I found, increased rainfall in the Maya homeland led to severe flooding that caused the collapse of several Maya ceremonial centers. This matches option A, which is the correct answer.",
