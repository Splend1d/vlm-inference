The chemical colchicine prevents the assembly of microtubules by binding to tubulin protein subunits. Which of the following cellular processes would be most impaired by the application of colchicine?\n\nA. the alignment and separation of chromosomes during mitosis\nB. the coordination of ribosomes and mRNA during protein synthesis\nC. the movement of substances across the plasma membrane\nD. the accumulation of protons inside the thylakoids of chloroplasts during chemiosmosis\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. the alignment and separation of chromosomes during mitosis.\n\nColchicine prevents the assembly of microtubules, which are essential for the alignment and separation of chromosomes during mitosis. This process would be most impaired by the application of colchicine, as it affects the microtubules that help separate chromosomes during cell division.\n\nOption B is incorrect because colchicine does not affect the coordination of ribosomes and mRNA during protein synthesis. Option C is incorrect because colchicine does not affect the movement of substances across the plasma membrane. Option D is incorrect because colchicine does not affect the accumulation of protons inside the thylakoids of chloroplasts during chemiosmosis.",
