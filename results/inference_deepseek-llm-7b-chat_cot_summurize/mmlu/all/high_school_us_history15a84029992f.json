The Apollo space program\nD. The Great Society social programs\n\nassistant:Kennedy's speech most directly led to the Apollo space program. In the speech, he announced the United States' intention to send a manned mission to the moon within the decade and to achieve other goals in the process. This goal was seen as a way to organize and measure the best of the nation's energies and skills, and to demonstrate its technological prowess. The Apollo program was launched in response to Kennedy's challenge, and the United States achieved the goal of landing a man on the moon in 1969. While the speech may have had some indirect effects on other areas of U.S. policy, such as the development of missile defense systems and the space race with the Soviet Union, it is most directly associated with the Apollo space program.",
