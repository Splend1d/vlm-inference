Since the strip is made of a continuous piece of iron, the length and width will both increase as the temperature rises. The third option, \"may increase and may decrease,\" is incorrect because increasing the temperature will always result in an increase in length and width. The fourth option, \"decreases in width as it gets longer,\" is also incorrect because the iron strip will expand in both length and width as the temperature rises.",
