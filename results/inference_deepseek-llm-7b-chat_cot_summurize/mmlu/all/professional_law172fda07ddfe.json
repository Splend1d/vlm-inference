The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.\nB. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.\nC. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\nD. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.\n",

In the United States, slander per Se refers to a statement that by its very nature is considered harmful to the reputation of the person being defamed, and does not require proof of actual harm.\n\nThe telephone operator's erroneous identification was not slander per Se. While the operator's mistake did cause the boyfriend to lose his job and suffer embarrassment in the community, this is not enough to make it slander per Se. The boyfriend's defamation action would most likely fail because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\n\nActual malice refers to knowledge that what is being said is false or reckless disregard for the truth. In this case, the operator made the identification based on what they believed to be true at the time, so it does not meet the criteria for actual malice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. The boyfriend will most likely not succeed in his defamation action against the telephone operator and the telephone company.",
