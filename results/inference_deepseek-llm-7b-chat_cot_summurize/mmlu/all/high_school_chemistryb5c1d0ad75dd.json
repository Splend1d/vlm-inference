If 10.0 grams of BrCl is initially present in a 15.0-liter reaction vessel, what will the concentration of BrCl be at equilibrium?\n\nA. 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L\nB. 5.77 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L\nC. 1.97 \u00d7 10^-3 M\nD. 9.9 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n\nassistant:The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between Br2(g) and Cl2(g) to form BrCl(g) is:\n\nBr2(g) + Cl2(g) \u2192 2 BrCl(g)\n\nThe equilibrium constant, K, can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nK = [BrCl]^2 * [Cl2] / ([Br2] * [BrCl])\n\nwhere [BrCl] is the concentration of BrCl, [Cl2] is the concentration of Cl2, and [Br2] is the concentration of Br2.\n\nWe are given that the initial concentration of BrCl is 10.0 grams (or 1.97 \u00d7 10^-2 mol) and the initial volume of the reaction vessel is 15.0 L. Since we are asked for the concentration at equilibrium, we can use the equilibrium constant, K, to find the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium.\n\nK = (1.97 \u00d7 10^-2 mol/L)^2 * (x mol/L) / (1.97 \u00d7 10^-2 mol/L * (1.97 \u00d7 10^-2 mol/L))\n\nx = K * (1.97 \u00d7 10^-2 mol/L)^2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 15.0 L * (1.97 \u00d7 10^-2 mol/L)^2 * (1 mol/15.0 L)^(-1)\nx = 1.97 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium is 1.97 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L, which corresponds to option B.",
