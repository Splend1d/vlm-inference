An integrated test facility that verifies the accuracy of data.\nB. A heuristic program that accesses remote locations.\nC. Hardware security modules that store sensitive data.\nD. Computer activity logs that indicate failed transactions.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Computer activity logs that indicate failed transactions.\n\nAn audit trail in an EDI system is essential for tracking and recording all transactions and activities. This helps to ensure that the system is functioning as intended, and any issues or errors can be identified and resolved. Computer activity logs that indicate failed transactions are an important part of an audit trail because they allow administrators to see which transactions have failed and why, and take corrective action as necessary.\n\nOption A, an integrated test facility that verifies the accuracy of data, is not an essential element of the audit trail in an EDI system. While this type of facility can be useful for testing and verifying data, it is not necessary for tracking and recording transactions.\n\nOption B, a heuristic program that accesses remote locations, is also not an essential element of the audit trail. While such a program could be useful for automating certain tasks, it is not specifically related to the tracking and recording of transactions.\n\nOption C, hardware security modules that store sensitive data, is not directly related to the audit trail. While it is important to protect sensitive data, the audit trail itself is not responsible for storing this data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Computer activity logs that indicate failed transactions are an essential element of the audit trail in an EDI system.",
