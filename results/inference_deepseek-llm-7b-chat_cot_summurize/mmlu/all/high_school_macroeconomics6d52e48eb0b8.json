The GDP in 2005 is calculated based on the final goods and services produced and consumed in that year. Since the computers were not sold in 2005, they did not contribute to the production or consumption of goods and services in that year. Therefore, the GDP in 2005 remains the same.\n\nHowever, when the computers are sold in 2006, they will contribute to the GDP in 2006 because they will be counted as part of the final goods and services produced and consumed in that year. The wholesale value of the computers (which is likely to be higher than the retail value) will be included in the GDP calculation for 2006.",
