The width of the yard is 55 feet and the lengthis 75 feet. How manyfeet of fencing does Mr. Fuller need?\n\nA. 130\nB. 260\nC. 3,905\nD. 4,125\n\nassistant:To find the amount of fencing needed for Mr. Fuller's yard, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular yard. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + width).\n\nFirst, let's find the length and width of the rectangular yard:\nLength = 75 feet\nWidth = 55 feet\n\nNow, let's use the formula to find the perimeter:\nPerimeter = 2(75 + 55)\nPerimeter = 2(130)\nPerimeter = 260 feet\n\nSo, Mr. Fuller needs 260 feet of fencing for his rectangular yard. The correct answer is option B.",
