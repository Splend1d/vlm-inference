The user wants to know the status of the inverted U hypothesis, a conjecture about the relationship between development and inequality, as of 2020.\n\nLet's go through each option:\n\nA. Strongly supported by most studies: This option suggests that most studies have found evidence to support the inverted U hypothesis. This could be the correct answer if it is the case that most studies have indeed found evidence to support the hypothesis.\n\nB. Supported mainly by cross-section, not time-series studies: This option specifies the type of studies that support the hypothesis. Cross-section studies examine a single point in time, while time-series studies examine the trend over time. If most studies that support the hypothesis are of this type, this could be the correct answer.\n\nC. Supported mainly by time-series, not cross-section studies: Similar to option B, this option specifies the type of studies that support the hypothesis. If most studies that support the hypothesis are of this type, this could be the correct answer.\n\nD. Generally repudiated by empirical studies: This option suggests that most studies have found evidence to disprove the inverted U hypothesis. This could be the correct answer if it is the case that most studies have indeed found evidence to disprove the hypothesis.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, none of them clearly indicate that the inverted U hypothesis has been strongly supported by most studies. Option B and C seem to be more specific about the type of studies supporting the hypothesis, while option D suggests that the hypothesis has been disproven. However, none of the options provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the correct answer with the given information.",
