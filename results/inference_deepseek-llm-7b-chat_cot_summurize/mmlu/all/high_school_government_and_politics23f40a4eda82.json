This power is not explicitly granted to Congress in the United States Constitution, but is instead inferred from the document's structure and the general welfare clause. This power allows Congress to create laws that regulate business activities that occur across state lines, such as pricing and product safety.\n\nBorrowing money on the credit of the United States is not an example of an implied power of the Congress. This power is explicitly granted to Congress by Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.\n\nC. oversight of executive branch agencies is also not an example of an implied power of the Congress. This power is explicitly granted to Congress by Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.\n\nD. declarations of war is also not an example of an implied power of the Congress. This power is explicitly granted to Congress by Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. regulation of interstate commerce.",
