So, this could be a valid triangle.\n\nB. 5, 5: The sum of the sides is 10, which is equal to the longest side. So, this could be a valid triangle.\n\nC. 3, 9: The sum of the sides is 12, which is greater than 10. So, this could be a valid triangle.\n\nD. 9, 8: The sum of the sides is 17, which is greater than 10. So, this could be a valid triangle.\n\nNone of the options could NOT be the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, the answer is None of the above.",
