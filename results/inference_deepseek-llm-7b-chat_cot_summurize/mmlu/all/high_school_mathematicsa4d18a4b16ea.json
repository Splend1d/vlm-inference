The salesman wants to sell Zoey as many bricks as possible to cover her patio with a thickness of one brick, while not having any extra bricks. The patio area is a rectangle with dimensions 12 feet by 10 feet, and each individual brick is 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches. What would be the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell to meet his sales criteria?\n\nA. 5,760\nB. 2,880\nC. 2,160\nD. 1,440\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total area of the patio, and then divide that area by the area of each brick to find the number of bricks needed to cover the patio. If the number of bricks is a whole number, then it meets the salesman's criteria.\n\nThe area of the patio is 12 feet x 10 feet = 120 square feet.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of each brick. We can convert the dimensions of the brick to feet:\n\n4 inches = 4/12 feet = 1/3 feet\n6 inches = 6/12 feet = 1/2 feet\n2 inches = 2/12 feet = 1/6 feet\n\nThe total area of one brick is (1/3) feet x (1/2) feet x (1/6) feet = 1/36 square feet.\n\nTo find the number of bricks needed to cover the patio, we divide the area of the patio by the area of one brick:\n\n120 square feet / (1/36 square feet) = 120 * 36 = 4,320 bricks\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a brick, we need to round down to the nearest whole number:\n\n4,320 bricks \u2192 4,320 / 4,320 = 1\n\nThe greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell to meet the sales criteria is 1 brick, which corresponds to answer choice D.",
