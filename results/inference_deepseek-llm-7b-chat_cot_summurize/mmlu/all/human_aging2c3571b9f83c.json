They change a little\n\nTraits, such as physical characteristics, abilities, and behaviors, may vary to some extent over time, but not all of them do. Some traits may remain relatively consistent throughout an individual's life, while others may change or evolve as the person ages. For example, physical traits such as height and weight can change as a person grows and develops, but may not change significantly after the individual reaches their peak growth stage. In contrast, traits such as personality and habits can change over time as a person's experiences, environment, and relationships change.",
