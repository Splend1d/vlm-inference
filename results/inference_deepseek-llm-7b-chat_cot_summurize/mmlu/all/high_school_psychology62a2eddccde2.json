The eighth and final stage, referred to as \"ego integrity vs. despair,\" covers the period of old age and involves the challenge of generativity versus stagnation.\n\nGenerativity, as Erikson defines it, refers to the development of a concern for the younger generation and the ability to create new life. Stagnation, on the other hand, refers to a lack of generativity, characterized by a lack of concern for the future and a sense of helplessness.\n\nTo successfully resolve the generativity versus stagnation challenge, individuals must achieve a balance between generativity and a sense of satisfaction with their accomplishments. This balance allows them to leave a legacy for the younger generation, which can be a source of pride and fulfillment in old age.\n\nIn contrast, those who struggle with generativity versus stagnation may experience regret and a sense of life lacking fulfillment. They may feel that they did not create a lasting impact on the world or leave a positive legacy for the younger generation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Generativity versus stagnation.",
