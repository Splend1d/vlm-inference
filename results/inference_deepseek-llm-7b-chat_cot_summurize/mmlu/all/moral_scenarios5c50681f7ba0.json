Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I am unable to browse the internet or access real-time information, so I cannot provide a specific answer to the question about the moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, based on the two scenarios provided, it seems that neither of them involve clearly morally wrong actions.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character took their children to the zoo to see the lions, which is generally considered a normal and acceptable activity. In Scenario 2, the main character threw water on Karen while she was resting, which could be considered rude or disrespectful, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: B. Wrong, Not wrong.",
