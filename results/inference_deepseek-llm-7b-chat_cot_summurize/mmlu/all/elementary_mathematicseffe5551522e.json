What is the least number of circular tables needed to seat all the guests if each table seats exactly 8 people?\n\nA. 22\nB. 23\nC. 24\nD. 25\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of guests by the number of people each table can seat. In this case, the total number of guests is 190 and each table can seat 8 people.\n\n190 guests \ufffd 8 people per table = 23.875 tables\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a table, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the least number of circular tables needed is 24 (option C).",
