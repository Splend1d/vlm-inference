Problems with the car's brakes allegedly caused several accidents and injuries.

One class action was filed in federal court and the other was filed in state court.

Federal law, because the judgment was the result of a nationwide action governed by the federal class action rule.\nC. State law, because the judgment is being asserted in a state court.\nD. State law, because there is no general federal common law and preclusion is a common law doctrine.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. State law, because the judgment is being asserted in a state court.\n\nWhile the federal court judgment in the other class action may have some influence on the state court's decision, the state court is the proper venue to decide the effect of the judgment. According to the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1980), a judgment in one court may be applied by another court in a different case if the court finds that:\n\n(a) The judgment was rendered in a court with proper jurisdiction;\n(b) The judgment was rendered on the merits;\n(c) The judgment was rendered in a proceeding between the same parties or between parties under whom the same right, claim, or interest has or may be judicially determined.\n\nThe second element of the above rule, that the judgment was rendered on the merits, is often determined based on the substantive law of the forum. Therefore, the state court should look to state law to determine the effect of the federal court judgment.",
