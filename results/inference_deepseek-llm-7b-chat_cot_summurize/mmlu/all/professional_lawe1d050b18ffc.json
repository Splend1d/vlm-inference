In all likelihood, Congress's power to enact this legislation will derive from\n\nA. its power to tax and provide for the general welfare.\nB. its power to raise and support an army and declare war.\nC. its power to regulate commerce.\nD. its power to make laws regarding territory and other property belonging to the United States.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. its power to regulate commerce.\n\nThe Interstate Commerce Clause, also known as the Commerce Clause, is the power of the federal government to regulate commerce between the states. This clause is found in Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, which grants the federal government the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\" This power has been used by Congress to enact laws and regulations related to various industries, including airlines. Therefore, it is likely that Congress's power to enact the statute in question would derive from its power to regulate commerce.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. its power to tax and provide for the general welfare: While the federal government has the power to tax and provide for the general welfare, this power does not specifically grant it the authority to regulate the airline industry.\n\nB. its power to raise and support an army and declare war: This power is found in Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, and grants the federal government the authority to raise and support an army, as well as to declare war. However, it does not grant the authority to regulate the airline industry.\n\nD. its power to make laws regarding territory and other property belonging to the United States: This power is found in Article IV, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and grants the federal government the authority to regulate the territory and other property belonging to the United States. However, it does not specifically grant the authority to regulate the airline industry.",
