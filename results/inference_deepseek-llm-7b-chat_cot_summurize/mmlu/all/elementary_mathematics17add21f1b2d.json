Which number would Lucy not count?\n\nA. 11\nB. 22\nC. 34\nD. 48\n\nassistant:To determine which number Lucy would not count, we need to look at the numbers in the sequence. \n\nLucy starts with 2 and counts by 2s. So the numbers in the sequence would be: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48.\n\nFrom this list, we can see that the number 34 is not included in the sequence. Therefore, Lucy would not count the number 34.\nThe answer is C.",
