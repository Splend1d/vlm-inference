This is the total cost expended by the builder ($10,000) plus the builder's expected profit ($5,000), minus the loss avoided by the resale of the unused materials ($1,000). The builder's expected profit would be the contract price ($20,000) minus the costs expended ($10,000 + $5,000) for a total of $5,000. Therefore, the builder would be able to recover $14,000 by adding the costs expended ($10,000) and the expected profit ($5,000) together, and then subtracting the loss avoided by the resale of the unused materials ($1,000).",
