The temperature difference between the two ends of the rod varies from 10\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C. What geometric factors will influence the rate heat is transferred along the rod?\n\nA. Only the length\nB. Only the area of the rod\nC. Both the length and area\nD. Neither the length nor area\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Both the length and area.\n\nThe rate of heat transfer along a cylindrical rod depends on both the length and the surface area of the rod. The length of the rod affects the amount of heat that can be transferred, while the surface area of the rod affects the rate at which heat is transferred through the material. The radius of the rod, which is given in the question, also affects the heat transfer rate, but it is not specified in the options. Therefore, the correct answer is C, both the length and area.",
