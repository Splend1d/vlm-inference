She was competent to testify because she had personal knowledge of the matter and was able to provide information about what happened that day.\n\nOption A is incorrect because being a beneficiary of the policy does not disqualify a person from being a competent witness.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the neighbor being present in court does not necessarily mean the wife is incompetent as a witness. The neighbor can testify to what he observed, but the wife's testimony is equally important as she is the one who discovered her husband's body and can testify to the cause of death.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the wife's personal interest in the outcome of the lawsuit does not disqualify her from being a competent witness.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the fact that the wife was testifying to facts occurring after her husband's death does not make her incompetent as a witness. The relevant facts that the insurance company is disputing are the cause of her husband's death, not the time of his death.",
