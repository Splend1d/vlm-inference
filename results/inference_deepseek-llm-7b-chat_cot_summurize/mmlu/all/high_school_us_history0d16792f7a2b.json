Poor people don't deserve help.\n\nassistant:The passage describes how a group of working girls, facing difficulties during a strike in a large shoe factory, came together to form a boarding club to support each other. This initiative was led by Jane Addams, who provided the initial help by renting and furnishing the apartments. However, the members of the club managed it themselves after the first month. This demonstrates that Jane Addams believed in the potential of poor people to help themselves, and that they needed support in doing so. Therefore, the perspective of Jane Addams in the passage is best reflected by option B: Poor people need support in helping themselves.",
