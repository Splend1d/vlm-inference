How much energy is required to ionize helium (i.e., to remove one electron)?\n\nA. 24.6 eV\nB. 39.5 eV\nC. 51.8 eV\nD. 54.4 eV\n\nassistant:The energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV, not the energy required to remove one electron. The energy required to remove one electron from the helium atom in its ground state is 14.1 eV. Therefore, the answer is A. 24.6 eV.",
