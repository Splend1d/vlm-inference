If one integer is 45, what is the smallest possible value of the other integer?\n\nA. 165\nB. 46\nC. 45\nD. 9\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers, while the GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers evenly.\n\nGiven that the LCM of two numbers is divided by their GCD, and the result is 33, we can express this relationship as:\n\nLCM(a, b) / GCD(a, b) = 33\n\nwhere a and b are the two positive integers.\n\nWe are also given that one of the numbers is 45. Let's denote this number as a. So we have:\n\nLCM(a, b) / GCD(a, b) = 33\nLCM(a, b) / GCD(a, 45) = 33\n\nNow we need to find the smallest possible value of b, such that the LCM(a, b) is divisible by 33. We can start by finding the smallest prime factor of 33, which is 11. Since a is already a prime number (45 = 3 * 5 * 3), we need to find the smallest multiple of 11 that is divisible by a.\n\nLet's start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 2 is not divisible by 45, we move to the next prime number, which is 3. We can see that 3 is not divisible by 45 either. Continuing this process, we find that 11 is the first prime number that is divisible by 45. Therefore, the smallest possible value of b is 11.\n\nNow we can calculate the LCM(a, b) using the formula:\n\nLCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b) = (45 * 11) / 11 = 45\n\nThe smallest possible value of the other integer is 11, which corresponds to option A.",
