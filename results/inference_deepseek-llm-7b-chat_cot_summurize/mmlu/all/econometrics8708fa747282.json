(i), (ii), and (iii).\n\nThe use of panel data over pure cross-sectional or pure time-series modelling has several advantages. Panel data allows for the estimation of dynamic relationships over time and the use of fixed effects to control for unobserved time-invariant characteristics. Panel data also allows for the estimation of cross-sectional relationships, which is useful when comparing individuals across different points in time. Additionally, panel data can increase the number of degrees of freedom and therefore the power of tests, as it allows for the estimation of both time-series and cross-sectional effects.",
