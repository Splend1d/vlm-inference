However, it does not specifically protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered, which was the destruction of his entire home by fire. Therefore, the businesswoman cannot be held responsible for this type of harm, and the owner would not be able to recover anything from her.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the fair market value of the owner's house before the fire is not relevant to the claim against the businesswoman.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the claim against the businesswoman is not based on whether or not she caused the fire. The owner's claim is based on the fact that the accident caused the fire engine to be delayed in reaching his home, which resulted in the complete destruction of his home.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the businesswoman was driving in a way that violated the traffic statute, which means that she was responsible for the accident. Therefore, it is possible that the owner could recover something from her, even if the traffic statute does not specifically protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.",
