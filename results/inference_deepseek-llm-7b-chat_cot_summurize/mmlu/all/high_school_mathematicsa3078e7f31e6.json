If $(a,b)$ is the center of $C$ and $r$ is its radius, what is the value of $a+b+r$?\n\nA. -9\nB. -5\nC. -6\nD. -57\n\nassistant:We can rewrite the equation of the circle as $x^2+10x+y^2+12y=-57$. Completing the square, we get $(x+5)^2-25+(y+6)^2-36=-57$, or $(x+5)^2+(y+6)^2=4$. This is the equation of a circle with center $(-5,-6)$ and radius 4. Therefore, $a=-5$, $b=-6$, and $r=4$. The value of $a+b+r$ is $-5+(-6)+4=\\boxed{-57}$.\nThe answer is: -57",
