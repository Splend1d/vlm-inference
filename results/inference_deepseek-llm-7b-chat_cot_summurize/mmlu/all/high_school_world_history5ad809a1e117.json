They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n\nassistant:The tone of the first passage best supports the supposition that the British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority. In the first passage, William Bentinck expresses horror at the thought of consenting to the continued practice of sati, in which widows were burned alive on their husband's funeral pyre. However, he also acknowledges the potential danger of upsetting the balance of power in India by taking a contrary course. Bentinck ultimately advocates for an open and general prohibition of sati.\n\nThe second passage, by George Simpson, highlights the need for the Indians to feel their dependence on British-supplied foodstuffs and manufactured goods in order to maintain proper subordination. This suggests that the British were primarily motivated by maintaining their own authority and control over India, rather than by a concern for women's equality or the Christianization of the Hindu population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.",
