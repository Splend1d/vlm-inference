A man washes his car while it is parked on the street in front of his home. The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?\n\nA. The man was not aware of the ordinance.\nB. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.\nC. The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.\nD. The driver is not a resident of the city.\n\nassistant:Option A: The man was not aware of the ordinance.\n\nIf the man was not aware of the ordinance, this could potentially mitigate his negligence. It is possible that he did not know that washing his car on the street was against the law, and therefore, he did not have the opportunity to exercise due care. This fact could help the man argue that he did not act negligently, and therefore, he should not be held liable for the accident.",
