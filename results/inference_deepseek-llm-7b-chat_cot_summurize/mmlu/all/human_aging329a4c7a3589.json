This is because Apo-E 2 has been linked to longevity in some studies. While there is still much research to be done on the subject, it appears that the Apo-E 2 protein may play a role in protecting against age-related diseases and maintaining overall health. However, it is important to note that there is no guarantee that having the Apo-E 2 protein will result in a long life, as many other factors come into play when it comes to aging and health.",
