A slash-and-burn agricultural society\n\nassistant:B. A society with a highly mechanized agricultural sector is MOST likely to experience population pressure. This is because mechanized agriculture can produce more food per unit of land, allowing for a higher population density. Additionally, mechanized agriculture can also lead to increased exports, which can attract more people to the area. This increased population pressure can then lead to further mechanization of the agricultural sector, creating a positive feedback loop.",
