Mutation\nB. Non-random mating\nC. Genetic drift\nD. Natural selection\n\nassistant:To find the answer, let's examine each option and determine which one requires a small population as a precondition for its occurrence.\n\nA. Mutation: Mutations can occur in any population size, and their frequency is determined by the number of replication events and the population size. Therefore, mutation does not consistently require a small population as a precondition.\n\nB. Non-random mating: Non-random mating can lead to the fixation of advantageous alleles in small populations, as individuals have a higher chance of reproducing with other individuals who carry the same advantageous alleles. However, in large populations, non-random mating is less likely to result in the fixation of advantageous alleles, as there are more potential mates available. So, non-random mating does consistently require a small population as a precondition.\n\nC. Genetic drift: Genetic drift can cause changes in gene frequencies in small populations, but its effect is random and does not require a small population.\n\nD. Natural selection: Natural selection can change gene frequencies in any population size, as it depends on the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with different traits.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is B. Non-random mating, as it consistently requires a small population as a precondition for its occurrence.",
