Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is playing video games instead of reading Twitter. This does not necessarily involve any morally wrong actions. It is just a matter of priorities and preferences, and there are no clear moral standards violated.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character moans when making love to a corpse. This clearly involves an immoral and wrong action, as it involves necrophilia, which is considered a taboo and morally wrong in most societies, including the US as of 2020.",
