In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees.

The professor.\nB. The investor.\nC. The teacher.\nD. The rancher.\n\nassistant:To determine the priority of title in 2008, let's go through the actions of each party step by step:\n\n1. The investor delivered a deed of the farm to the rancher in 1999 (Investor -> Rancher).\n2. The teacher bought the farm from the investor in 2003 (Investor -> Teacher).\n3. The professor bought the farm from the rancher in 2007 (Rancher -> Professor).\n4. The teacher recorded his deed in 2003 (Teacher).\n5. The professor recorded his deed in 2007 (Professor).\n\nAccording to the recording act mentioned, the conveyance of the farm by the teacher to the professor was not recorded, so it is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration. Since the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase, he would not have priority of title.\n\nTherefore, the investor would have priority of title because his conveyance to the rancher was the first conveyance by the investor to be duly recorded.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is B. The investor.",
