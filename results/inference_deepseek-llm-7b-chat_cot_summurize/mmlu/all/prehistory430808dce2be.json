Neandertals had wide, squat torsos and short extremities.\nB. Neandertals had smaller brains and larger noses.\nC. Neandertal skeletons have more bones that modern Homo sapiens.\nD. Both a and b.\n\nassistant:Neandertals were physically different from modern Homo sapiens in several ways. They had some characteristics that are similar to modern humans, but also some that set them apart.\n\nA. Neandertals did have wider, squat torsos and shorter extremities compared to modern humans. Their bodies were more robust and stocky, with larger bones and a thicker build. This may have been due to their adaptation to colder climates and their need to maintain body heat.\n\nB. Neandertals did have smaller brains than modern humans, although the difference was not as significant as previously thought. Their brains were proportionally smaller, which may have affected their cognitive abilities. However, they were still capable of complex behaviors and cultural practices, as evidenced by their art and toolmaking abilities.\n\nC. Neandertal skeletons do have more bones than modern humans, which may have been due to their larger size and strength. They also had a different number of ribs and vertebrae, which may have affected their posture and mobility.\n\nSo, both A and B are correct, as Neandertals had both wider, squat torsos and smaller brains than modern humans.",
