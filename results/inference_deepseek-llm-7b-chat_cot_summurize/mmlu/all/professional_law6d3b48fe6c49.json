The agreement between the two companies is\n\nA. Unenforceable because it is too indefinite as to quantity.\nB. Unenforceable because it lacks mutuality of obligation.\nC. Unenforceable because of lack of consideration.\nD. Valid and enforceable.\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Unenforceable because it lacks mutuality of obligation.\n\nThe agreement between Base Electric Co. and Seymour Metal Wire Company is unenforceable because it lacks mutuality of obligation. A contract is enforceable if both parties have agreed to perform specific obligations. In this case, Base Electric Co. has agreed to buy copper wiring from Seymour Metal Wire Company, but there is no mention of Seymour Metal Wire Company's obligation to sell copper wiring to Base Electric Co.\n\nTherefore, the agreement is unenforceable because it lacks mutuality of obligation. The other options A, C, and D are incorrect because the agreement is not too indefinite as to quantity, it does involve consideration (i.e. Base Electric Co. will pay for the copper wiring), and it is not invalid because of lack of consideration.",
