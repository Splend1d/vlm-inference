Sincere, resigned\n\nassistant:Charles Dickens and William Wordsworth both wrote about the French Revolution, but their views on the revolution differ significantly. Dickens's description of the revolution in \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is filled with optimism and enthusiasm, while Wordsworth's view in \"The Prelude\" is more cynical and resigned.\n\nDickens's description of the revolution in \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is filled with optimism and enthusiasm. He talks about the \"best of times\" and the \"spring of hope,\" and describes the revolution as a time of enlightenment and progress. Dickens sees the revolution as a positive force that brings about change and progress, and he encourages his readers to embrace it.\n\nOn the other hand, Wordsworth's view of the revolution in \"The Prelude\" is more cynical and resigned. He describes the revolution as a time of darkness and despair, and sees it as a time of confusion and chaos. Wordsworth sees the revolution as a negative force that brings about destruction and suffering, and he seems to accept this as inevitable.\n\nBased on these differences, we can describe Dickens's view as optimistic and enthusiastic, while Wordsworth's view can be described as cynical and resigned. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Cynical, enthusiastic for Dickens's view and D. Sincere, resigned for Wordsworth's view.",
