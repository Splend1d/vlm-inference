If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\n\nA. 2c\nB. c\nC. 0.8c\nD. 0.5c\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect is a phenomenon where the frequency of a wave or\u5149\u6e90 is related to the relative motion between the source and the observer. In this case, the quasar's light is observed in the rest frame of Earth, so the Doppler effect must be taken into account.\n\nAccording to the Doppler effect, the frequency of a wave or light source is increased if the source is approaching the observer, and decreased if the source is receding from the observer. In this case, the quasar's light is approaching Earth, so the frequency of the light should be increased.\n\nHowever, we are given that the wavelengths of the hydrogen lines are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. This means that the light is shifted into the red, which indicates a decrease in frequency.\n\nThe only way to explain this apparent contradiction is if the shift is due to a combination of both the Doppler effect and a gravitational redshift. Gravitational redshift occurs when an object is in a gravitational field, and the frequency of light emitted by the object is decreased. In this case, the gravitational redshift would cause the wavelengths of the hydrogen lines to be shorter than those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth, but not as short as they would be if the shift was entirely due to the Doppler effect.\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar is not 2c, c, 0.8c, or 0.5c, but a combination of these speeds. We can represent this as a mixture of the speeds using a weighted average, where the weights are the probabilities of each speed. Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact probabilities, we can only say that the relative speed of the quasar is a weighted average of the given speeds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",
