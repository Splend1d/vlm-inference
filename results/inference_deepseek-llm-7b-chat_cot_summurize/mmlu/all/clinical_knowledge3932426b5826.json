To create an air seal within the trachea and reduce the risk of aspirating saliva or gastric contents.\nB. To reduce local oedema.\nC. To assist with swallowing.\nD. To allow the patient to talk.\n\nassistant:The purpose of the cuff on a tracheostomy tube is to create an air seal within the trachea and reduce the risk of aspirating saliva or gastric contents. The cuff is inflated with air to create a seal around the tracheostomy tube, preventing air from entering or exiting the trachea. This helps to maintain a stable airway and prevents the patient from aspirating fluids into their lungs. The cuff also allows for easy insertion and removal of the tracheostomy tube.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. To create an air seal within the trachea and reduce the risk of aspirating saliva or gastric contents.",
