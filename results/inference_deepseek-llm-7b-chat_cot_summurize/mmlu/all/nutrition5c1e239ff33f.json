C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids include arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, which are precursors for eicosanoids such as prostaglandins and thromboxanes, respectively. C18 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (B) are also precursors for eicosanoids, but they do not contain all the necessary double bonds for eicosanoid biosynthesis. C20 and C22 monounsaturated fatty acids (C) do not have the required double bonds, and C20 and C22 saturated fatty acids (A) do not have the double bonds required for eicosanoid biosynthesis.",
