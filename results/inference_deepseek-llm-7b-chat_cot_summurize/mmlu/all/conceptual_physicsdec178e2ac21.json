If you instead throw it downward assuming no air resistance its acceleration immediately after leaving your hand is\n\nA. 9.8 m/s2\nB. more than 9.8 m/s2\nC. less than 9.8 m/s2\nD. Cannot say unless the speed of throw is given.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. more than 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nWhen you throw a ball downward, it starts with an initial velocity (V\u2080) given by the formula:\n\nV\u2080 = a\u2080 \\* t\n\nwhere a\u2080 is the acceleration of the throw (in this case, 9.8 m/s\u00b2) and t is the time it takes for the ball to leave your hand (measured in seconds).\n\nTo find the initial velocity, we need to know the time it takes for the ball to leave your hand. This information is not provided in the question, so we cannot determine the exact value of V\u2080. However, we do know that V\u2080 is greater than 0 (since the ball is being thrown downward), which means that the acceleration of the throw (9.8 m/s\u00b2) is greater than the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s\u00b2). Therefore, the ball will have an initial velocity greater than 9.8 m/s\u00b2, and its acceleration immediately after leaving your hand will also be greater than 9.8 m/s\u00b2.",
