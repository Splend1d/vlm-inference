Then, we can multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to get $10x=7.\\overline{7}$. Subtracting the original equation from this new equation, we get $10x-x=7.\\overline{7}-0.\\overline{7}$, which simplifies to $9x=7$. Dividing both sides by 9, we find that $x=\\frac{7}{9}$. Therefore, the answer is B. \\frac{7}{9}.",
