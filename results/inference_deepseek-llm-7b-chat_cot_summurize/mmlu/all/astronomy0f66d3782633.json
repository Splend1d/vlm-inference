It had an angular size of about 0.5 degrees (~30 pixels). How far away was this rock from the rover?\n\nA. About 6 meters\nB. About 6 feet\nC. About 10 meters\nD. About 10 feet\n\nassistant:To determine the distance between the rover and the rock, we can use the angular size of the rock and the angular size of the full moon (which is about 30'. The angular size of the full moon is about 0.5 degrees (~30 pixels) as well, so we can use this as a reference point.\n\nThe angular size of the full moon is about 0.5 degrees, which is about 30 pixels. The angular size of the rock is about 0.5 degrees (~30 pixels), so we can use this as a reference point.\n\nWe can use the following formula to calculate the distance between the rover and the rock:\n\nDistance = Angular size of the full moon \\* 10,000\n\nDistance = 0.5 degrees \\* 10,000\n\nDistance = 5,000 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the rover and the rock is about 5,000 meters, which is option C.",
