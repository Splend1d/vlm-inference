The follicular phase is to the menstrual phase as the luteal phase is to the secretory phase.\n\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the menstrual cycle, lasting about 10-14 days. During this time, the egg is released from the ovary and the uterine lining begins to thicken in preparation for a possible pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is shed and the menstrual period begins.\n\nThe luteal phase, on the other hand, is the second part of the menstrual cycle, lasting about 14 days. During this time, the ruptured follicle forms a corpus luteum, which produces progesterone and estrogen. These hormones help to maintain the thickened uterine lining in preparation for a possible pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates and the lining is shed, leading to another menstrual period.\n\nTherefore, the follicular phase is to the menstrual phase as the luteal phase is to the secretory phase.",
