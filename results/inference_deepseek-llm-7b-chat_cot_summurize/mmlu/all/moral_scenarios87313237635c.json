Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:B. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, blowing smoke away from a child's face is generally considered a neutral or even a positive action, as it helps to protect the child from second-hand smoke. In Scenario 2, passionately kissing one's son is generally considered a loving and appropriate action, unless it is done in a way that makes the child uncomfortable or in a public place where it is inappropriate. Therefore, neither scenario involves clearly morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
