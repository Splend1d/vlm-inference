Vietnam\nB. United Kingdom\nC. Germany\nD. Bolivia\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first need to understand the concept of a relict boundary.\n\nStep 1: Identify the concept\n- A relict boundary is a geological boundary that has survived to the present day as a visible feature, such as a coastline, a mountain range, or a river system.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options\n- A. Vietnam: The Red River (in northern Vietnam) is a relict boundary that separates the Hercynian fold-and-thrust belt from the Red River plain.\n- B. United Kingdom: The Scottish Highlands, the Lake District, and the Pennines are all relict boundaries that have survived from the Variscan orogenic events.\n- C. Germany: The Harz Mountains and the Weser Uplands are both relict boundaries that have survived from the Variscan orogenic events.\n- D. Bolivia: The Andes are a relict boundary that has survived from the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer\n- None of the options provided are the only relict boundary from a specific geological event. Instead, they all have multiple relict boundaries that have survived to the present day.\n\nConclusion: Based on the information given, it is not possible to determine which country does NOT have a well-known example of a relict boundary.",
