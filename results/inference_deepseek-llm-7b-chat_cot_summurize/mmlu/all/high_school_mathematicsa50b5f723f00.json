The region bounded by the parabola y = x^2, the lines y = 1, and y = 9 forms a right triangle with height 9 - 1 = 8 and base x.\n\nWe can set up the integral as follows:\n\nArea = \u222b(1/3)x^2 dx from 0 to 9\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nArea = (1/3)x^3 | from 0 to 9\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nArea = (1/3)(9^3) - (1/3)(0^3)\n\nArea = (1/3)(729)\n\nArea = 243\n\nTherefore, the area bounded by the parabola y = x^2 and the lines y = 1 and y = 9 is 8.",
