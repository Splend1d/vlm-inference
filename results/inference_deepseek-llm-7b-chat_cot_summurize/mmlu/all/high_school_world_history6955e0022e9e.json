Religious tolerance. The Mongol Empire had a strong impact on international trade and communication, which can be seen in the spread of ideas and new inventions such as the game of chess and the development of public libraries. Additionally, the law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction and facilitated the spread of religious tolerance. The Mongols were tolerant of various religions and allowed them to coexist within their vast realm, which allowed for a more open exchange of ideas and cultures.",
