What is the ratio of the two concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN]?\n\nA. 1:1\nB. 1:3\nC. 1:6\nD. 2:3\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. 1:1.\n\nIn a 1H NMR spectrum, the lines with relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1 correspond to the carbon atoms with chemical shifts of \u03b4 and 3\u03b4, respectively. This implies that the two carbon atoms must be bonded to the same methyl group. The only possible configuration for a carbon atom bonded to two methyl groups is a quaternary carbon center. Therefore, the mixture must contain a quaternary alcohol (DMSO) and an alkyl halide (AN), such as dimethylammonium chloride (DMAc). The two molecules are in a 1:1 ratio.",
