The plaintiff will win because even though the company is a privately owned corporation, the state has affirmatively encouraged or facilitated its discriminating acts.\n\nThe correct answer is B. The state has granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages, and has approved the company's bylaws. This suggests that the state has encouraged or facilitated the company's discriminatory practices. The other answers are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the relationship between the state and the company, or the plaintiff's standing to bring the action.",
