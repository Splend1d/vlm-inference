Suppose they decided to increase the sample size from 200 to 2,000. How will this affect the distribution of the sample proportion?\n\nA. The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.\nB. The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\nC. The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected.\nD. The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.\n\nWhen a sample size increases, the Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample proportion tends to become more normal, or binomial, regardless of the shape of the population proportion. This is because the standard deviation of the sample proportion is approximately equal to the population proportion divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nIn this case, increasing the sample size from 200 to 2,000 will result in a larger population proportion, which means the standard deviation of the sample proportion will decrease. This will cause the distribution of the sample proportion to become more symmetric and closer to a normal or binomial distribution.",
