Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n\nIn this case, the chef is suing the nephew for the value of the oil removed from the 100-acre tract and for an injunction against further oil removal. The nephew acquired the property from the investor in 1990, and the wife's death without issue would have no impact on the nephew's estate or the right to remove oil. The nature of the nephew's estate would not be altered by the wife's death, and the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession. Therefore, the answer is D, which is the only answer that addresses the nephew's fee and the certainty of its termination.",
