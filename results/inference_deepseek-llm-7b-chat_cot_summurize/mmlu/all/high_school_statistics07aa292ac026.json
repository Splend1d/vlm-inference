Sixty percent of its customers request an oil change, 30 percent request tire replacements, and 10 percent request both. A customer requests an oil change. What is the probability this customer does not request tire replacements?\n\nA. 0.42\nB. 0.5\nC. 0.7\nD. 0.833\n\nassistant:Let's denote the probability of a customer not requesting a tire replacement as P(not requesting tire replacement). We know that 30% of customers request tire replacements, so the probability of a customer requesting a tire replacement is 30%. The probability of a customer requesting both an oil change and tire replacement is 10%. \n\nNow, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the probability of a customer not requesting a tire replacement:\n\nP(not requesting tire replacement) = P(not requesting tire replacement) + P(not requesting tire replacement and not requesting oil change) + P(not requesting tire replacement and requesting oil change)\n\nWe know that P(not requesting tire replacement and not requesting oil change) = 0.3 (since 10% of customers request both services)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nP(not requesting tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.2\n\nNow we can convert this probability to a percentage:\n\nP(not requesting tire replacement) = 0.2 * 100 = 20%\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 0.5.",
