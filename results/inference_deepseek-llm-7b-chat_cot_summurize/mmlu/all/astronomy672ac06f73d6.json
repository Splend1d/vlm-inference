As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.\n\nThe solar nebula, also known as the protoplanetary disk, is the theoretical region in space where the Sun and the planets formed. According to the nebular hypothesis, the Sun and the planets formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust, which eventually collapsed under its own gravity. As the cloud collapsed, it experienced a decrease in its gravitational potential energy, which was converted to kinetic energy. This increase in kinetic energy caused the gas and dust particles within the nebula to move faster, creating friction and heat. Eventually, some of this heat was converted into thermal energy, causing the nebula to heat up.",
