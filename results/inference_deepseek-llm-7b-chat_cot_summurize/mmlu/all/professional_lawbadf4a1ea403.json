A price increase is sufficient for discharge.\nC. The failure to excuse performance would result in grave injustice.\nD. The impracticality must go to a basic assumption on which the contract was made.\n\nassistant:Correct answer: A. The problem must not have been caused by the fault of the party seeking to invoke the defense.\n\nExplanation: Discharge for impracticability is a legal doctrine that allows a party to a contract to be released from its contractual obligations if an unforeseen event renders performance of the contract impracticable. However, the party seeking to invoke the defense must not have caused the event that rendered performance impracticable. If the party caused the event, then the defense of impracticability would not be available.\n\nB. A price increase is not a requirement for discharge. The party seeking discharge must show that performance is impracticable, not that there has been a price increase.\nC. The failure to excuse performance does not necessarily result in grave injustice. The test for discharge for impracticability is whether performance would be unjust, not whether it would result in grave injustice.\nD. The impracticality must go to a basic assumption on which the contract was made. This is not necessarily true. The impracticality must render performance impracticable, not necessarily go to a basic assumption on which the contract was made.",
