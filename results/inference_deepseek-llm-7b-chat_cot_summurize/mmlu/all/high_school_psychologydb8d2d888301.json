They are often associated with the hypnagogic state, which is the period of time just before falling asleep when a person may experience vivid visual or auditory hallucinations. Alpha waves can also be present during periods of relaxation, meditation, or light meditation. Stage 2 sleep, Stage 3 sleep, and Stage 4 sleep are all stages of non-REM sleep, and alpha waves are not typically associated with these stages.",
