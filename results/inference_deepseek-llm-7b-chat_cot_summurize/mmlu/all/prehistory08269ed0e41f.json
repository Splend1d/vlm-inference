Option A is related to art and fire, which were important aspects of human culture but not the main factor in their survival. Option B is about interbreeding with other hominids, which is not a significant factor in their survival and success. Option C is about hunting large mammals, which is an important aspect of human survival but not the key factor. In contrast, option D refers to the ability to adapt, which allowed anatomically modern human beings to survive and thrive in various environments and situations.",
