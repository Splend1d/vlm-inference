Social Security benefits\nD. bills of attainder\n\nassistant:The government promotes preferential treatment for members of groups that have historically suffered from discrimination by means of affirmative action programs.\n\nAffirmative action programs are designed to address and rectify the effects of past discrimination and to promote diversity and equal opportunity in education, employment, and other areas. These programs aim to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in various sectors, such as education, employment, and public services.\n\nWhile the New Federalism is a constitutional principle that shifted power and responsibilities from the federal government to the states, it does not directly address preferential treatment for historically discriminated groups. Social Security benefits are a social welfare program that provides financial assistance to individuals who are unable to work due to age, disability, or other reasons, but they do not promote preferential treatment for historically discriminated groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. affirmative action programs.",
