Now, if more people have money (a stronger stock market), they might buy more cookies (spend more money) to enjoy them. This is like a change in the consumption function. \n\nNow, think of the people who sell cookies. They're like businesses, and they'll also have more money to spend on things they need. This is like a change in aggregate demand.\n\nSo, if more people have money (a stronger stock market), it will cause both the consumption function and aggregate demand to increase.
