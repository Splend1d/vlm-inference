An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter.\nB.

Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense.\n\nassistant:I will analyze each statement to determine which one is positive.\n\nA. An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter.\nThis statement is positive because it implies that producing more butter is better than producing more guns, as butter is considered a positive good.\n\nB. Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war.\nThis statement is positive as well, as it suggests that producing wholesome consumer goods is preferable to producing weapons of war.\n\nC. The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs.\nThis statement is not positive or negative on its own, as it is a description of a concept in economics.\n\nD. Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense.\nThis statement is neutral, as it suggests that national defense is necessary, but does not specify if it is positive or negative to devote resources to it.\n\nComparing the two positive statements, \"An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter\" and \"Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war,\" the first statement is more positive in general, as it emphasizes the importance of consumer goods and economic well-being.",
