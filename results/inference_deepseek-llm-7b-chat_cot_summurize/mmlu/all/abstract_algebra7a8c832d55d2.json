Statement 2 | A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.\nThis statement is true. It is a well-known result in group theory that there exists an abelian group of rank (also known as dimension) equal to every positive integer. This result is often used in the study of topological groups and their properties.\n\nStatement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\nThis statement is false. A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if it is generated by a finite set of elements that is also free. The Betti numbers, which count the number of independent homology generators in a topological space, do not necessarily correspond to the number of elements in a generating set for an abelian group. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nThe correct answer is D. False, True.",
