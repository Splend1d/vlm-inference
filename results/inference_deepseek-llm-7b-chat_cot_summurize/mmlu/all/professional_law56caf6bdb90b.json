He was arrested in the car two days later. In his defense, the defendant has testified that he had no intention of keeping the car but got caught up in marital problems and simply delayed returning it. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant told him, during the two days, \"I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife.\" Is the witness's testimony admissible?\n\nA.

Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n\nassistant:The witness's testimony is admissible as a prior consistent statement of the defendant. In this case, the defendant's statement to the witness that he would return the car as soon as he worked things out with his wife is a prior consistent statement because it shows that the defendant did not intend to keep the car and was planning to return it. This statement is not hearsay and does not fall under any of the exceptions that would render it inadmissible. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Yes, as a prior consistent statement of the defendant.",
