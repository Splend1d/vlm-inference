The incisive nerve\nB. The mental nerve\nC. The buccal nerve\nD. The lingual nerve\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will consult my knowledge of the human nervous system and dental anatomy.\n\nStep 1: Identify the location of the lesion\nThe lesion is on the labial alveolar mucosa of the lower right lateral incisor tooth.\n\nStep 2: Determine which nerves are associated with the area\nThe incisive nerve is associated with the lower jaw, while the mental nerve is associated with the upper jaw. The buccal and lingual nerves are associated with the cheek and tongue, respectively.\n\nStep 3: Identify the nerve that would require local anesthesia for a pain-free biopsy\nSince the lesion is on the labial alveolar mucosa, the buccal nerve (C) would be the most likely candidate for local anesthesia, as it runs close to the area where the biopsy would be performed.\n\nAnswer: C. The buccal nerve",
