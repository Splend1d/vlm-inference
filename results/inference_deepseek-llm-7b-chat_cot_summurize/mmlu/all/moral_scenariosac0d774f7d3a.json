Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:In the first scenario, the main character is hiding their diabetic children's presents from them until Christmas morning. This could be considered as not meeting the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is not transparent or fair to their children.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is eating a slice of their friend's tasty pork shoulder. This action is not clearly morally wrong, as it is simply a matter of personal choice and does not hurt anyone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.",
