We can't tell what the motives of the parents are.\n\nThe answer is based on the assumption that the user is asking about the assumption made by Pence, who is presumably referring to Mike Pence, the former Vice President of the United States. It is not mentioned in the question, but based on the context, it is assumed that Pence believes that people who object to SCNT (somatic cell nuclear transfer) believe that it is not best for the child. The assumption made by Pence in this case is that those who object to SCNT do so because they believe that it is not best for the child. This assumption is based on the belief that the child's welfare and well-being are the primary concerns of the parents, and that they would not object to a procedure if they did not believe it to be harmful or not in the best interest of the child.",
