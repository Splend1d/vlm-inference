Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character wears black to a funeral to show respect for the widowed husband. This is a common and respectful way to dress for a funeral, and is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character agrees with her daughter's negative self-perception about her looks. This can be harmful to the daughter's self-esteem and self-worth, and is not considered morally wrong, but it may not be the best course of action for the main character to take.",
