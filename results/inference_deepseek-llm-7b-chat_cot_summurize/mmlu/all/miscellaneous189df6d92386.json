Planting bean seeds in paper cups, placing them on the windowsill, and watering them daily\n\nassistant:Option D, Planting bean seeds in paper cups, placing them on the windowsill, and watering them daily, will be most effective in introducing kindergartners to the concept of how plants transport water. This activity allows the children to observe the growth of the bean seeds and the role that water plays in their growth. It also allows them to see the process of the roots absorbing water from the soil.\n\nOption A, Demonstrating that a celery stalk can be peeled lengthwise but not crosswise, is not relevant to the concept of how plants transport water.\n\nOption B, Placing celery stalks in water colored with a dye and observing the results, is interesting but does not directly show the process of how plants transport water.\n\nOption C, Collecting rainwater in a rain gauge and comparing the amount of rainfall to a plant's growth rate, is not an effective way to introduce the concept of how plants transport water. It shows the importance of water to plants, but does not directly show the process of how the plants transport water.",
