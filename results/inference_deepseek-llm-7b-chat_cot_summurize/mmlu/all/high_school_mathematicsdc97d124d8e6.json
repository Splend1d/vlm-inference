She reads 250 words per minute. She counted the words on one quarter of a typical page and found that there were approximately 200 words per page. To the nearest minute, how long will it take Veronica to read the book?\n\nA. 225\nB. 320\nC. 400\nD. 450\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book, the number of pages Veronica needs to read to complete the book, and then multiply that by her reading speed.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of words in the book. We know that there are 400 pages and each page has approximately 200 words. So, the total number of words is:\n\n400 pages * 200 words/page = 80,000 words\n\nNext, we need to find the number of pages Veronica needs to read to complete the book. Since the book has 400 pages and Veronica has already read 1/4 of a typical page, we can calculate how many pages she has read so far:\n\n1/4 * 400 pages = 100 pages\n\nTo find the remaining pages, we subtract the number of pages she has read from the total number of pages:\n\n400 pages - 100 pages = 300 pages\n\nNow we can calculate the number of words Veronica needs to read to complete the book:\n\n300 pages * 200 words/page = 60,000 words\n\nFinally, we can find the time it will take Veronica to read the book by dividing the number of words she needs to read by her reading speed:\n\n60,000 words / 250 words/minute = 240 minutes\n\nTo the nearest minute, it will take Veronica 240 minutes to read the book.
