Calcium\nB. Potassium\nC. Zinc\nD. Iron\n\nassistant:A. Calcium\n\nHigh intakes of foods containing phytic acid do not affect the absorption of calcium. Calcium is relatively resistant to phytate inhibition, meaning that it can still be absorbed even when phytic acid is present. Phytate binds to calcium, but the strength of this bond is relatively weak compared to other minerals, such as iron and zinc, which are more susceptible to phytate inhibition. Additionally, phytic acid can interfere with the absorption of zinc and iron by competing for the same transport mechanisms in the small intestine. Therefore, while phytic acid can reduce the absorption of certain minerals, it does not have a significant impact on the absorption of calcium.",
