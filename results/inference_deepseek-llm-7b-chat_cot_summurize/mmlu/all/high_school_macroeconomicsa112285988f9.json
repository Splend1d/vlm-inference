However, if the decrease in inventories is significant enough, it may also lead to a decrease in demand for products, which may cause prices to fall. This is because a decrease in inventories can indicate that a company is having difficulty meeting demand, and may prompt consumers to look for alternative sources of supply. Therefore, the correct answer is A. prices to begin to fall.",
