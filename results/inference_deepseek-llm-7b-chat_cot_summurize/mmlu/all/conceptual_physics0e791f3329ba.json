Since gravity acts on the crate, we can use the following equation for the force required:\n\nForce = Mass \u00d7 Acceleration due to gravity\n\nForce = 100 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2\nForce = 980 N\n\nNext, we can find the velocity at which the crate is raised. Since the time taken to lift the crate is 4 seconds, we can use the following equation for the velocity:\n\nVelocity = Distance \u00d7 Time\n\nVelocity = 2 m \u00d7 (4 s)\nVelocity = 8 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the power required to lift the crate:\n\nPower = Force \u00d7 Velocity\nPower = 980 N \u00d7 8 m/s\nPower = 7840 W\n\nHowever, none of the provided answer choices match the calculated power of 7840 W. There might be an error in the answer choices.",
