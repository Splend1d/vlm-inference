Conspiracy and larceny.\n\nassistant:The friend is guilty of the offense of burglary in a common law jurisdiction. In this scenario, the friend helped the young man plan the theft by driving him to the neighbor's house and calling the police on his cell phone, but he did not physically participate in the crime. This makes him guilty of the lesser offense of burglary, which is the act of entering a building with the intent to commit a crime inside. The young man, on the other hand, is guilty of both burglary and larceny, as he not only committed the act of breaking and entering, but also stole the large-screen TV.",
