Remove any large outliers from the data.\n\nassistant:A plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality in a regression model would be to use a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one, or to estimate the model in first differenced form. Both of these approaches can help to address issues with non-normality by transforming the data or reducing its dimensionality, respectively.\n\nHowever, adding lags of the variables on the right hand side of the regression model is not necessarily a plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality. Adding lags can be a useful way to address issues with serial correlation or heteroscedasticity, but it is not necessarily the best approach when the problem is with residual non-normality. In fact, adding lags can sometimes make the problem worse if the data is already log-linear or log-additive in nature.\n\nFinally, removing any large outliers from the data is not necessarily a plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality. While removing outliers can be a useful way to address issues with heteroscedasticity or other types of violations of model assumptions, it is not necessarily the best approach when the problem is with residual non-normality. In fact, removing outliers can sometimes make the problem worse if the outliers are simply extreme values of a normally distributed variable.",
