The defendant's attorney's motion to prevent the introduction of the heroin into evidence is most likely to be granted under option A. This is because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The other options B, C, and D are not valid reasons to grant the motion because they do not involve a violation of the Fourth Amendment or the lack of probable cause.",
