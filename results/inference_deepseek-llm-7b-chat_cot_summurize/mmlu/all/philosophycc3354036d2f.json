This is because, according to Sartre's philosophy, human beings are essentially free and responsible for their own actions. Therefore, the absence of a divine being does not negate the existence of moral values, which are derived from the human experience and our recognition of our own freedom and responsibility.\n\nThe other options are not accurate:\n\nA. Anything is not necessarily permissible. While the absence of a divine being might lead to different moral beliefs and values, it does not mean that anything is permissible.\n\nB. Moral values do not necessarily come from nature. While nature provides the basis for human existence and development, moral values are derived from human experiences and our recognition of our own freedom and responsibility, not from nature alone.\n\nD. Man does not necessarily not exist. The absence of a divine being does not negate the existence of human beings.",
