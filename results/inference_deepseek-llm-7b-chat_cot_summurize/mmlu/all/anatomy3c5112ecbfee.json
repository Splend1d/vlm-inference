This fluid acts as a shock absorber, helps to protect the brain, and provides a moist environment for the brain to function properly. The dura mater is a thick, tough membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord, and CSF circulates between the skull and dura mater through small channels called the subarachnoid spaces.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the arachnoid mater is the second layer of the meninges that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, and it lies between the dura mater and pia mater.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the pia mater is the innermost layer of the meninges that covers the brain and spinal cord, and it lies directly against the brain and spinal cord.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the brain surface is the outermost layer of the meninges, and it does not come into contact with CSF.",
