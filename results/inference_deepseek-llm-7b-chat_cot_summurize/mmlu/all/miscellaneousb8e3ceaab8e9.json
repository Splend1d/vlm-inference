New entrants to the labor market\nB. People who are laid off and are looking for new jobs\nC. Discouraged people who have given up looking for jobs\nD. Full-time students looking for part-time jobs\n\nassistant:The official unemployment rate in the United States is calculated based on a survey of households, which includes people who are unemployed, have actively searched for work in the past four weeks, and are currently available for work. Therefore, the official unemployment rate does not include people who have entered the labor market for the first time, full-time students looking for part-time jobs, or people who are laid off and are looking for new jobs.\n\nOption A refers to \"new entrants to the labor market,\" which are not included in the official unemployment rate because they have not actively searched for work in the past four weeks.\n\nOption D refers to \"full-time students looking for part-time jobs,\" which are not included in the official unemployment rate because they are not actively searching for work and are not currently unemployed.\n\nOption B refers to \"people who are laid off and are looking for new jobs,\" which are included in the official unemployment rate because they are considered unemployed if they have lost their jobs in the past four weeks and have actively searched for work in the past four weeks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, B, and D.",
