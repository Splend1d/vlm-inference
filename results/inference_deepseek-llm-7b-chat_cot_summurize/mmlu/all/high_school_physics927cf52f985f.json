Two objects, A and B, have equal charge and equal mass.\n2. Neither body is in motion because the gravitational and electrostatic forces between them are equal.\n3. If the mass of Object A is halved, we need to find the condition for maintaining equilibrium.\n\nOption A: doubling the charge on Object A will not maintain the equilibrium because doubling the charge will change the electrostatic force between the objects, which is already equal.\n\nOption B: halving the charge on Object B will not maintain the equilibrium because halving the charge will change the electrostatic force between the objects, which is already equal.\n\nOption C: doubling the charge on Object B will not maintain the equilibrium because doubling the charge will change the electrostatic force between the objects, which is already equal.\n\nOption D: halving the mass on Object B will maintain the equilibrium because halving the mass will change the gravitational force between the objects, but since the electrostatic force is already equal, the new gravitational force will be equal to the original electrostatic force, maintaining the equilibrium.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option D: the mass on Object B should be halved to maintain equilibrium.",
