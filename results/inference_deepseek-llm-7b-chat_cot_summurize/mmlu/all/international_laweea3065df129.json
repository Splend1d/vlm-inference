Domestic law always prevails over international law\nB. Only customary international law prevails over domestic law\nC. Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law\nD. Constitutional obligations always prevail over obligations under international law\n\nassistant:C. Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law\n\nIn international law, countries have certain obligations and responsibilities that they must fulfill. These obligations are created to maintain a stable and peaceful global environment, and they are binding on all countries that are parties to the relevant treaties or conventions.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that domestic law can also impact the way in which countries fulfill their international obligations. For example, domestic laws may provide additional rights or protections that are not explicitly outlined in international law. In such cases, the domestic law may be given precedence over international law.\n\nIn general, however, when a conflict arises between domestic law and international law, international law should prevail. This is because international law is created to regulate relations between countries and promote global peace and security. Therefore, countries should prioritize their obligations under international law over domestic law when necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that this answer is based on the assumption that the question is referring to customary international law, which is a body of generally accepted principles that are considered to be part of international law. If the question is referring to treaty law, the answer may be different.",
