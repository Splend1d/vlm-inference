How many independent parameters would we need if we made no assumptions about independence or conditional independence H -> U <- P <- W?\n\nA. 3\nB. 4\nC. 7\nD. 15\n\nassistant:To determine the number of independent parameters, we need to consider the number of nodes and edges in the Bayesian network.\n\nWe can represent the Bayesian network as follows:\n```markdown\nH -> U <- P <- W\n```\nLet's count the number of nodes and edges:\n\nNodes:\n- H\n- U\n- P\n- W\n\nEdges:\n- H -> U\n- P <- W\n\nThere are 4 edges and 4 nodes in the Bayesian network. To determine the number of independent parameters, we need to consider the dependencies between the variables.\n\nIf we make no assumptions about independence or conditional independence, we can consider each variable as having an independent parameter. In this case, we have 4 variables, so the number of independent parameters would be 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 4.",
