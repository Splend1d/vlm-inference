Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\n\nUnder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the search of a person's vehicle requires a warrant, unless there are exceptional circumstances. In this case, the officer's search of the driver's vehicle did not fall under the exception of exceptional exigent circumstances. Therefore, the search must be suppressed.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. The search of the driver's vehicle was unreasonable because it was conducted without a warrant, which is required when searching someone's property.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the driver was secured in the squad car at the time of the search further supports the argument that the search should be suppressed. The driver had no expectation of privacy in the car while it was secured in the squad car, and the officer's search of the vehicle violated her Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the trial court is likely to grant the driver's motion to suppress the cocaine found in her vehicle, as the search was conducted without a warrant and violated her Fourth Amendment rights.",
