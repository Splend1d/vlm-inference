Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.\nB. Dopamine and acetyl choline.\nC. Glutamate and serotonin.\nD. Dopamine and serotonin.\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Dopamine and acetyl choline.\n\nPharmacological agents that target these neurotransmitters have been shown to influence fatigue development in certain cases. Dopamine is involved in motivation and attention, while acetylcholine is involved in muscle control and cognitive function. By modulating these neurotransmitters, pharmacological agents can impact fatigue levels and overall brain function.",
