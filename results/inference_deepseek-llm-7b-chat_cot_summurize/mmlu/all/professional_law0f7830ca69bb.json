Chickenshop's reply constitutes a conditional acceptance, but not a counteroffer.\n\nExplanation: In this case, Calvin Poultry Co. made an offer to sell Chickenshop 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound. Chickenshop accepted the offer by stating, \"We accept your offer for 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound per city scale weight certificate.\" This is a conditional acceptance, as it is subject to the condition that the chicken is delivered per city scale weight certificate. However, it is not a counteroffer, as Chickenshop did not make any changes to the terms of the original offer. Therefore, a contract was formed on Calvin's terms.",
