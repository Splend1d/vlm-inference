Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate.

The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD.
