Following the accident, the driver was admitted to the hospital where he was treated for his injuries. While at the hospital, the driver was diagnosed with a broken back.

This is the manufacturer's fault, as they failed to include a safety latch that could have prevented the stirrup from falling off when not securely fastened. Therefore, the driver has a strong case to assert a claim against the manufacturer.",
