The price level rises but real GDP falls.\nB. Both the price level and real GDP rise.\nC. The price level rises but the change in real GDP is uncertain.\nD. Real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Both the price level and real GDP rise.\n\nWhen both short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand increase, it means that both the supply of goods and services and the demand for those goods and services increase. This leads to a rise in the price level (also known as inflation) and an increase in real GDP.\n\nA. is incorrect because it states that the price level rises but real GDP falls. This would only be the case if the increase in aggregate supply was offset by an increase in aggregate demand, which is not the situation described.\n\nC. is also incorrect because it states that the price level rises but the change in real GDP is uncertain. This implies that there is some ambiguity or unpredictability in the increase in real GDP, which is not the case when both supply and demand are increasing.\n\nD. is incorrect because it states that real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.
