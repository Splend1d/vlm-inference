Open defecation is the practice of defecating in an open space, such as fields or streets, instead of using a toilet. This practice is common in many parts of the world, especially in rural areas and developing countries.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 24% of the global population still practices open defecation. This means that about 1.1 billion people still defecate in the open. The WHO also states that improving sanitation and increasing access to toilets can help prevent the spread of diseases and improve public health.\n\nSo, the closest answer to the percentage of the world population practicing open defecation as of 2020 is around 24%.",
