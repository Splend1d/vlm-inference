She notices, after a few generations, a new variant that has a distinct phenotype. When she tries to breed the original phenotype with the new one, no offspring are produced.

Polyploidy\n\nassistant:This example illustrates sympatric speciation. The original phenotype is unable to breed with the new variant due to reproductive isolation, which leads to the formation of a new species. The new variants are able to breed with each other and produce offspring with the new variant phenotype.",
