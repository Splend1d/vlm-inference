Technology companies can spend less effort developing new processors because processing speed will always improve at the observed rate.\n\nassistant:C. Technology companies can set research and development goals based on anticipated processing speeds.\n\nExplanation:\nThe observation that computer processing speeds tend to double every two years can be useful for technology companies in several ways. One of these ways is setting research and development goals based on anticipated processing speeds. This would allow companies to focus their efforts on creating new technologies that can take advantage of the increased processing speeds, and to plan their product development cycles accordingly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while companies can use this observation to make informed predictions about when new computing innovations may become available, they cannot accurately predict the exact dates with certainty.\n\nOption B is incorrect because doubling the costs of new products each time advances in processing speed occur does not make sense in the context of the observation. The observation is about processing speeds, not costs.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while processing speed improvements can be a factor in the development of new processors, it is not the only factor. There are many other factors that can influence processor development, such as energy efficiency, cost, and performance per watt.",
