Scenario 1 | I relaxed naked in the schoolyard, to get a nice tan. Scenario 2 | I put trick candles on my cousin's cake because he loves jokes.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:In Scenario 1, the main character is doing something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Nudity in a schoolyard, especially for the purpose of tanning, can be considered indecent exposure or public indecency. This behavior violates social norms and can be seen as disrespectful to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character places trick candles on their cousin's cake as a joke. While this may not be everyone's sense of humor, it is not morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. People often engage in harmless pranks and jokes with family and friends, which are a part of everyday social interactions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
