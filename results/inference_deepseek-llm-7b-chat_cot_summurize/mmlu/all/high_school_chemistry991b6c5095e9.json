Electrons originally from which subshell would have the highest velocity after being ejected?\n\nA. 1s\nB. 2p\nC. 3p\nD. 3d\n\nassistant:The question is related to the process of photoelectric effect, which is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material, in this case neutral atoms of chlorine, when they are subjected to high-energy photons. The answer to the question depends on the energy of the photon and the shell structure of the atom.\n\nIn general, the energy required to eject an electron from an atom depends on the shell structure of the atom. The electron shells are arranged in increasing energy levels, with the first shell (1s) being the lowest energy shell and the last shell (3d) being the highest energy shell.\n\nWhen the energy of the photon is higher than the threshold energy required to eject an electron from a given shell, the electrons will be ejected from the atoms. The threshold energy for each shell is different, with the 1s shell having the lowest threshold energy and the 3d shell having the highest threshold energy.\n\nTherefore, the electrons originally from the 1s subshell would have the lowest velocity after being ejected, while the electrons originally from the 3d subshell would have the highest velocity.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1s",
