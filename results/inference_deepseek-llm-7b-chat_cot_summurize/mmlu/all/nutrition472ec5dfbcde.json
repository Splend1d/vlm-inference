For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\n\nThis statement is correct because it emphasizes that the body can synthesize its own amino acids from existing protein, which means that a small amount of protein intake is necessary to meet the body's needs. The other options are incorrect because they either ignore the importance of individual amino acids or suggest that all dietary proteins are the same, which is not true.",
