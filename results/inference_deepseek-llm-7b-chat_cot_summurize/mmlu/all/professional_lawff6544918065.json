Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that there is newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent.\n\nassistant:The best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment in this situation would be option A. Moving for a new trial or in the alternative for remittitur to reduce the award in light of the shortened duration of the plaintiff's injuries. This is because the videotape showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor indicates that her injuries may not be permanent. This would be a valid ground for seeking a reduction in the damages awarded to the plaintiff.",
