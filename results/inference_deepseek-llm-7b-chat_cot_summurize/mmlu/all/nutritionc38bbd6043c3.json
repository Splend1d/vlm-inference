Glucagon increases the rate of glycolysis\nB. Glycolysis requires NADP+\nC. In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products\nD. The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate\n\nassistant:D. The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate.\n\nThis statement is correct because in red blood cells, glycolysis is the primary source of energy for cellular respiration. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules, which are then transported to the mitochondria for further processing. The end-product of this process is two molecules of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water, along with the production of energy in the form of ATP.",
