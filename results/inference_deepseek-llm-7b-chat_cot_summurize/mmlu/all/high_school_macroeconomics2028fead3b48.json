An increase in the real interest rate.\n\nWhen the Fed implements an easy money policy by lowering interest rates, it can lead to an increase in the money supply. This increase in the money supply can lead to an increase in the price level (inflation) and a decrease in the real interest rate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an increase in the money supply can lead to a decrease in net exports, not an increase. Option B is also incorrect because a decrease in net exports is more likely to occur when the money supply is tightened (interest rates are raised) rather than when it is expanded (interest rates are lowered). Option D is incorrect because the nominal interest rate is not directly influenced by an easy money policy by the Fed.",
