Nebular hypothesis.\n\nThe nebular hypothesis is a theory that explains how the solar system formed. According to this hypothesis, the Sun and other objects in the solar system originated from a vast rotating cloud of gas and dust. This cloud, known as a nebula, collapsed under its own gravity, forming the Sun and the planets.",
