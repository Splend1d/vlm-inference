Nop sled is a term used in computer security and reverse engineering to refer to a sequence of NOP (No Operation) instructions. NOP instructions are used to simulate the execution of a machine code instruction, but have no effect on the program's operation. A nop sled is a sequence of NOP instructions followed by shellcode, which is a set of machine code instructions that is used to execute malicious code or perform unauthorized actions on a system. The nop sled is used to make it difficult for an attacker to detect the presence of malicious code, as the nop sled appears to be a normal sequence of instructions and does not raise any security alerts.",
