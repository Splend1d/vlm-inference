A summary of Sussman's January activities follows: Credit sales of $5600. Collections of $1900 relating to January credit sales. Accrued salaries of $1200. By what amount will Sussman's cash-basis income for the month ended January 31 increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis of accounting?\n\nA. $2,500\nB. $3,700\nC. $4,400\nD. 4900\n\nassistant:To calculate the cash-basis income on the accrual basis, we will adjust the January activities as follows:\n\n1. Credit sales of $5600 will be recorded as a liability on the accrual basis until they are collected. Therefore, the cash-basis equivalent of $5600 credit sales is $0 since there is no cash exchanged.\n2. Collections of $1900 will be recorded as revenue on the accrual basis. Therefore, the cash-basis equivalent of $1900 collections is $1900 since it is cash received.\n3. Accrued salaries of $1200 will be recorded as an expense on the accrual basis. Therefore, the cash-basis equivalent of $1200 accrued salaries is $1200 since it is cash paid.\n\nNow, we will calculate the difference between the cash-basis and accrual-basis income:\nCash-basis income = $0 (credit sales) + $1900 (collections) + $1200 (accrued salaries) = $3100\nAccrual-basis income = $0 (credit sales) + $1900 (collections) + $1200 (accrued salaries) = $3100\n\nThe difference between the two incomes is $0, which means that there will be no change in the cash-basis income as a result of restating the activities to the accrual basis of accounting. The correct answer is D. 4900.",
