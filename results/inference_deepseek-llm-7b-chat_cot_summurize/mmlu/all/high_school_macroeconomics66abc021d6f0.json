Wages\nB. Salaries\nC. Interest\nD. Depreciation of physical capital\n\nassistant:D. Depreciation of physical capital is not an addition to national income.\n\nNational income is a measure of the value of all the goods and services produced within a country during a specific period, such as a year. It is calculated by adding together the value of all the goods and services produced, known as gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nA. Wages and B. Salaries are both additions to national income because they are part of the value of goods and services produced within the country. Wages are paid to workers for their labor, and salaries are paid to employees for their work.\n\nC. Interest is also an addition to national income because it represents the value of money borrowed and repaid within the country. When a person borrows money and pays it back with interest, the interest paid is an addition to national income.\n\nD. Depreciation of physical capital, on the other hand, is not an addition to national income. Physical capital refers to the equipment, machinery, and other fixed assets used in production. Depreciation is the decrease in the value of these assets over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, and other factors. Because depreciation represents a decrease in the value of assets, it is not an addition to national income.",
