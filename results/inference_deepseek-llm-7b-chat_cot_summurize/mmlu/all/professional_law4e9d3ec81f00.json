Which of the following constitutional provisions would provide the best rationale for the enactment of this federal statute?\n\nA. Under Article I, Congress has the power to enact laws that are \"necessary and proper\" to the general welfare.\nB. The enforcement provision of Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment.\nC. The enforcement provision of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nassistant:The best rationale for the enactment of this federal statute is C. The enforcement provision of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This provision gives Congress the power to enforce laws that protect citizens from discrimination based on their race. The statute in question is designed to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale, transfer, or rental of real estate, and the Fourteenth Amendment provides the necessary authority for Congress to enact such a law.\n\nA. Under Article I, Congress has the power to enact laws that are \"necessary and proper\" to the general welfare. While this provision does give Congress some power, it is not as specific or clear-cut as the Fourteenth Amendment, and therefore would not provide as strong a rationale for the enactment of this particular statute.\n\nB. The enforcement provision of Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment deals with the prohibition of slavery and involuntary servitude, and does not specifically address racial discrimination in the sale, transfer, or rental of real estate. Therefore, it would not be the best rationale for this particular statute.\n\nD. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment deals with the protection of citizens' rights to fair and just treatment in legal proceedings, and does not specifically address racial discrimination in the sale, transfer, or rental of real estate. Therefore, it would not be the best rationale for this particular statute.",
