The statement should be allowed, because although the driver was in custody, the officer's spontaneous utterance upon smelling alcohol did not rise to the level of interrogation.\n\nThe court should rule that the driver's statement admitting his drinking should be allowed in the prosecution's case-in-chief. Although the driver was in custody and the officer's question was prompted by the officer's observation of the strong odor of alcohol, the statement was not elicited through formal interrogation. The officer's question was spontaneous and not intended to elicit a confession or admission from the driver. Therefore, the statement should not be suppressed.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the driver was in custody and the officer's question was not a spontaneous utterance. Option C is incorrect because the statement should not be suppressed if it was not formally elicited through interrogation. Option D is incorrect because the statement should not be suppressed in the prosecution's case-in-chief, but it may be used as impeachment evidence if the driver testifies.",
