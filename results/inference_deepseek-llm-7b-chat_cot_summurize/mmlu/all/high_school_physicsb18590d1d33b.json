After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck?\n\nA. The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.\nB. The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.\nC. The net force is in the positive direction, because the student\u2019s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.\nD. The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n\nThe student pushes the puck from position x = 0 to position x = 0.2 m, so the puck gains some initial velocity. As the puck continues to move, it gains more velocity and eventually comes to rest at position x = 1.2 m. During this motion, the puck experiences friction, which acts in the opposite direction of the net force. The force of friction acts to slow down the puck, while the net force acting on the puck is zero. Therefore, the net force on the puck is zero, and option D is the correct answer.",
