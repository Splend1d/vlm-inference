According to a report by SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), China's military expenditure was 156 billion US dollars in 2017. To calculate the percentage of GDP, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Military Expenditure / GDP) x 100\n\nUsing the data from the report, we can estimate the percentage of China's GDP spent on the military in 2017 as follows:\n\nPercentage = (156 billion US dollars / 11.2 trillion US dollars) x 100\nPercentage \u2248 1.38%\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to your question would be option A. 0.50%. However, please note that this is an estimate and may not be accurate to the nearest percentage point.",
