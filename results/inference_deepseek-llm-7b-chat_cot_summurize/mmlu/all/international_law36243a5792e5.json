No, there are no limits to article 103\nB. Yes, Article 103 cannot trump multilateral treaties\nC. Yes, article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms\nD. Yes, when a case is submitted to the ICJ, article 103 ceases to have any effect\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nA. No, there are no limits to article 103\n- Article 103 of the UN Charter is the provision on the competence of the Security Council. It outlines the Council's power to take action in cases of threat to peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. This option does not specify any limitations, but it is important to note that the UN Charter does provide other limitations on the Council's powers.\n\nB. Yes, Article 103 cannot trump multilateral treaties\n- This statement is partially correct. Article 103 of the UN Charter does not allow the Security Council to violate the provisions of a treaty signed by the UN. However, it does not mean that Article 103 can never trump multilateral treaties. The Council can still act in cases of a threat to peace, breach of peace, or aggression, even if such actions may violate multilateral treaties.\n\nC. Yes, article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms\n- This statement is correct. Article 103 of the UN Charter is subordinate to general principles of law recognized by the international community, including jus cogens norms. This means that if a decision of the ICJ or a general assembly resolution establishes that a certain action is a jus cogens norm, the Security Council must abide by that norm, even if it is in violation of Article 103.\n\nD. Yes, when a case is submitted to the ICJ, article 103 ceases to have any effect\n- This statement is not entirely accurate. Article 103 of the UN Charter does not automatically cease to have any effect when a case is submitted to the ICJ. The ICJ's advisory opinion and decisions on cases are not binding on the Security Council. However, the Council must take the ICJ's opinion into consideration when deciding on a matter.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms",
