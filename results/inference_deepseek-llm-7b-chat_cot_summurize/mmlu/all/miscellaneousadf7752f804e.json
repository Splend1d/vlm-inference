So, the correct option is:\n\nA. one hour forward\n\nI will now justify my answer by explaining the process of daylight-saving time. Daylight-saving time is a practice where the clocks are set forward by one hour during the spring to make better use of daylight during the evening. This adjustment usually occurs on the second Sunday of March in the United States.\n\nTherefore, when daylight-saving time arrives in the spring, most Americans need to turn their clocks one hour forward.",
