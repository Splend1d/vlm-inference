Here are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. Determine the average BMI of vegetarians: To do this, we need to find the BMI of a representative sample of vegetarians and calculate their average BMI.\n2. Determine the average BMI of meat-eaters: To do this, we need to find the BMI of a representative sample of meat-eaters and calculate their average BMI.\n3. Compare the two averages: To do this, we need to subtract the average BMI of vegetarians from the average BMI of meat-eaters.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that the difference in average BMI between vegetarians and meat-eaters is 1 unit of BMI, which corresponds to option C.",
