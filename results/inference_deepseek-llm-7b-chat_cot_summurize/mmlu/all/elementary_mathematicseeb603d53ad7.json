Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim. Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector. How many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\n\nA. 2\nB. 3\nC. 5\nD. 12\n\nassistant:Let's represent the positions of the students as numbers from 1 to 7, where 1 is Hector's position, 2 is Kim's position, 3 is Tonya's position, and so on.\n\nHector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, so Hector's position is Kim's position + 2.\nTonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, so Tonya's position is Hector's position + 3.\n\nNow let's find the position of Tonya in relation to Kim's position:\n\nTonya's position = Hector's position + 3\nTonya's position = Kim's position + 2 + 3\nTonya's position = Kim's position + 5\n\nThe question asks how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit, so we need to find the difference between Kim's position and Tonya's position:\n\nKim's position - Tonya's position = 7 - (Kim's position + 5) = 7 - (Kim's position) - 5 = 2\n\nTherefore, Kim sits 2 seats to the left of Tonya. The correct answer is A. 2.",
