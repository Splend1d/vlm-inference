In the first scenario, the main character leaves the hotel room's bed messy, which is generally seen as a minor inconvenience rather than a clear moral wrong. In the second scenario, the main character encourages the politician to sleep on their proposal, which is a more serious act, and could be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
