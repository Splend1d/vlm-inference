It will not be consistent\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. It will be consistent and unbiased but not efficient.\n\nWhen there is multicollinearity in the data, the OLS estimator is still consistent, meaning that it converges to the true parameter values as the sample size increases. However, it is not efficient, meaning that there exists another estimator with a smaller variance that also converges to the true parameter values. The OLS estimator is also unbiased, meaning that it is centered around the true parameter value.",
