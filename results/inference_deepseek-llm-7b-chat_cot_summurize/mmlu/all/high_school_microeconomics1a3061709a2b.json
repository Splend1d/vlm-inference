In the context of the options provided, only option B, a social security retirement income, can be considered an example of an economic rent. This is because social security payments are based on the individual's contributions to the system during their working years and are intended to provide a stable source of income in retirement. The other options are not considered economic rents because they are not payments made for the use of a scarce resource.",
