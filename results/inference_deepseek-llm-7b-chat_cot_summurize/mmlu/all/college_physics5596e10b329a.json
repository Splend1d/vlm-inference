The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\n\nA. 100%\nB. 75%\nC. 50%\nD. 25%\n\nassistant:Let's use the formula for the transmission of linearly polarized light through two polarizers:\n\nTransmitted intensity = (Incident intensity * Transmission of first polarizer) * (Transmission of second polarizer)\n\nWe know that the transmission axes of the polarizers make an angle of 45q with each other. This means that the light is partially polarized.\n\nFirst, let's find the transmission of the first polarizer:\n\nTransmission of first polarizer = sin(45q) / sin(q)\n\nSince sin(45q) = \u221a2 / 2, the transmission of the first polarizer is:\n\nTransmission of first polarizer = (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(q)\n\nNext, let's find the transmission of the second polarizer:\n\nTransmission of second polarizer = sin(q) / sin(45q)\n\nSince sin(q) = \u221a2 / 2, the transmission of the second polarizer is:\n\nTransmission of second polarizer = (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(45q)\n\nNow, let's find the transmitted intensity:\n\nTransmitted intensity = (Incident intensity * (Transmission of first polarizer)) * (Transmission of second polarizer)\n\n= (Incident intensity * (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(q)) * (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(45q)\n\n= (\u221a2 / 2) * (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(q) * sin(45q)\n\n= (2 / 2) * (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(q) * (\u221a2 / 2)\n\n= 1 * (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(q)\n\n= (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(q)\n\nSo, the transmitted intensity is (\u221a2 / 2) / sin(q), which is not equal to any of the given options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed in the options.",
