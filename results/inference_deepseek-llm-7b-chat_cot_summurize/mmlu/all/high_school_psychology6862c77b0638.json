This system is responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response, which helps the body prepare to deal with a sudden and potentially dangerous situation.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system activates the adrenal glands to release adrenaline, which increases heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. This helps to prepare the body for a quick response to the shock or surprise. The other options listed do play a role in the body's response to stress, but they are not as directly involved in the \"fight or flight\" response as the sympathetic nervous system.",
