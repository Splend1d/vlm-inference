Which of the following could change the angular momentum of the man-platform system?\n\nA. The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend.\nB. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body\nC. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body, and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again.\nD. The man jumps straight up in the air and lands back on the platform.\n\nassistant:The answer is C. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body, and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again.\n\nWhen the man thrusts his arms out away from his body, his mass will shift towards the platform's center of mass. This change in mass distribution will cause a change in the system's angular momentum. When he brings his arms back to his side again, the mass distribution will return to its original state, but the change in angular momentum has already occurred.\n\nIn options A and D, the man is not changing his mass distribution relative to the platform's center of mass, so they do not change the angular momentum of the system. In option B, the man thrusts his arms out, but then brings them back to his side without changing their angle, so the change in mass distribution is not enough to affect the system's angular momentum.",
