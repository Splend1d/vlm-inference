The number decreased, but not by nearly enough to meet the Summit's goal.\n\nSince the 1996 World Food Summit, the number of food insecure people in the world has decreased, but it has not reached the goal of cutting the number of hungry people in half by 2015. The Summit's goal was to reduce the number of undernourished people by 100 million by 2015, but it was not achieved. The number of food insecure people has decreased, but not by a significant amount.",
