This is consistent with Down syndrome and is a diagnostic karyotype.\n\nB. 47,XY,+13: This karyotype has a numerical excess of 13 chromosomes, which is not characteristic of Down syndrome.\n\nC. 45,XX,rob,(14;21)(q10;q10): This karyotype has a Robertsonian translocation (rob) involving chromosomes 21 and 22, but it does not have the characteristic deletion of the long arm of chromosome 21 that is diagnostic of Down syndrome.\n\nD. 46,XY,t(2;3)(q21;q12): This karyotype has a chromosomal translocation involving chromosomes 2 and 3, which is not characteristic of Down syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 46,XX,der(14;21)(q10;q10)pat+21.",
