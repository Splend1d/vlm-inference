A given change in government spending would have had a more powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2.\n\nThe increase in the marginal propensity to consume from 0.75 to 0.80 indicates that for every dollar of additional government spending, less of it is likely to be saved and more is likely to be used for consumption. This means that the increase in government spending will have a larger positive impact on real output in year 1, as compared to year 2. The other options are not supported by the information given.",
