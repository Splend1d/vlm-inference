The equation of the torus can be obtained by integrating the equation of the sphere over the surface of the torus.\n\nThe equation of the sphere is given by:\n(y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nLet's solve this for z:\nz^2 = 1 - (y - 3)^2\nz = \u00b1\u221a(1 - (y - 3)^2)\n\nNow, let's parameterize the torus using two angles, \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03b8 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0 and \u03c6 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nLet x = r * cos(\u03b8)\nLet y = r * sin(\u03b8)\nLet z = R * cos(\u03c6)\n\nSince the equation of the sphere is in cylindrical coordinates, we can transform it to spherical coordinates by using the following relations:\nx = r * cos(\u03b8)\ny = r * sin(\u03b8)\nz = R * cos(\u03c6)\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the equation of the sphere:\n(r * sin(\u03b8))^2 + (R * cos(\u03c6))^2 = 1\n\nSince r and R are constants, we can remove them from the equation:\nsin^2(\u03b8) + cos^2(\u03c6) = 1\n\nThis equation represents a sphere with radius R in the \u03b8-\u03c6 plane. To find the equation of the torus, we need to integrate this equation over the surface of the torus.\n\nThe surface of the torus can be parameterized by two angles, \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03b8 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0 and \u03c6 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nLet's parameterize the torus using two angles, \u03b8 and \u03c6:\nx = R * cos(\u03b8)\ny = R * sin(\u03b8)\nz = R * cos(\u03c6)\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the equation of the sphere:\n(R * sin(\u03b8))^2 + (R * cos(\u03c6))^2 = 1\n\nSince R is a constant, we can remove it from the equation:\nsin^2(\u03b8) + cos^2(\u03c6) = 1\n\nThis equation represents a sphere with radius R in the \u03b8-\u03c6 plane.

The equation of the torus in cylindrical coordinates is given by:\n\nx = r * cos(\u03b8)\ny = r * sin(\u03b8)\nz = R * cos(\u03c6)\n\nNow, let's find the Jacobian determinant of the transformation from cylindrical coordinates to spherical coordinates. The Jacobian determinant is given by:\n\nJ = (r * sin(\u03b8)) * (R * sin(\u03c6)) - (R * cos(\u03c6)) * (r * cos(\u03b8))\n\nThe surface of the torus can be parameterized by two angles, \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03b8 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0 and \u03c6 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nLet's parameterize the torus using two angles, \u03b8 and \u03c6:\nx = R * cos(\u03b8)\ny = R * sin(\u03b8)\nz = R * cos(\u03c6)\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the equation of the sphere:\n(R * sin(\u03b8))^2 + (R * cos(\u03c6))^2 = 1\n\nSince R is a constant, we can remove it from the equation:\nsin^2(\u03b8) + cos^2(\u03c6) = 1\n\nThis equation represents a sphere with radius R in the \u03b8-\u03c6 plane.
