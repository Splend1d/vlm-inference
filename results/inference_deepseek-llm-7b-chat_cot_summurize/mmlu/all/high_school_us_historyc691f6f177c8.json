Anthony?\n\nA. The temperance movement.\nB. Utopian communities.\nC. The abolition movement.\nD. Public school advocates.\n\nassistant:Susan B. Anthony, an influential figure in the nineteenth-century women's suffrage movement, made similar arguments to those written by Martin Luther King, Jr. in his \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\" In her fight for women's rights, Anthony often emphasized the interconnectedness of all communities and the need for individuals to take action against injustice.\n\nOne reform movement that also made similar arguments was the abolition movement. Abolitionists, such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, also emphasized the interconnectedness of communities and the need for individuals to take action against injustice. They argued that slavery was a threat to the freedom and equality of all people, regardless of race or gender.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The abolition movement.",
