How much money is created in new loans from all banks after this bank receives a deposit of $1000 ?\n\nA. $800 \nB. $1,000 \nC. $4,000 \nD. $5,000\n\nassistant:Let's think step-by-step to solve this problem.\n\n1. The bank receives a deposit of $1000.\n2. To calculate how much money is created in new loans, we need to consider the reserve requirement and the multiplier effect.\n3. The reserve requirement is 20 percent, meaning that banks must hold 20 percent of the total deposits as reserves. So, 20 percent of $1000 is $200.\n4. The remaining 80 percent of the deposit is available for lending, which is $1000 - $200 = $800.\n5. The multiplier effect states that each dollar of reserve creates an additional $1 worth of loans. So, $800 * $1 = $800.\n6. Therefore, the total amount of money created in new loans is $800.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. $800.",
