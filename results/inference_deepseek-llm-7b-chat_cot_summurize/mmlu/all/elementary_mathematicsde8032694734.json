Her original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long. If the new, larger picture is 10 cm wide, what is its length?\n\nA. 8 cm\nB. 12 cm\nC. 15 cm\nD. 20 cm\n\nassistant:Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long.\n2. Miranda enlarged the picture proportionally, so the width of the new picture is 10 cm.\n3. To find the length of the new picture, we can use the proportion of width to length. In other words, if the width is 10 cm, the length can be found by dividing 10 by the width.\n\nSo the length of the new picture is 10 cm / 4 cm = 2.5 times the length of the original picture.\n\nSince the original picture is 6 cm long, the new picture will be 2.5 * 6 = 15 cm long.\n\nSo the answer is C. 15 cm.",
