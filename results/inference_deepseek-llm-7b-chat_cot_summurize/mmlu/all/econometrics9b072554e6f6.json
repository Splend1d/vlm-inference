All of them\nB. The largest 2\nC. The smallest 2\nD. The second largest\n\nassistant:The Johansen \"trace\" test is used to test for cointegration among multiple variables, and it involves using the eigenvalues of the information matrix to determine the number of cointegrating vectors.\n\nWhen applying the Johansen \"trace\" test to a system containing 4 variables, you would only use the largest 2 eigenvalues, as these correspond to the number of cointegrating vectors. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The largest 2",
