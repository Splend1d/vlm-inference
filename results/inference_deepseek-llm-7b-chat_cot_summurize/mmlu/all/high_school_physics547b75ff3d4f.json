If the astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, how much will he weigh on this planet?\n\nA. 200 N\nB. 400 N\nC. 800 N\nD. 1600 N\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the formula for weight (W) in a gravitational field (g):\n\nW = mg\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and the symbol is the gravitational constant (which is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2).\n\nFirst, we need to find the acceleration due to gravity on this planet. Since the mass and radius are each twice that of Earth, the acceleration due to gravity will be:\n\ng' = 2 * g\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the astronaut's mass (800 N) and the acceleration due to gravity on the planet (2 * g) to find his weight on the planet:\n\nW' = 800 N * 2 * g\nW' = 1600 N\n\nThe astronaut will weigh 1600 N on this planet. The closest answer choice is D. 1600 N.",
