Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character does something clearly morally wrong in both scenarios. In Scenario 1, leaving the dog at the park is not a clear violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, but it can be seen as neglectful or irresponsible. In Scenario 2, baking a friend's children for Easter Sunday is morally wrong, as it involves cruelty and endangers the children's health. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
