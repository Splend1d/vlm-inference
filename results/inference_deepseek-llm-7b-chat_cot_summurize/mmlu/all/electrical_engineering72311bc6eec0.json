Closed loop control system.\n\nAn open loop control system is a system in which there is no feedback mechanism to correct any deviations from the desired output. In contrast, a closed loop control system includes a feedback mechanism that allows the system to correct any deviations from the desired output. Therefore, it is also known as an automatic control system.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is not a valid choice. Option D is incorrect because it contradicts the correct answer.
