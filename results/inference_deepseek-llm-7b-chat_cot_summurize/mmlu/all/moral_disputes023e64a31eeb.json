This can be seen as a violation of the right to privacy, as it implies that certain viewpoints are considered more valid or important than others. Therefore, those who value a strong right to privacy would likely find this type of restriction troubling.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Altman's viewpoint-biased speech restriction does not necessarily conflict with strong protections for freedom of speech. While it may be seen as limiting the freedom of speech, it is not necessarily a direct conflict.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is not relevant to the issue at hand. The question is not about valuing or not valuing strong protections for freedom of speech, but rather about who would find a viewpoint-biased speech restriction troubling.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the equal educational opportunity does not have any direct connection with Altman's viewpoint-biased speech restriction.",
