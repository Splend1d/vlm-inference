Analyte molecules are converted to gaseous ions.\nThis statement is correct. In mass spectrometry, the sample is ionized, converting the analyte molecules into gaseous ions.\n\n2. The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio.\nThis statement is also correct. In mass spectrometry, the ions are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio, allowing for the identification and quantification of different ions.\n\n3. In addition to compound identification, mass spectra can be utilized to determine precise isotopic masses and isotopic ratios.\nThis statement is also correct. Mass spectrometry can be used to determine the precise isotopic masses and isotopic ratios of different elements, providing valuable information about the chemical composition of a sample.\n\nBased on my analysis, all three statements are characteristic of mass spectrometry. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\nD. I, II, and III",
