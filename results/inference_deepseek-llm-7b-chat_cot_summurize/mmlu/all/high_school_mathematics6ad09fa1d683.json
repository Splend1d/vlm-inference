You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The positive square root of 200 is what percent larger than the positive square root of 121? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\n\nA. 29\nB. 14\nC. 27\nD. 11\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to calculate the positive square roots of 200 and 121, and then find the percentage difference between them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the positive square roots:\n\u221a200 \u2248 14.14\n\u221a121 \u2248 11.0\n\nNow, let's find the percentage difference:\nPercentage difference = (Difference between the two square roots) / (Positive square root of 121) * 100\nPercentage difference = (14.14 - 11.0) / 11.0 * 100 \u2248 29.09\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the answer is approximately 29. Therefore, the positive square root of 200 is approximately 29% larger than the positive square root of 121. The closest answer choice is A.",
