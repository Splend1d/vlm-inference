In this case, the 17-year-old driver is following the speed limit to avoid causing harm or engaging in risky behavior that could result in a crash. The other options (A, B, and C) do not directly demonstrate Kohlberg's conventional level of morality as they do not necessarily involve societal norms or rules.",
