Which of the following terms best describes this?\n\nA. artificial selection\nB. directional selection\nC. stabilizing selection\nD. disruptive selection\n\nassistant:The term that best describes this is D. Disruptive selection.\n\nDisruptive selection refers to a type of natural selection in which individuals with a certain trait fall below the average fitness level, resulting in a decrease in the frequency of that trait in the population. In this case, starlings that produce fewer or more eggs than the average of four to five eggs have reduced fitness, which means they are less likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. This type of selection is different from other types of selection, such as stabilizing selection, which leads to a balance between two different traits, or directional selection, which leads to the increase or decrease of a trait over time.",
