You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Up to isomorphism, how many additive abelian groups G of order 16 have the property that x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G ?\n\nA. 0\nB. 1\nC. 2\nD. 3\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 16 has a unique structure up to isomorphism (i.e., it is unique up to bijective mappings).\n2. An abelian group is a group in which every element has a finite number of positive and negative multiples.\n3. The additive group of integers modulo 16 is an abelian group of order 16.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given condition: x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G. This condition is equivalent to (x + 0) + (x + 0) + (x + 0) + (x + 0) = 4x + 0 = 4x = 0. This equation holds for all x in G if and only if G is the additive group of integers modulo 16, which has 16 elements.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 additive abelian group of order 16 with the given property:\n\nG = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\n\nThe answer is B.",
