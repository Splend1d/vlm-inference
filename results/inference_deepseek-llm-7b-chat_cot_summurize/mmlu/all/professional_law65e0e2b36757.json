The shopper brought suit against the owner of the entire building. The owner claimed that since he leased the cafeteria, he no longer retained any control over the connecting hallway.

The fact that the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid two days after the accident shows that they were aware of the unsafe condition and took action to fix it, which could be considered negligence. The fact that the owner leased the cafeteria does not absolve them of responsibility for maintaining the safety of the connecting hallway. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.",
