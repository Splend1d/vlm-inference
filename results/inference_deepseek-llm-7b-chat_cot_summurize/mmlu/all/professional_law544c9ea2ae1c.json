No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.\n\nThe parties have entered into a contract for the purchase of 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF, which includes the loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes. The court would likely interpret the offer terms CIF as meaning cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) including all loading charges, and therefore, the contract would be for $1,500 (the original offer price of $1,000 plus the $50 loading charge per thousand envelopes).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the court would likely interpret the offer terms CIF as including the loading charges, not excluding them.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the order confirmation was not a counteroffer, but rather a confirmation of the purchase order.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the purchase order was not the offer, but rather a confirmation of the offer.",
