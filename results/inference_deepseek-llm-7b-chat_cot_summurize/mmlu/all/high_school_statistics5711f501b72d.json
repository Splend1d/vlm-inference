Find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days.\n\nA. (3,034, 3,466)\nB. (2,930, 3,570)\nC. (2,610, 3,890)\nD. (2,450, 4,050)\n\nassistant:The middle 50 percent of days refers to the middle half of the data, since the data is normally distributed. So, we want to find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores for the middle 50 percent. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The z-score for the middle 50 percent is calculated as follows:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the value of the z-score, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the middle 50 percent, we can assume that there are 250 customers on either side of the middle, so the lower limit is \u03bc - 2 * \u03c3 and the upper limit is \u03bc + 2 * \u03c3.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nz = (3,250 - 320) / 320\nz = 10 / 320\nz \u2248 0.03125\n\nFor the lower limit:\n\n\u03bc - 2 * \u03c3 = 3,250 - 2 * 320\n\u03bc - 2 * \u03c3 = 2,630\n\nFor the upper limit:\n\n\u03bc + 2 * \u03c3 = 3,250 + 2 * 320\n\u03bc + 2 * \u03c3 = 3,770\n\nNow, we can find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days:\n\n(\u03bc - 2 * \u03c3) to (\u03bc + 2 * \u03c3) = (2,630, 2,950) to (3,770, 3,570)\n\nNone of the given options match this range, so it seems there may have been an error in the problem statement or the options provided.",
