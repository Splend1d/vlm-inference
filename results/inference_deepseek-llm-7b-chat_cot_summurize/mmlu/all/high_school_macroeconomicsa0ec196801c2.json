Further suppose that a Big Mac costs 3 dollars in America; 2 pounds in England; 50 pesos in Mexico; and 200 yuan in China. In which country is a Big Mac most expensive?\n\nA. America ($3).\nB. England ($4).\nC. Mexico ($5).\nD. China ($2).\n\nassistant:To determine which country a Big Mac is most expensive, we can use the given exchange rates to convert the prices in each country to a common currency (USD). Then we can compare the prices in USD.\n\n1. Convert English Pound to USD: 0.5 GBP = 0.5/1.28 USD (exchange rate GBP to USD)\n2. Convert Mexican Pesos to USD: 10 MXN = 10/17.07 USD (exchange rate MXN to USD)\n3. Convert Chinese Yuan to USD: 100 CNY = 100/6.46 USD (exchange rate CNY to USD)\n\nNow, we can compare the prices in USD:\n\n- America: 3 USD\n- England: 0.5/1.28 * 3 USD = 1.27 USD\n- Mexico: 50/17.07 * 3 USD = 4.2 USD\n- China: 200/6.46 * 3 USD = 7.57 USD\n\nThe Big Mac is most expensive in China, with a price of 7.57 USD. So the answer is D. China.",
