You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A defendant charged with first-degree murder shall be furnished with a list containing names and addresses of all prospective jurors\n\nA. upon court order.\nB. upon request.\nC. upon request and showing of good cause.\nD. under no circumstances.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. upon request.\n\nIn the United States, when a defendant is charged with a serious crime such as first-degree murder, they have the right to a fair trial, which includes the selection of an impartial jury. The process of selecting a jury is called the \"voir dire\" process. In this process, both the prosecution and the defense have the opportunity to question potential jurors to ensure that they are impartial and able to fulfill their duty to decide the case based on the evidence and the law, without bias or prejudice.\n\nThe defense has the right to request a list of potential jurors, including their names and addresses. This list is known as the \"voir diaries\" or \"jury lists.\" The court is required to provide this list to the defense upon request, unless there is a good cause not to do so. This is to ensure that the defense is able to adequately prepare for the trial and select the jurors they believe are most likely to be fair and impartial.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"A defendant charged with first-degree murder shall be furnished with a list containing names and addresses of all prospective jurors\" is correct, but it is incomplete. The court is required to provide the list upon request, but the defense may also be required to show good cause for their request.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. upon request.",
