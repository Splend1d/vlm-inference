Brighter.\n\nWhen traveling north from the United States into Canada, you will see the North Star (Polaris) getting brighter as you move further north. This is because the angle between the Earth's surface and the North Star becomes smaller as you travel north, allowing more of its light to reach your eyes. The other options are incorrect because the North Star does not rise higher or lower in the sky, and it does not get dimmer as you travel north.",
