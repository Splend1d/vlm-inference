Therefore, the correct answer is A. The number of \"good genes\" it possesses and the number of mates it attracts are not the most direct measures of Darwinian fitness. While physical strength may be correlated with Darwinian fitness, it is not the most direct measure. The survival and reproduction of offspring is the most direct way to measure an individual's contribution to the gene pool.",
