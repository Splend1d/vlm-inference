This fallacy occurs when someone attempts to persuade others to accept an idea or belief by appealing to their loyalty to a particular person or group. It is a form of argumentum ad verecundiam, where the credibility of the source is being used to persuade others rather than the quality of the argument.\n\nIn option C, the phrase \"an idea should be accepted only because of who originated the idea\" indicates that the argument is being made based on the person or group's reputation, rather than the merits of the idea itself. This can be seen as a form of prejudice or bias, where the idea is being accepted or rejected based on the person or group's status rather than the quality of the idea.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D do not describe the fallacy of appeal to loyalty. Option A is about being liked by others, option B is about derision, and option D is about loyalty to a person or group. These options do not involve the use of loyalty as a basis for accepting or rejecting an idea.",
