If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)\n\nA. 4.9 m\nB. 9.8 m\nC. 10.0 m\nD. 19.6 m\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\nh = (v^2) / (2 * g)\n\nwhere h is the height of the throw, v is the initial speed of the object, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of g. Since we are neglecting air resistance and assuming the ground is level, we can use the value of the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nh = (20^2) / (2 * 9.8)\nh = 400 / 19.6\nh \u2248 20.41\n\nHowever, this value is in meters. To convert it to meters, we multiply by 1000:\n\nh \u2248 20.41 * 1000\nh \u2248 20,410\n\nSo the height of the throw was approximately 20,410 meters. Since the options given are in meters, the closest answer is:\n\nC. 10.0 m",
