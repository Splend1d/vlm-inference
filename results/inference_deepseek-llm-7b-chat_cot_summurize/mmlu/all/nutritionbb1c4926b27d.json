Has been reported to be associated with a higher incidence of fracture and higher mortality in a few studies\nB. During puberty seems to be associated with higher bone mineral density in later life\nC. Is consistently associated with a lower rate of fractures\nD. In countries with the highest rate of fracture suggests that milk consumption is beneficial to the skeleton.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. In countries with the highest rate of fracture suggests that milk consumption is beneficial to the skeleton.\n\nStudies have shown that milk consumption is associated with a lower risk of fracture. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that women who consumed three or more glasses of milk per day had a 24% lower risk of fracture than those who drank less than one glass per week.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while milk consumption may be associated with a lower risk of fracture, it's not a guarantee. Other factors such as exercise, vitamin D intake, and overall health also play a role in bone health. Additionally, some studies have suggested that high milk consumption may be associated with an increased risk of fracture in some cases.",
