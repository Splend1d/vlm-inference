Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\n\nIn this situation, the debtor sold his car to the buyer, who agreed to pay the purchase price of $2,000 to the creditor \"in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor].\" This agreement between the buyer and the creditor is a contract that would be subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would not undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims. The statute of limitations would have already barred the creditor from recovering the debt from the debtor.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is not enforceable by the creditor. The creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties, such as the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor does not revive an uncollectible debt. The Statute of Frauds also applies to this situation, as the contract between the buyer and the creditor is not in writing, and therefore not enforceable.",
