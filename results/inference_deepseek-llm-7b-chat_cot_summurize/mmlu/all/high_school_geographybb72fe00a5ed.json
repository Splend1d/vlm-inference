Neo-Malthusianism is an economic theory that emphasizes the need to control population growth to avoid overpopulation and its associated problems such as poverty, famine, and environmental degradation. This theory has led to the development of various government programs aimed at promoting birth control and family planning, as well as planning for the sustainable use of natural resources. These programs have been implemented in many countries around the world, including China, India, and the United States. While neo-Malthusianism has been criticized for its potential to infringe on individual rights and promote a narrow conception of development, its influence on population control policies and programs is undeniable.",
