Your wand can make things warm or cold. Your wand doesn't actually change the temperature of things, but it can make you feel that way.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. illusions - This means something that isn't real, like a pretend castle. Your wand doesn't make the castle, so this doesn't fit.\n\nB. physical objects - This means something that can be touched, like a toy car. Your wand is not a car, so this doesn't fit either.\n\nC. only things existing apart from our minds - This means things that are not just in our thoughts, like a tree. Your wand is not a tree, so this doesn't fit either.\n\nD. only sensations existing in our minds - This means things that only happen in our thoughts, like a happy feeling. Your wand can make you feel warm or cold, so this fits!\n\nSo the answer is D. only sensations existing in our minds.",
