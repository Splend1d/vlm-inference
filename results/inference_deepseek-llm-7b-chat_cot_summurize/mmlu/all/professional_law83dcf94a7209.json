Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission.

Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n\nThe passage describes a situation where a man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral land, including a narrow concrete walkway adjoining the land, which was owned by the State Coastal Commission. The man enclosed the walkway and constructed a paddle ball court over the entire area without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession.\n\nTo establish title to the walkway area in an appropriate action, the man must show that the State Coastal Commission has lost its real property interest in the walkway area through adverse possession. Adverse possession is a legal concept that allows one party to acquire ownership of another's property through uninterrupted possession for a certain period of time, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction. In this case, the man has possessed the walkway area for an unspecified period in excess of the required period for adverse possession.\n\nOption A is not relevant to the situation because abandonment of a governmental entity's property interest does not occur without an official vote. Option B is not applicable because the man's possession of the walkway area is not based on a license but rather on adverse possession. Option D is also not relevant because there is no mention of a defect in the chain of title in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the man must establish that the State Coastal Commission has lost its real property interest in the walkway area through adverse possession in order to prevail in an appropriate action to establish title to the walkway area.",
