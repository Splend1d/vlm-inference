It is observed that a speaker frequency of 60 Hz does not produce standing waves in the string. Which explanation for this phenomenon is correct?\n\nA. The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\nB. The wave speed on the string is fixed.\nC. 60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound.\nD. The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz.\n\nassistant:The correct explanation for this phenomenon is A. The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\n\nWhen a vibrating speaker produces a wave, it is characterized by a specific frequency, which is the number of oscillations per unit time. In this case, the frequency of the wave produced by the speaker is 60 Hz. The standing wave phenomenon occurs when the string length is a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\n\nFor a wave to be stationary, the difference in phase between two points must be a multiple of two complete oscillations. This occurs when the distance between the points is a multiple of the half-wavelength of the wave. If the string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave, the wave will not be stationary, and no standing waves will be produced.\n\nIn this scenario, the string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker, which is why the standing wave phenomenon does not occur.",
