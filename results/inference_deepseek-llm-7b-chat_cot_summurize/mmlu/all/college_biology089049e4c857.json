The atmosphere\nB. Rain-forest vegetation\nC. Recoverable fossil fuels\nD. The oceans\n\nassistant:The answer is D. The oceans.\n\nThe oceans are the largest carbon reservoir on Earth, containing approximately 93% of the Earth's carbon. They are responsible for the largest carbon uptake and release events, including the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the formation of calcium carbonate in marine organisms and the release of carbon dioxide when these organisms die and decompose. The atmosphere, rainforest vegetation, and recoverable fossil fuels are smaller contributors to carbon cycling compared to the oceans.",
