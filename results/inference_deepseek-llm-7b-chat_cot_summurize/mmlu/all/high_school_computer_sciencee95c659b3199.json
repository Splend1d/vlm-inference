Tracking older versions of the software in case an error is found and the software needs to be reverted to an earlier form\nD. Translating a program written in an abstract, high-level language into a program with the same behavior expressed in machine code\n\nassistant:The role of the compiler in the process of developing executable software is to translate a program written in an abstract, high-level language into a program with the same behavior expressed in machine code. This process is called compilation. The compiler takes the source code written in a high-level programming language and converts it into an executable file that can be run on a computer. The compiler also performs other tasks such as error checking and optimization to improve the performance of the software.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Translating a program written in an abstract, high-level language into a program with the same behavior expressed in machine code.\n\nA. Managing specification files created as part of the development process: This is not the main role of the compiler.\nB. Running and testing the executable created by the programmer: This is not the main role of the compiler.\nC. Tracking older versions of the software in case an error is found and the software needs to be reverted to an earlier form: This is not the main role of the compiler.",
