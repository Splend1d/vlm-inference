The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract is the option that does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter. According to the contract, the man agreed to pay $250 per month for using the swimming pool. However, he stopped paying after he was involved in an accident and informed the swimming club about his inability to use the pool due to his injuries. This does not constitute a repudiation of the contract, which would give the club the right to sue him immediately. Instead, it is more accurate to say that the club has the right to sue the man for breach of contract after the due date of the next payment, as stated in option D.",
