What amount is Palmyra\u2019s comprehensive income?\n\nA. $4,000\nB. $10,000\nC. $11,000\nD. $17,000\n\nassistant:To calculate comprehensive income, we need to add up all the components and consider any changes in accounting principles.\n\n1. Net income is given as $11,000.\n2. Net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is given as a positive $1,000.\n3. Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities is given as a $3,000 loss.\n4. Foreign currency translation adjustment is given as a positive $2,000.\n5. Increase in common stock is given as a $6,000 increase.\n\nTo find the comprehensive income, we need to consider the change in accounting principle. Since net cumulative effect is positive, it means that the change in accounting principle resulted in a benefit. Therefore, we add the net cumulative effect to net income:\n\n$11,000 (net income) + $1,000 (net cumulative effect) = $12,000 (comprehensive income)\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, which is a non-operating item. We subtract the unrealized loss from the comprehensive income:\n\n$12,000 (comprehensive income) - $3,000 (unrealized loss) = $9,000 (final comprehensive income)\n\nAnswer: B. $10,000",
