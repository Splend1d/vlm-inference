The New Deal\nD. Reconstruction\n\nassistant:This question is about the historical context of desegregation of schools in the United States. The answer to this question is:\n\nB. The Square Deal\n\nThe Square Deal was a political platform proposed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1901. It aimed to reform various aspects of American society, including education, by promoting efficiency, equity, and social justice. The Square Deal emphasized the need for equal opportunities for all citizens and the importance of public education. However, it did not specifically address the issue of desegregation.\n\nThe Great Society, proposed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, was a broader social reform program that included initiatives for education, healthcare, and civil rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were part of this initiative, which aimed to address the issue of racial segregation and inequality in the United States.\n\nThe New Deal, a series of programs and initiatives launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, focused on economic recovery and social welfare programs, such as the Works Progress Administration and Social Security. While it improved the economic conditions of many Americans, it did not directly address the issue of racial segregation in schools.\n\nReconstruction, which occurred after the Civil War, aimed to rebuild the United States after the Civil War, establish the legal equality of African Americans, and provide them with new rights. However, the Reconstruction Era did not lead to the desegregation of schools, as it mainly focused on political and legal reforms.",
