Savagery, Barbarism, and Civilization.\n\nLewis Henry Morgan was an American anthropologist and sociologist who proposed a theory of human evolution, known as the \"three-stage theory.\" He believed that human societies developed through three distinct stages: savagery, barbarism, and civilization.\n\nSavagery is the earliest stage of human development, characterized by a hunter-gatherer lifestyle with no permanent settlements or social institutions. Barbarism is the second stage, in which societies begin to form permanent settlements and establish social institutions such as government and religion. Civilization is the final stage, characterized by advanced technology, complex social structures, and a focus on education and culture.\n\nMorgan's three-stage theory has been widely accepted and is still used today to understand the evolution of human societies.",
