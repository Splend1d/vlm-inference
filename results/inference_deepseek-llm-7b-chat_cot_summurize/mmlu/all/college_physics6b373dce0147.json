The time required for one revolution is\n\nA. independent of M\nB. proportional to m^(1/2)\nC. linear in R\nD. proportional to R^(3/2)\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. proportional to R^(3/2).\n\nTo find the time required for one revolution, we can use the formula for the period of a circular orbit:\n\nT = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{M}{E}}\n\nwhere T is the period, M is the mass of the planet, E is the total energy of the orbiting body, and \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{E}} is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nFor a satellite in a circular orbit, the total energy E is zero, so the formula becomes:\n\nT = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{M}{R}}\n\nTherefore, the time required for one revolution is proportional to R^(3/2).",
