Late one evening, she left the office and walked outside to her car. While in the parking lot, she noticed a gold watch lying on the ground. When the defendant picked it up, she immediately identified the watch as belonging to one of the other lawyers in her law firm. She took it home with her, intending to return it the next day. The following morning, however, the defendant decided to keep the watch, and did so. The defendant has committed\n\nA. larceny only.\nB. embezzlement only.\nC. both larceny and embezzlement.\nD. neither larceny nor embezzlement.\n\nassistant:The defendant in this scenario committed both larceny and embezzlement. \n\nLarceny, also known as theft, occurs when someone takes the property of another person with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. In this case, the defendant took the gold watch belonging to another person (a lawyer in her law firm) and intended to keep it, which is a form of larceny.\n\nEmbezzlement, on the other hand, is a type of theft that occurs when someone in a position of trust or authority misuses their position for their own benefit, such as a company's assets or funds. In this case, the defendant took the watch belonging to her law firm and intended to keep it, which can also be considered embezzlement.\n\nTherefore, the defendant has committed both larceny and embezzlement. The correct answer is C. both larceny and embezzlement.",
