Incorporate viral DNA into the host cell\u2019s chromosome\nB. Destroy the host cell\u2019s transcriptional machinery\nC. Replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins\nD. Use a viral copy of reverse transcriptase to manufacture viral DNA\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's go through the steps of the influenza virus lifecycle:\n\n1. An influenza virus enters a host cell (usually a respiratory cell) and attaches itself to the surface of the cell.\n2. The virus's outer shell (called the capsid) then fuses with the host cell's membrane, allowing the viral genetic material (RNA) to enter the host cell.\n3. Once inside the host cell, the viral RNA begins to copy itself, creating multiple copies of the viral genome.\n4. The host cell's transcriptional machinery is then used to synthesize viral proteins, which will later assemble into new viral particles.\n5. These new viral particles will then be released from the host cell and can continue the lifecycle by infecting more cells.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins",
