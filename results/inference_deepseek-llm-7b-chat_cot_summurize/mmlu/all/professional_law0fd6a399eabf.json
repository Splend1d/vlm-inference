In July, the landlord was killed in an accident. In August, the tenant brought an action against the administrator of the landlord's state. The tenant alleged that he and the landlord had a contract under the terms of which the landlord was supposed to pay him $50 a week to mow the lawn and perform small maintenance repairs for the other tenants. He claimed that the landlord had not paid him for the past six months. He testified that there was a written contract and that the landlord kept the only copy of it in his home. At trial, he called the landlord's accountant to testify about the contract. The accountant testified that she had seen the contract. She further testified about the terms of the contract, consistent with the tenant's testimony. She testified that the contract, along with many other documents pertaining to the landlord's business, had most likely been destroyed when the landlord's business office was robbed a few months earlier. The trial judge should rule that the accountant's. testimony is\n\nA. admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\nB. admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.\nC. inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\nD. inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nassistant:The trial judge should rule that the accountant's testimony is A. admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\n\nUnder the \"Dead Man's Statute,\" the accountant's testimony would be inadmissible because the landlord is no longer alive to testify. However, in this case, the accountant's testimony is considered \"secondary evidence\" because she had seen the contract and could testify to its terms. The fact that the contract was destroyed does not necessarily mean that the tenant is unable to prove the existence of the contract. Therefore, the accountant's testimony is admissible as secondary evidence.\n\nIn addition, the accountant's testimony is not inadmissible because it is not the best evidence. The best evidence rule requires that a party be allowed to use the original document to prove the terms of a contract. However, in this case, the tenant claims that he had a written contract, and the accountant testified that she had seen the contract and could testify to its terms. Therefore, the accountant's testimony is still considered \"good\" evidence, even if it is not the original document.",
