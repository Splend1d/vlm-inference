The act further prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. Congress claimed that the statute was passed because it might help deter illicit sexual relationships. The law is most likely\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a regulation of interstate commerce.\nB. constitutional, because it is a measure promoting the general welfare.\nC. unconstitutional, because the law deprives the manufacturers of contraceptives of their property interest without just compensation.\nD. unconstitutional, because it violates the right of privacy of contraceptive users.\n\nassistant:The law in question is likely unconstitutional because it violates the right of privacy of contraceptive users. The United States Constitution protects the right to privacy, which has been interpreted to include the right to make personal decisions about matters such as contraception. This right was established in the landmark case of Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965, which held that the Constitution protects the right to use contraceptives. Therefore, a law that prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons would infringe upon this right and therefore be unconstitutional.\n\nThe other options are not applicable. The statute is not a regulation of interstate commerce, so it cannot be constitutional because it is a regulation of interstate commerce. Similarly, the statute is not a measure promoting the general welfare, so it cannot be constitutional because it is a measure promoting the general welfare.",
