The buccal surfaces of the upper molars and labial surfaces of the lower incisors.\n\nassistant:Dental plaque is most likely to accumulate on the buccal surfaces of the upper molars and labial surfaces of the lower incisors. This is because these surfaces are in contact with the tongue and cheek, providing a rich source of food debris and microorganisms that can colonize and form plaque. The palatal surfaces and lingual surfaces are less likely to accumulate plaque, but plaque can still form on them.",
