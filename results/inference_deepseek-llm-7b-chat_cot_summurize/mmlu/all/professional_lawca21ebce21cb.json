She sued the store for damages. She testified at trial that while sitting on the floor trying to gather the strength to get up, she heard a grocery employee asst. manager say to an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" The grocer's counsel objected on the basis of hearsay to the admissibility of the purported statements of the asst. manager and the other employee.

The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\nassistant:The court will likely decide that the objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay. In this case, the statement was made in the scope of the asst. manager's duties and was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Instead, it was offered to show that the asst. manager was aware of a problem on the floor, which could be relevant to the plaintiff's claim that the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries. Therefore, the court may find that the statement was admissible under the business-records exception to the hearsay rule.",
