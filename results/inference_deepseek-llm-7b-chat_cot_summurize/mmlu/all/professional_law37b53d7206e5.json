Conviction reversed, because the better interpretation is that mens rea is included, and the owner must know his conduct is in violation of the criminal laws.\n\nThe correct answer is B, and here's why:\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in this case is likely to reverse the conviction because the government had to prove that the store owner had the specific intent to commit a crime, which is typically required in specific intent crimes. The statute in question seems to be a specific intent crime as well, which means that the government would need to prove that the store owner had the specific intent to acquire food stamps not authorized by the statute or the regulations.\n\nThe government's interpretation, which only required proving that the store owner knowingly acquired food stamps, may not be sufficient to meet the burden of proof in a specific intent crime. Instead, the government's interpretation would more closely align with general intent crimes, where the actor's intent is not as important as the result of their actions.\n\nHowever, option C is incorrect because the meaning of \"knowingly\" in the statute does not necessarily mean that the actor must know their conduct is illegal. Rather, it is more likely that the government's interpretation, which required the store owner to knowingly acquire food stamps, would be sufficient to meet the burden of proof for a specific intent crime.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, the government's interpretation, which requires the store owner to knowingly acquire food stamps, would be sufficient to meet the burden of proof for a specific intent crime, even if the modern trend of the law is to recognize criminal liability without mens rea or specific criminal intent.",
