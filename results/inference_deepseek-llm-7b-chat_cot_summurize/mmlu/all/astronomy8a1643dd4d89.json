Which one of them has the smallest distance to Jupiter?\n\nA. Callisto\nB. Europa\nC. Ganymede\nD. Io\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first recall the information about the four big moons of Jupiter, Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, and Io. Next, I will calculate the distance between each moon and Jupiter. Finally, I will determine which moon has the smallest distance to Jupiter and provide the answer.\n\nStep 1: Recall information about the four big moons of Jupiter.\n- Callisto: the second-largest moon, with a diameter of about 4,822 km (2,500 miles)\n- Europa: the fourth-largest moon, with a diameter of about 3,100 km (1,928 miles)\n- Ganymede: the largest moon, with a diameter of about 5,268 km (3,272 miles)\n- Io: the innermost moon, with a diameter of about 3,100 km (1,928 miles)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the distance between each moon and Jupiter.\n- Callisto: Distance = (Jupiter's diameter) / (Moon's diameter) = (132,100 km) / (4,822 km) = ~27.07 times\n- Europa: Distance = (Jupiter's diameter) / (Moon's diameter) = (132,100 km) / (3,100 km) = ~42.69 times\n- Ganymede: Distance = (Jupiter's diameter) / (Moon's diameter) = (132,100 km) / (5,268 km) = ~25.05 times\n- Io: Distance = (Jupiter's diameter) / (Moon's diameter) = (132,100 km) / (3,100 km) = ~42.69 times\n\nStep 3: Determine which moon has the smallest distance to Jupiter.\nComparing the calculated distances, Io has the smallest distance to Jupiter, with a distance of 42.69 times its diameter.\n\nAnswer: D.
