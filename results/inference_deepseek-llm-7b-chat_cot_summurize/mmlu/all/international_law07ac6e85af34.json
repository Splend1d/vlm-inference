The contiguous zone functions as security zone of the coastal State\nB. The contiguous zone is a zone, in which the coastal State may explore and exploit its mineral resources\nC. The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal State is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws\nD. The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal State safeguards its archaeological and historical objects\n\nassistant:The contiguous zone is a specific geographical area surrounding a coastal state, which extends outward from the baseline (the line that defines the outer limit of the territorial sea) for a certain distance, usually up to 12 nautical miles. The primary function of the contiguous zone is to serve as a buffer zone between the territorial sea and the international space beyond.\n\nOption A is partially correct - the contiguous zone does function as a security zone for the coastal state, but it is not the primary purpose of the zone.\n\nOption B is incorrect, as the primary function of the contiguous zone is not related to the exploration or exploitation of natural resources.\n\nOption C is also partially correct - the contiguous zone does allow the coastal state to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws within the zone.\n\nOption D is incorrect, as the primary function of the contiguous zone is not related to the safeguarding of archaeological or historical objects.\n\nIn summary, the main function of the contiguous zone is to provide a buffer zone for the coastal state, allowing the state to regulate and enforce laws within the zone, and to safeguard against potential security threats from outside sources.",
