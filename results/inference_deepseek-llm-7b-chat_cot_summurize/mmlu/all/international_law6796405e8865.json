Fragmentation of international law concerns the possibility of different legal regimes apply the same rules of international law\nB. It is possible for several legal regimes (ie foreign investment law and human rights law) to exist and develop in isolation of each other, ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law\nC. Fragmentation is when States assume different interpretations of the same rule of international law\nD. Fragmentation is when States disagree to abide by a certain rule of international law\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Fragmentation of international law refers to the situation where several legal regimes, such as foreign investment law and human rights law, exist and develop in isolation of each other, ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law. This can occur when different international organizations, states, or groups have different interpretations of the same rule of international law, leading to confusion and uncertainty about the application of those rules. Fragmentation can also occur when states or international organizations fail to agree on the proper interpretation or application of a particular rule of international law.",
