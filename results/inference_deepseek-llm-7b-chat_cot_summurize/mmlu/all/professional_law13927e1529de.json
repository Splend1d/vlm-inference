This would show that his actions were motivated by a desire to protect and preserve wetlands, which can have many ecological benefits. It would also suggest that the environmentalist's actions were not intended to cause harm or annoyance to his neighbors, but were instead in line with his commitment to environmental conservation.\n\nOption B is not a valid defense because simply stating that the environmentalist's actions did not violate any zoning ordinances would not necessarily absolve him of any nuisance claims made by the investor.\n\nOption C is not applicable in this situation, as the investor does own the property and has rented it out to a tenant family.\n\nOption D would not be a strong defense either, as the investor's knowledge of the swampy condition of the property at the time of purchase would not necessarily protect the environmentalist from a nuisance claim.",
