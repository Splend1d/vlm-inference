Calculate the present value of the future cash inflows:\n- Year 1: $3,000 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = $2,631.58\n- Year 2: $3,000 / (1 + 0.10)^2 = $2,367.87\n- Year 3: $3,000 / (1 + 0.10)^3 = $2,113.27\n- Year 4: $3,000 / (1 + 0.10)^4 = $1,867.67\n- Year 5: $3,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $1,632.16\n\nTotal present value of cash inflows: $12,768.16\n\n2. Subtract the initial investment:\nNet present value: $12,768.16 - $11,000 = $1,768.16\n\nThe net present value is $1,768.16, which is closest to option C, $4,000.",
