This matches option B, so lysosomes are a potential answer.\n\nAnimal cells do not have large vacuoles that store water, so option C is incorrect.\n\nAnimal cells do have centrioles within centrosomes, which are essential for the organization of microtubule structures during cell division. This matches option D, so centrioles within centrosomes is a potential answer.\n\nComparing the two potential answers, lysosomes and centrioles within centrosomes, both are present in animal cells but not in plant cells. Therefore, the correct answer is the combination of options B and D:\n\nanimal cells have lysosomes and centrioles within centrosomes.",
