You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: What is the pH of a solution made by dissolving 0.0300 mol of sodium ethanoate in enough water to make 50 mL of solution (Ka for ethanoic acid is 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5)?\n\nA. 7\nB. 9.26\nC. 4.74\nD. 11.02\n\nassistant:To determine the pH of the solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of a weak acid/base solution to the acid's dissociation constant (Ka) and the equilibrium constant (Kb) for the conjugate base. In this case, the weak acid is ethanoic acid (C2H4O2), and the conjugate base is sodium ethanoate (C2H4O2-).\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is given by:\n\npH = pKb + log([A-] / [HA])\n\nwhere pH is the desired value, pKb is the pKa value of the conjugate base (Ka for ethanoic acid), [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the equilibrium constant (Kb) for the conjugate base. The equation for the ionization of ethanoic acid is:\n\nC2H4O2(aq) \u2192 C2H4O2^-(aq) + H^+(aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka. We are given the value of Ka, which is 1.8 x 10^-5.\n\nNext, we need to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base. Since we have a 0.0300 moles of ethanoic acid (HA) and it completely dissociates, we can assume that the concentration of the conjugate base is equal to the concentration of the weak acid. Therefore, [A-] = [HA].\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKb + log([HA] / [HA])\npH = pKb + log(0.0300 mol/L)\n\nWe can now calculate the pKb value:\n\npKb = log(pH) - log(0.0300 mol/L)\npKb = log(7.00) - log(0.0300 mol/L)\npKb \u2248 2.16\n\nNow we can find the pH of the solution:\n\npH = pKb + log([HA] / [HA])\npH = 2.16 + log(0.0300 mol/L)\npH \u2248 4.74\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 4.74, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
