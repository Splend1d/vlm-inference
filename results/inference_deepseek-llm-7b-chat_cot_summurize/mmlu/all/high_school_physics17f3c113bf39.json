If the disk only rotates, find the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk in 4.0 s.\n\nA. 0.4 m\nB. 0.8 m\nC. 1.2 m\nD. 1.6 m\n\nassistant:To find the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\ndistance = initial_radius * angular_velocity * time + (1/2) * angular_acceleration * angular_velocity * time^2\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angular acceleration from rad/s^2 to rad/s. Since 1 rad/s = 2\u03c0/60 rad/s^2, we have:\n\nangular_acceleration = 2.0 rad/s^2 * 2\u03c0/60 = 1.376 rad/s\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for the initial conditions:\n\ninitial_radius = 0.1 m = 0.1 * 100 = 10 cm\nangular_velocity = 0 rad/s (since the disk only rotates)\ntime = 4.0 s\n\ndistance = 10 * 0 * 4 + (1/2) * 1.376 * 0 * 4^2\ndistance = 0 + 0\ndistance = 0 m\n\nThe answer is A. 0.4 m.",
