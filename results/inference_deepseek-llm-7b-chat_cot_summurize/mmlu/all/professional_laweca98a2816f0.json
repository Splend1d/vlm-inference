The baseball player's conduct of attacking the umpire with a bat was extreme and outrageous, as it was not justified by any provocation or defense. The player's reaction to the taunting was excessive and unreasonable, and his actions caused the umpire to suffer severe emotional distress, which led to the spectator's emotional trauma. Therefore, if the spectator asserts an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the baseball player, he is likely to win the case.",
