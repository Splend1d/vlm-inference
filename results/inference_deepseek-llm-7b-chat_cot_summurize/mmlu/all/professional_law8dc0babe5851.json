Thereafter, the land-development company developed an exclusive shopping center on 25 acres of the retained land. In February 2001, the land-development company sold the remaining eight residential lots in the eastern tract and the western tract. The next month, the land-development company executed the following instrument to the country club:\"The land-development company, for itself, its successors, and assigns, does hereby release,surrender and quitclaim all rights, title, or other property interest in that certain acres owned by the country club. \"At the time this instrument was executed, the country club had built a club house, golf course, and tennis courts on a portion of its land, and it had 25 acres of vacant land remaining. The country club wishes to commence construction of a new high- rise complex (containing a hotel, shopping mall, apartments, etc. ) on the 25 acres of vacant land it possesses. In an action by one of the homeowners in the western tract to enjoin construction of the complex, plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the homeowner (or any other landowner in the eastern tract or the western tract) as assignee of the land development company could re-enter the land upon breach of condition subsequent.\nB. succeed, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex would constitute a non-conforming use.\nC. not succeed, because the land development company's instrument of March 2001 effectuated an abrogation of the deed restrictions on the country club's use of its property.\nD. not succeed, because in accordance with deed restriction (b), only a homeowner in the eastern tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan.\n\nassistant:A. succeed, because the homeowner (or any other landowner in the eastern tract or the western tract) as assignee of the land development company could re-enter the land upon breach of condition subsequent.\n\nExplanation: The deed restrictions on the country club's land were conditioned on the club maintaining the restrictions on the use of the property. If the club breaches these restrictions, the land-development company or its assignees (e.g., the homeowners in the eastern tract and western tract) can re-enter the land and terminate the estate conveyed. Therefore, the homeowner in the western tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan, as they could potentially re-enter the land and terminate the country club's use of it.\n\nB. not succeed, because a common development scheme had not been established for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex would not constitute a non-conforming use.\n\nExplanation: A common development scheme must have been established for the entire 400-acre tract for it to be considered non-conforming. However, the eastern tract and western tract were developed separately, and no common development scheme was present. Additionally, a non-conforming use refers to a use that is in compliance with the current land use regulations but was not in compliance when the land was first developed. The country club's proposed high-rise complex would not be considered a non-conforming use, as it is not in compliance with the current land use regulations.\n\nC. not succeed, because the land development company's instrument of March 2001 effectuated an abrogation of the deed restrictions on the country club's use of its property.\n\nExplanation: The land development company's instrument of March 2001 did not abrogate the deed restrictions on the country club's use of its property. Instead, it released and quitclaimed the rights of the land development company and its successors and assigns to the property. This does not affect the deed restrictions on the country club's property.\n\nD. not succeed, because in accordance with deed restriction (b), only a homeowner in the eastern tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan.\n\nExplanation: Deed restriction (b) allows the land development company or its successors and assigns to re-enter the country club's property upon breach of the deed restrictions. However, it does not provide standing for a homeowner in the western tract to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan. Therefore, the homeowner in the western tract would not have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan.",
