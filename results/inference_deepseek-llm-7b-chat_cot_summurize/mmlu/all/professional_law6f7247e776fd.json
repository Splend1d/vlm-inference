In one such story, which appeared in a newspaper, an unidentified Cabinet member was quoted as saying that the President pardoned the owner of a professional baseball team, for a previous felony conviction because the owner promised to give the President a lifetime pass to all future games. Upset by these news \"leaks,\" the President, in his last official act, issued an executive order banning all executive employees from having conversations with members of the press unless prior permission had been obtained from an administrative supervisor. The executive order called for the dismissal of any employee willfully in violation of that order. After the President left office, the press made repeated references to the executive order and derisively referred to it as the President's legacy. Nonetheless, after the new President took office he promised to abide by the order.

The order also calls for the dismissal of any employee willfully in violation of that order.\n\nOption A suggests that the order is constitutional because governmental employment is a privilege and not a right. However, this argument is not supported by the text provided, which only states that the President issued the order in his last official act.\n\nOption B suggests that the order is constitutional because the President has plenary power to set forth employment regulations for executive department employees. While the President may have some power to regulate employment, this option does not provide a sufficient basis for upholding the constitutionality of the order.\n\nOption C suggests that the order is unconstitutional because Congress, not the President, has authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment. This argument is supported by the text provided, which states that the President issued the order in his last official act and that the order was in compliance with civil service regulations.\n\nOption D suggests that the order is unconstitutional because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association. While this may be true, the text provided does not provide sufficient information to support this argument.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the text, the most appropriate answer is C. The order is unconstitutional because Congress, not the President, has authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment.",
