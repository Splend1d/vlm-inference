Congress now imposes a tax of 14 cents on each set of tackle sold in the United States. This tax is\n\nA. unconstitutional, because the tackle is sold in interstate commerce.\nB. unconstitutional, because it interferes with the sovereign right of state governments to engage in intrastate commerce.\nC. constitutional, because the supremacy clause validates laws enacted by Congress.\nD. constitutional, because it is within the power of Congress to raise revenue.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. constitutional, because it is within the power of Congress to raise revenue.\n\nThe Taxing Clause of the United States Constitution gives Congress the power to lay and collect taxes \"necessary and proper\" for carrying out its other enumerated powers. In this case, the tax on fish tackle falls under the power of Congress to raise revenue, which is a necessary and proper function of the federal government.\n\nA. This answer is incorrect because the Taxing Clause does not depend on the type of commerce being conducted (interstate or intrastate).\n\nB. This answer is incorrect because the Taxing Clause does not depend on the location of the commerce (interstate or intrastate).\n\nC. This answer is incorrect because the supremacy clause does not determine whether a law is constitutional or not. Rather, it establishes the hierarchy of federal and state powers.",
