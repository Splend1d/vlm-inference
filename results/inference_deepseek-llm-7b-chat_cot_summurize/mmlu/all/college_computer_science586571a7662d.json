II and III only\n\nassistant:To determine which statement must be true for a procedure that terminates, let's consider each option:\n\nI. P has a local variable.\nA procedure that terminates must have a local variable to store information during its execution. This is necessary for the procedure to complete its task and terminate.\n\nII. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.\nA procedure that terminates must have an execution path where it does not call itself. This is because the procedure must complete its task and terminate before it can continue to call itself.\n\nIII. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.\nA procedure that terminates does not necessarily need to refer to a global variable or have at least one parameter. It could call itself without any parameters or reference to global variables.\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true for a procedure that terminates are I (P has a local variable) and II (P has an execution path where it does not call itself).\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.
