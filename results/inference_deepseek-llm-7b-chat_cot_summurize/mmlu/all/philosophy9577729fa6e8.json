This concept is based on the idea that mental states can be understood in terms of their causal role in producing behavior. It is different from logical nominalism, which rejects the idea that mental states have any real existence, and from methodological behaviorism, which is a method for studying behavior but does not necessarily involve the idea that mental states are dispositions to behave in certain ways. Eliminative materialism is not related to this concept.",
