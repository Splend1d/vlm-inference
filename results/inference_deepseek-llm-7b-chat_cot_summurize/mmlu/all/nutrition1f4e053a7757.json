The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern. is the FALSE statement.\n\nWhen dietary fat is introduced into the duodenum, it does not lead to a reduction in motility but rather stimulates it. This process is known as the \"lipid-stimulated motility\". The \"fasting\" to \"feeding\" pattern is not related to the arrival of lipid in the duodenum but rather to the presence of nutrients in the gut.",
