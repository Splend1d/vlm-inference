He argues that man is the most fortunate of all creatures and worthy of admiration because he is allowed to be whatever he chooses to be. He also does not seem to reject the notion that humans are God's equals, as he refers to God's great generosity in allowing man to be whatever he chooses to be.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage, Pico della Mirandola rejected the notion that man was a unique kind of creature (option A). He did not explicitly state that he rejected the idea that humans are God's equals (option D), but he did argue that man is the most fortunate of all creatures and worthy of admiration.\n\nSo, the answer is that Pico della Mirandola rejected the notion that man was a unique kind of creature (option A) and the passage does not provide enough information to determine whether he rejected the notion that humans are God's equals (option D).",
