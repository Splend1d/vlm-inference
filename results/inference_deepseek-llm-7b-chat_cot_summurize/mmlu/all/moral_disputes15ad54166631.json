This scientist's action, in this case, is to find a cure for blindness, which is generally considered a positive thing. However, the scientist's motivation, which is a bad desire for mastery, is seen as negative.\n\nGiven this, the question asks whether sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire. Option A states this idea, suggesting that sometimes even actions with negative motivations can be acceptable if the action itself is positive.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, suggests that all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible. However, the passage does not provide enough information to support this claim.\n\nOption C states that the desire for mastery is not, as Sandel argues, a bad desire. The passage does not mention Sandel or his argument, so this option is not relevant to the discussion.\n\nOption D suggests that sometimes the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires. This option is also not directly supported by the passage, as it does not provide enough information about the motivations of the scientist or other scientists working on finding a cure for the disease.\n\nTherefore, the best answer to the question is option A: sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.",
