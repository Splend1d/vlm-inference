This could include people, animals, and other living beings. So, the statement \"if a person or thing needs to be taken into account in moral decision-making, then that person or thing has moral standing\" is correct.\n\nB. moral permissibility is not the correct answer because it refers to whether a particular action is morally right or wrong, rather than the consideration of a person or thing in moral decision-making.\n\nC. viability is not the correct answer because it refers to the ability to survive or function, which is not related to moral decision-making.\n\nD. All of the above is not the correct answer because only moral standing is the correct answer.",
