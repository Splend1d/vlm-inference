This genetic evidence suggests that the Inuit are related to other Arctic peoples such as the Inuvialuit, who share a common ancestry with the Thule people. This relationship is supported by linguistic and cultural similarities as well. The Thule people were a group of Inuit hunters and fishermen who lived in the Arctic region around 2,500 years ago. Their descendants are the modern Inuit people.",
