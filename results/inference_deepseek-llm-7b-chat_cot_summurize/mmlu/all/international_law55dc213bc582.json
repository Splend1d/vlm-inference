In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory\nD. The ICJ has never addressed this issue\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The concept of an armed attack refers to a single attack, not multiple smaller instances of armed force.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the main judicial organ of the United Nations. Its role is to provide an advisory opinion on legal questions referred to it by the United Nations Security Council or by any of the Member States.\n\nIn the case of Nicaragua v. United States (1986), the ICJ was asked to rule on whether the use of the Contras, a group opposed to the Nicaraguan government, constituted an armed attack on Nicaragua. The ICJ ruled that the use of the Contras did not constitute an armed attack, as the Contras did not engage in a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force. Instead, the Contras engaged in a series of sporadic attacks, but these did not constitute a continuous or systematic attack.\n\nTherefore, the ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory, and the concept of an armed attack refers to a single attack, not multiple smaller instances of armed force.",
