The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa\nD. The importation of New World products into Africa\n\nassistant:The task at hand is to identify which development of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. is most likely the subject of Walter Rodney's argument in the passage. The passage discusses the responsibility of the imperialist system for African underdevelopment, with Western European capitalists being identified as the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\n\nOption A, The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers, is a potential answer. This development could have led to the draining of African wealth and the exploitation of resources, as described by Rodney.\n\nOption B, The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World, is not directly related to the argument about African underdevelopment and imperialist exploitation.\n\nOption C, The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa, is also not directly related to the argument about African underdevelopment and imperialist exploitation.\n\nOption D, The importation of New World products into Africa, may have contributed to African underdevelopment by displacing local industries and economies, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage and the context of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E., it is most likely that Rodney's argument is a response to the colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
