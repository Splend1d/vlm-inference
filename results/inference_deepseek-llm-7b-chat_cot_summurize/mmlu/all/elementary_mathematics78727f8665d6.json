She spent equal amounts of time on all subjects. If Keri spent 1 over 2 hour on science, how many subjects did she study?\n\nA. 4 subjects\nB. 2 subjects\nC. 6 subjects\nD. 5 subjects\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Keri spent on all subjects. We know that she spent 3 hours on her homework and that she spent equal amounts of time on all subjects. We also know that she spent 1/2 hours on science.\n\nLet's assume that she spent x hours on each subject. Since she spent equal amounts of time on all subjects, we can say that the total time spent on all subjects is 3 hours, which is equal to x * 2 (since she spent x hours on each subject).\n\nNow, we can set up an equation:\n\nx * 2 = 3\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = 3 / 2\nx = 1.5\n\nSince Keri spent 1/2 hours on science, she spent 1.5 hours on each of the remaining subjects. Therefore, she studied 2 subjects (English, Math, and Science).\n\nSo the answer is B. 2 subjects.",
