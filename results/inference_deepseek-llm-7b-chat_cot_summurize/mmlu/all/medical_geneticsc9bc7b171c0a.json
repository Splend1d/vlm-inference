A Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal abnormality that occurs when the long arms of two chromosomes with the same arm length exchange segments of their short arms. The centromeres, which are the regions of the chromosomes responsible for attaching to the spindle fibers during cell division, are involved in the fusion process. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. telomeres: These are the protective sequences at the ends of chromosomes that help prevent chromosomal damage during replication.\nC. histones: These are the proteins that wrap around DNA in the chromosomes and help organize them.\nD. ends of the long arms: While the long arms of the chromosomes do contribute to the fusion process, the specific location of the fusion is at the centromeres.",
