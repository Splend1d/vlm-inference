The incidents of careless driving during the past six months provide evidence of the woman's driving behavior and may be used to show that she was negligent in this particular accident. However, it is not clear why the other driver is charging the neighbor with negligent entrustment of an automobile, as the woman was the one who was driving the neighbor's car in this case.",
