You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. How many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements?\n\nA. 24\nB. 25\nC. 28\nD. 35\n\nassistant:Let's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. Let the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements be F.\n2. Let the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements be G.\n3. According to the given property, F = G + 14.\n4. The total number of subsets of X is 2^n, where n is the number of elements in X.\n5. The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements is 2^n - F - G.\n\nNow, let's replace F and G with the property equation:\n\n2^n - (G + 14) - G\n\nSince we don't know the value of n, we can't find the exact value of F and G. However, we can find the range of possible values for the answer choices.\n\nLet's find the range for F:\n\n2^n - (G + 14) - G\n\nSince F is the number of subsets with 3 elements, we have:\n\n2^n - (G + 14) - G >= 14\n\nNow let's find the range for G:\n\n2^n - G - (G + 14) >= 14\n\nSolving for G:\n\n2^n - G - G - 14 >= 14\n2^n - 2G - 14 >= 14\n2^n - 14 >= 2G\n\nSince G must be an integer, the largest possible value for G is 7 (2^3 - 14 >= 2G). This means the largest possible value for F is 13 (2^n - (G + 14) - G >= 14 when n = 3, G = 7).\n\nNow let's find the range for G:\n\n2^n - G - (G + 14) >= 14\n\nSince G must be an integer, the smallest possible value for G is 6 (2^2 - 14 >= 2G when n = 2, G = 6). This means the smallest possible value for F is 10 (2^n - (G + 14) - G >= 14 when n = 2, G = 6).\n\nNow, let's find the range for the number of subsets with 4 elements:\n\n2^n - (G + 14) - G\n\nSince we know the range for G, we can find the range for F:\n\n2^n - (G + 14) - G >= 14\n\n2^n - 14 >= 2G\n\n2^n >= 2G + 14\n\n2^n >= 2(G + 7)\n\nNow let's find the range for the number of subsets with 4 elements:\n\n2^n - (G + 14) - G >= 14\n\n2^n - 14 >= 2G\n\n2^n >= 2G + 14\n\n2^n >= 2(G + 7)\n\nSince G must be an integer, the smallest possible value for G is 6 (G + 7 >= 2^n when n = 2). This means the smallest possible value for F is 10 (2^n - (G + 14) - G >= 14 when n = 2, G = 6).\n\nThe smallest possible value for the number of subsets with 4 elements is:\n\n2^2 - (6 + 14) - 6 = 32 - 20 - 6 = 6\n\nThe largest possible value for the number of subsets with 4 elements is:\n\n2^n - (G + 14) - G\n2^n - (6 + 14) - 6\n\nThe largest possible value for G is 7 (2^3 - 14 >= 2G when n = 3). This means the largest possible value for F is 13 (2^n - (G + 14) - G >= 14 when n = 3, G = 7).\n\nThe largest possible value for the number of subsets with 4 elements is:\n\n2^3 - (7 + 14) - 6 = 8 - 21 - 6 = 0\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nA. 24",
