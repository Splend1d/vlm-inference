An association of medical doctors that alleges that the legalization of marijuana will result in a public health hazard.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. A nonprofit organization of war veterans that claims it can demonstrate a greater need for the funds than can the museum.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not have the standing to challenge the appropriation of the tax monies to the art museum. A state other than the one in which the museum is located does not have the authority to challenge the appropriation of funds. A purchaser of marijuana cigarettes does not have the standing to challenge the appropriation because they are required to pay the tax, not the museum. An association of medical doctors does not have the standing to challenge the appropriation because their concern about public health is not directly related to the appropriation of the tax monies to the museum.",
