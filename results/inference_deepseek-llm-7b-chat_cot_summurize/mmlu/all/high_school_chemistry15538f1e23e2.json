How many moles of oxygen gas will form when 4.32 g of solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes? The formula mass of mercury(II) oxide is 216 g mol^-1.\n\nA. 0.100 mol\nB. 0.0100 mol\nC. 0.0200 mol\nD. 0.0150 mol\n\nassistant:To determine the number of moles of oxygen gas that will form when 4.32 g of solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes, we can use the balanced equation:\n\nHgO(s) \u2192 Hg(l) + 1/2 O2(g)\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of oxygen gas, O2. The formula mass of oxygen is 32 g mol^-1.\n\nNow, we can use the molar mass of mercury(II) oxide (HgO) to find the molar mass of oxygen gas (O2) that would be produced when 1 mole of mercury(II) oxide decomposes.\n\nThe molar mass of HgO is 216 g mol^-1. Since 1 mole of HgO will decompose into 1/2 mole of O2, we can find the molar mass of O2:\n\nMolar mass of O2 = (1/2) \\* molar mass of HgO\nMolar mass of O2 = (1/2) \\* 216 g mol^-1\nMolar mass of O2 = 108 g mol^-1\n\nNow that we know the molar mass of oxygen gas, we can determine how many moles of oxygen gas will form when 4.32 g of solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes:\n\n4.32 g of HgO \ufffd 108 g mol^-1 of O2 = 0.04 mol O2\n\nTherefore, 0.04 mol of oxygen gas will form when 4.32 g of solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes. This corresponds to answer choice C.",
