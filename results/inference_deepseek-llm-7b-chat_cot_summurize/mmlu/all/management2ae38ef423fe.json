These studies were notable for their focus on the relationship between worker motivation and productivity, and they are often cited as a turning point in the study of human behavior in the workplace. While the other options listed (Mary Parker Follett, Lillian Gilbreth, and Frederick Taylor) are important figures in the history of management and industrial psychology, they are not directly associated with the Hawthorn Studies.",
