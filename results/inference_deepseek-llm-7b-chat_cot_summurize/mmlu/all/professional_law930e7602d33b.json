At trial, the defendant testified that she prophesied the victim's imminent death. The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\nC. Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.\nD. A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.\n\nassistant:The defendant's best basis for securing a new trial would be if there was a juror who had been influenced by outside information or personal bias that affected their decision. In option B, a juror violated the court's instructions and read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes. This could potentially affect the juror's impartiality and judgement. Therefore, an affidavit containing this fact would most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial.\n\nOption A is not as strong because the juror's misunderstanding of the burden of proof does not necessarily mean their decision was affected by outside information or personal bias. Option C is also not as strong because the juror falling asleep during defense counsel's closing argument does not necessarily mean their decision was affected by outside information or personal bias. Finally, option D is not as strong because the juror admitting to personal animosity towards the defendant does not necessarily mean their decision was affected by outside information or personal bias.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.",
