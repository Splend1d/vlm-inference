Each student will receive a piece of rope that is 5 feet 8 inches long. What is the total length of rope Ms. Gutierrez needs to order for her class?\n\nA. 106 feet 8 inches\nB. 154 feet 8 inches\nC. 160 feet 8 inches\nD. 181 feet 4 inches\n\nassistant:To find the total length of rope Ms. Gutierrez needs to order, we can first convert the height of each student's rope to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can divide the height of each student's rope by 12. Then, we can sum up the lengths of all the ropes to find the total length.\n\nEach student's rope is 5 feet 8 inches long. To convert this to feet, we divide 8 inches by 12:\n\n5 feet + (8/12) feet = 5.67 feet\n\nThere are 32 students in Ms. Gutierrez's class, so we multiply the length of each student's rope by 32:\n\n32 ropes * 5.67 feet/rope = 179.84 feet\n\nNext, we can add the height of each student's rope to find the total length of rope needed:\n\n179.84 feet + (8/12) feet = 179.84 feet + 0.67 feet = 180.51 feet\n\nThe closest answer to this total length is 181 feet 4 inches, so the answer is D. 181 feet 4 inches.",
