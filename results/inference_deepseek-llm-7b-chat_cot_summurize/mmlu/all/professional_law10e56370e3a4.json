As a result, Congress enacted a statute that limited recovery in personal injury actions filed in state court(s) to $400,000, and punitive action recovery to a maximum of $750,000.

In this case, the statute limiting damage awards in personal injury actions is a federal law that conflicts with state law. Therefore, the federal law takes precedence over the state law, and the statute should be considered constitutional.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the statute does not involve interstate commerce, and Congress can enact legislation on local matters if it is necessary to protect the federal interest.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the situation presented here. The clause applies when there is discrimination against individuals based on their protected characteristics, such as race, gender, or religion. In this case, there is no discrimination involved, and the issue is about the amount of damage awards in personal injury actions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Article III of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate the jurisdiction and scope of judicial review of federal and lower state courts. However, this does not provide Congress with the authority to limit the amount of damage awards in personal injury actions.",
