How does he suggest this aspect of equality to be measured?\n\nA. When no-one would prefer another's bundle of resources to his or her own.\nB. By reference to the ownership of private property.\nC. By the amount of income tax paid by individuals.\nD. When the community determines that equality has been achieved.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first need to understand the context and the key points of Dworkin's argument. Dworkin is discussing the ideal of equality of welfare and how it can be measured. After analyzing the information, I can determine the correct answer.\n\nThe ideal of equality of welfare is to ensure that everyone has an equal quality of life. Dworkin suggests that this can be achieved by measuring equality of resources. When no one would prefer another's bundle of resources to their own, it means that everyone has an equal amount of resources and can lead a similar quality of life.\n\nComparing the options provided:\n\nA. When no-one would prefer another's bundle of resources to his or her own.\nB. By reference to the ownership of private property.\nC. By the amount of income tax paid by individuals.\nD. When the community determines that equality has been achieved.\n\nOption A seems to align with Dworkin's argument as it focuses on the equality of resources, which is the key aspect of his conception of equality of welfare.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. When no-one would prefer another's bundle of resources to his or her own.",
