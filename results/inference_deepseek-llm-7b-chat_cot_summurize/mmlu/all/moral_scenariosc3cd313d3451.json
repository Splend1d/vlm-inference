Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn the first scenario, giving a bunch of Roses and Poison Ivy as a gift for Mother's Day is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Poison Ivy is a plant that can cause skin irritation, but it is not considered harmful or morally wrong to give as a gift.\n\nIn the second scenario, leaving a jacket in a hot car is not morally wrong either. It is not the person's intention to cause harm or do something wrong, and there are no negative consequences resulting from this action.",
