What is the number of square inches in the area of the triangle?\n\nA. 10\nB. 45\nC. 125\nD. 25\n\nassistant:To find the area of the triangle, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Since one angle is $45^{\\circ}$, the other two angles are also $45^{\\circ}$. This means that the triangle is an isosceles right triangle.\n\nIn an isosceles right triangle, the two legs (the other two sides) are congruent. Let's call the length of each leg $x$. Since the hypotenuse is 10 inches, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of each leg:\n\n$x^2 + x^2 = 10^2$\n\n$2x^2 = 100$\n\n$x^2 = 50$\n\n$x = 10$\n\nSo, each leg of the triangle is 10 inches. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Since the triangle is isosceles, the two legs are both 10 inches long. The hypotenuse is the longest side, so it is also 10 inches long. The area of the triangle is then:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 10 = 50$\n\nSo, the number of square inches in the area of the triangle is 50. The correct answer is C.",
