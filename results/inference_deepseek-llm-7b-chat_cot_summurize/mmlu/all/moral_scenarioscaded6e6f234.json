Based on the information provided, it is not clear which scenario involves the main character doing something morally wrong. In the first scenario, offering a shower to a student may be inappropriate, but it may not necessarily be morally wrong. In the second scenario, leaving the plug on a respirator can be considered unsafe and potentially harmful, but it may not necessarily be morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
