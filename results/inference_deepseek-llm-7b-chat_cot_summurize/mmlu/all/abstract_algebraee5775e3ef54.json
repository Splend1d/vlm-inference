Statement 2 | Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to analyze the two statements and check if they are true or false.\n\nStatement 1: Every permutation is a one-to-one function.\n\nA permutation is a function that rearranges the elements of a set. A one-to-one function is a function that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain. Since a permutation always rearranges the elements of a set, it must map distinct elements of the domain to distinct elements of the codomain. Therefore, every permutation is a one-to-one function.\n\nStatement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\n\nThis statement is not true. A function can be many things other than a permutation. For example, a function that maps integers to integers but does not preserve the order (i.e., it is not a permutation) can still exist. Therefore, there are functions that are not permutations, and this statement is not true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. False, False",
