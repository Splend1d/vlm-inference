Long chain (=20 carbons) saturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nStudies have shown that a balance of saturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma phospholipids is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. The presence of these fatty acids in plasma phospholipids helps to maintain healthy cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart disease and stroke.",
