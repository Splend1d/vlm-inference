Black hair coat is dominant over white hair coat. Three quarters of the offspring have black coats, and one quarter have white coats. The genotypes of the parents were most likely\n\nA. bb \u00d7 bb\nB. Bb \u00d7 Bb\nC. Bb \u00d7 bb\nD. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nassistant:To determine the genotypes of the parents, we can use the information about the offspring to make a genetic cross.\n\nWe know that three quarters of the offspring have black coats (BB) and one quarter have white coats (Bb). This means that the ratio of BB:Bb:Bb:BB is 3:1:1:3.\n\nLet's assume that the genotypes of the parents are Bb and Bb. This means that the parents are heterozygous for the dominant black hair coat gene (Bb).\n\nSince the offspring are all heterozygous for the black hair coat gene (BB), the genotypes of the parents must be different from the genotypes of the offspring. This means that the parents cannot both be heterozygous for the black hair coat gene (Bb).\n\nTherefore, the genotypes of the parents were most likely D. BB \u00d7 Bb.",
