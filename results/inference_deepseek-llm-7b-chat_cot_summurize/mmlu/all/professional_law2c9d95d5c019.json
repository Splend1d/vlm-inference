This clause protects citizens from state-imposed discrimination based on their citizenship status.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while the state's police power is indeed an important consideration, it is not the determining factor in determining the constitutionality of this policy.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the fee structure is not a reasonable contribution toward the protection that the state government gave nonresidents, but rather a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the policy does not place a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. Rather, it discriminates between in-staters and out-of-staters based on their citizenship status, which is a violation of the privileges and immunities clause.",
