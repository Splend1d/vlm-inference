An important incident in opposing British taxation policy\nB. An early attack on the institution of slavery\nC. A landmark case concerning voting rights\nD. A landmark case concerning freedom of expression\n\nassistant:The Zenger Trial was a landmark case concerning freedom of expression. The trial was a libel case against the newspaper editor, John Peter Zenger, who was accused of seditious libel for printing articles critical of the governor of New York. However, the trial ultimately ended in a victory for Zenger, which established the principle of freedom of the press in America. This was an important victory for the right to express one's opinions freely, and it helped to establish the foundation for the concept of freedom of the press in the United States.\n\nThe trial was significant not only for its impact on the press and freedom of expression, but also because it demonstrated the willingness of the American people to stand up for their rights and liberties. The arguments made by Andrew Hamilton in his closing statement highlighted the importance of protecting the rights of free men to express their opinions, and the potential consequences of suppressing such freedoms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A landmark case concerning freedom of expression.",
