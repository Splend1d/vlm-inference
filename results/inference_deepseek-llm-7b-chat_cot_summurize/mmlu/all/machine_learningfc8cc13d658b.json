Statement 2| Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:A. True, True\n\nStatement 1 is true because ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions are not monotonic. They saturate at zero and increase linearly above zero, which means they can output any value within a certain range, not just positive values. In contrast, sigmoid functions are monotonic, as their output increases continuously and non-linearly as the input increases.\n\nStatement 2 is also true because neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability do converge to the global optimum. This is because gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively moves in the direction of steepest descent, which guarantees convergence to a minimum of the loss function. However, the global optimum depends on the initialization and architecture of the neural network, and it may not always be the global optimum of the loss function.",
