If the hotel brings suit against the senator to recover for the unpaid balance, how many additional days lodging will he be required to pay for?\n\nA. None.\nB. Four.\nC. Seven.\nD. Eleven.\n\nassistant:Let's break down the situation and determine the number of additional days the senator will be required to pay for.\n\n1. From September 1 to September 30, the senator paid $350 per week, covering 4 weeks. So he paid a total of 4 * $350 = $1400.\n2. From October 1 to October 31, the senator paid $350 per week, covering 4 weeks. So he paid a total of 4 * $350 = $1400.\n3. From November 1 to November 3, the senator paid $150, which included tax and other incidental charges.\n\nNow, let's calculate the unpaid charges:\n\n1. From September 1 to September 30, the senator owed $200 (for the rest of the week) + $350 (for the following week) = $550.\n2. From October 1 to October 31, the senator owed $550 (for the rest of the week) + $350 (for the following week) = $900.\n\nNow, let's add up the unpaid charges for both months:\n\n$550 (September) + $900 (October) = $1450\n\nThe senator owed the hotel $1450 for the two months.\n\nThe senator paid $150 for November 1 to November 3. This covers 3 days.\n\nTherefore, the senator is required to pay an additional $1450 / 3 = $483.33 per day.\n\nThe total additional days lodging the senator will be required to pay for is:\n\n$1450 / 483.33 days = 3 days.\n\nSo the answer is C.
