If money demand is perfectly elastic which of the following is likely to occur?\n\nA. Money supply increases by $10 million lowering the interest rate and increasing AD.\nB. Money supply remains constant the interest rate does not fall and AD does not increase.\nC. Money supply increases by $10 million the interest rate does not fall and AD does not increase.\nD. Money supply decreases by $10 million raising the interest rate and decreasing AD.\n\nassistant:If the money demand is perfectly elastic, then the Fed's purchase of $1 million in Treasury securities will lead to an increase in the money supply of $10 million. This is because commercial banks will be required to increase their reserve balances by $1 million, and they will do so by increasing their holdings of reserves. This increase in reserves will lead to an increase in the money supply.\n\nSince the money supply has increased, the interest rate is expected to remain unchanged. This is because an increase in the money supply will not cause an increase in the interest rate when the demand for money is perfectly elastic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Money supply increases by $10 million, the interest rate does not fall, and AD does not increase.",
