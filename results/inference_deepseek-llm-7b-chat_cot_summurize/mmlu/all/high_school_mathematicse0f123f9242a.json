One solution to the equation $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$ is $x=r$. Find the other solution in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$.\n\nA. pqr\nB. pq-r\nC. p-q-r\nD. p+q-r\n\nassistant:We can solve the equation $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$ by expanding both sides:\n$(x-p)(x-q) = (x^2 - (p+q)) = (r-p)(r-q) = r^2 - (p+q)$\n\nNow, we have the equation $x^2 - (p+q) = r^2 - (p+q)$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$x^2 = r^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have:\n$x = \\sqrt{r^2}$\n\nSince $r$ is a constant, we can simplify the expression:\n$x = \\sqrt{r^2} = \\sqrt{r^2}$\n\nTherefore, the other solution is $x = \\sqrt{r}$, so the answer is D. p+q-r.",
