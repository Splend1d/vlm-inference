E. coli STECs and non-STEC subtypes\n\nassistant:The two most common causes of foodborne illness in the United States and Europe are Salmonella and Campylobacter. These bacteria can contaminate food and water sources, and they are responsible for a significant number of illnesses and deaths each year.\n\nSalmonella is a type of bacteria that can contaminate raw and undercooked eggs, poultry, and beef. It can also be found in contaminated water sources. Symptoms of Salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, which typically last for four to seven days.\n\nCampylobacter, on the other hand, is a type of bacteria that can contaminate raw poultry, raw milk, and contaminated water sources. Symptoms of Campylobacter infection include diarrhea, cramping, and fever, which can last for several weeks.\n\nBoth Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are preventable by following proper food handling and preparation practices, such as washing hands and surfaces frequently, cooking meat and poultry thoroughly, and avoiding cross-contamination.",
