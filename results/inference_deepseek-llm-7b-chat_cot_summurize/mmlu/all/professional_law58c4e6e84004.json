The painter promised the homeowner to paint the house for $10,000.\n2. The painter gave the handyman $10,000 to paint the house, agreeing to let the handyman keep the money if he did the job.\n3. The handyman began painting the house, but did not complete the job.\n4. The homeowner did not have a contract with the handyman.\n5. The handyman did not receive any payment for the partial job he did.\n6. The handyman would be unjustly enriched by the homeowner's promise to pay $10,000 and the homeowner's use of the handyman's services.\n7. The homeowner benefited from the handyman's work, while the handyman did not receive any payment for the work.\n8. The handyman can claim unjust enrichment, as he did not receive anything in return for his work, and the homeowner did not have a contract with him.",
