Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\n\nA. 0.13c\nB. 0.15c\nC. 0.36c\nD. 0.53c\n\nassistant:Let's denote the speed of light relative to the stationary observer O as c and the speed of O' as v. We have two cases to consider:\n\n1) If the two sources of light flash simultaneously for O, then the time of the flash for O' is x/v + (10-x)/v = 2x/v, where x is the distance between the two sources.\n\n2) If the first source of light flashes 13 ns before the second source of light for O', then the time of the flash for O' is x/(v-c) - (10-x)/(v-c) = 2x/(v-c).\n\nSince the observers observe the sources to flash simultaneously, we have:\n\n2x/v = 2x/(v-c)\n\nWe can now solve for v:\n\n2v = 2v - 2c\nv = c\n\nNow, let's calculate the speed of O' relative to O:\n\n2x/v = 13 ns\n2x/(c) = 13 ns\nx = 0.0238 m\n\nNow, we have x = 0.0238 m, and we can calculate the speed of O':\n\nv = x/t\nv = 0.0238 m / (13 ns)\nv = 0.18076 ns\n\nFinally, we need to convert v from seconds to light speed:\n\nv = 0.18076 * 10^6 / (299792458)\nv = 0.0000604 c\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 0.53c.",
