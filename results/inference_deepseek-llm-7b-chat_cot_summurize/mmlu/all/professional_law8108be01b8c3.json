Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\nD. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.\n\nassistant:The court would likely hold that the lumber mill should be excused from further performance, and therefore the store should be granted judgment for the mill. This is because the mill's duties of performance would be discharged by impossibility (Option C). The forest fire destroyed the mill's lumber reserve, making it impossible for the mill to fulfill its contract with the store.\n\nThe court would likely find that the mill could not have reasonably foreseen the forest fire and its consequences, and therefore the mill would not be held liable for the breach of contract. Additionally, the court might also find that the store's purpose for the contract (receiving the plywood sheets) was frustrated by the impossibility of the mill's performance.\n\nIn summary, the court would likely hold that the mill should be excused from further performance due to the impossibility of fulfilling the contract, and the store should be granted judgment for the mill.",
