This is the core of option C. \n\nGill's concept of autonomy emphasizes the importance of self-determination, which encompasses the freedom to make choices and act in accordance with one's own values, beliefs, and preferences. This is not limited to simply being free from distress, as option A suggests, nor is it primarily about the ability to choose to end one's own life, as option B implies. \n\nFurthermore, the notion of autonomy does not entail a duty to not interfere with the free choices of others, as option D suggests. Instead, autonomy is a personal right to make decisions for oneself and to be free from external control or interference.\n\nIn summary, the moral value of autonomy, as per Gill's perspective, is best captured by option C: the ability to make important life decisions on the basis of our deepest values.",
