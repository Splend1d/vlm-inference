Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcements are more time intensive.\nB. Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements produce results more quickly.\nC. Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.\nD. Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.\n\nassistant:C. Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.\n\nExplanation:\nA variable ratio reinforcement schedule is a type of reinforcement schedule where the subject is reinforced at unpredictable intervals. Researchers use this type of schedule to study behaviors that are motivated by variable rewards, such as food or other items, rather than fixed rewards like money.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fixed ratio schedules of reinforcements are generally considered to be more time-efficient than variable ratio schedules.\n\nOption B is incorrect because variable ratio schedules of reinforcement do not produce results more quickly than fixed ratio schedules. In fact, variable ratio schedules can take longer to produce results because the reinforcement is unpredictable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are not more resistant to extinction than fixed ratio schedules. In fact, variable ratio schedules can be more susceptible to extinction because the unpredictability of reinforcement can make it harder for the subject to learn the behavior.",
