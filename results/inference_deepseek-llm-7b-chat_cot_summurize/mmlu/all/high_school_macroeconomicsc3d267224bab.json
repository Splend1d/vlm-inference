Nominal GDP falls.\n\nWhen nominal GDP falls, households demand more money as an asset because the purchasing power of money increases. When nominal GDP falls, the value of money increases, making it more attractive as a store of value and a means of payment. This leads to an increase in demand for money, which is reflected in the money demand curve shifting to the right.",
