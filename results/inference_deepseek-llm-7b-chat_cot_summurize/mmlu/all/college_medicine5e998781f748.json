This correlation demonstrates:\n\nA. the value of cultural capital.\nB. a meritocracy. \nC. he value of social capital.\nD. a false association.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. he value of social capital.\n\nThe study shows that students who have a strong social network that overlaps with the alumni networks of the selective colleges are more likely to be admitted. This suggests that the value of social capital, or the ability to leverage one's social connections for personal gain, plays a significant role in gaining admission to these colleges.",
