The \"elastic clause\" refers to the ability of the government to adjust the size of the federal workforce in times of economic expansion or contraction.\n\nA. Change citizenship requirements: This option is not related to the \"elastic clause\" of the Constitution.\nB. Impose workplace safety standards: This option is not directly related to the \"elastic clause.\" Workplace safety standards can be implemented through other constitutional provisions or legislation.\nC. Increase tax rates: This option is not directly related to the \"elastic clause.\" The power to impose taxes is granted to the federal government through the Constitution, but tax rates can be adjusted through legislation and not necessarily through the \"elastic clause.\"\nD. Authorize the treasury to print money: This option is related to the \"elastic clause\" of the Constitution. The \"elastic clause\" allows for adjustments in the size of the federal workforce, which can impact the money supply in the economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Authorize the treasury to print money.",
