What is the probability that three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers?\n\nA. \\frac{125}{2916}\nB. \\frac{5}{16}\nC. \\frac{5}{54}\nD. \\frac{5}{55}\n\nassistant:To find the probability, we first need to find the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so there are 6^6 = 46656 possible outcomes in total.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways we can get three prime numbers and three composite numbers from the six dice.\n\nThere are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, and 5) out of 6 possible dice. So, the number of ways to choose 3 prime numbers from 6 dice is C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20 ways.\n\nSimilarly, there are 3 composite numbers (4, 6, and 8) out of 6 possible dice. So, the number of ways to choose 3 composite numbers from 6 dice is C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20 ways.\n\nTo find the number of ways to arrange these 20 prime number rolls and 20 composite number rolls, we multiply the number of ways for each type of roll: 20! / (3! * 20!) = 1,000,000 ways.\n\nFinally, to find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: 1,000,000 / 46656 = 0.0216.\n\nSo, the probability of getting three prime numbers and the rest showing composite numbers is approximately 0.0216, which is not among the options provided. This indicates that there may be an error in the given options.",
