Prophase I\nB. Metaphase I\nC. Anaphase I\nD. Prophase II\n\nassistant:Crossing-over occurs during the prophase I of meiosis. This is the phase where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, leading to genetic diversity in the offspring.\n\nHere is a brief explanation of the other phases:\nA. Prophase I: The chromosomes begin to condense and pair up, forming the tetrads. The centromeres and telomeres are visible, while the nucleolus disappears.\nB. Metaphase I: The tetrads line up at the middle of the spindle fibers, and the centromeres align with the centromeres of the opposite sister chromatids.\nC. Anaphase I: The spindle fibers contract, pulling sister chromatids apart, resulting in the separation of the chromosomes and the formation of haploid daughter cells.\nD. Prophase II: Occurs in the second meiotic division, and the chromosomes repeat the process of condensing and pairing, but this time, crossing-over occurs between the non-sister chromatids.",
