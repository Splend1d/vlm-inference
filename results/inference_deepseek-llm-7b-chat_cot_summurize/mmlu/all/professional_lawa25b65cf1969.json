It will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. This new federal statute is designed to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights.\n\nTo determine which of the options is most clearly constitutional as applied to the new federal statute, we need to look at each option and analyze its relationship to the statute.\n\nA. The rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business. This option does not involve a leasehold contract between a landlord and a tenant, but rather a rental agreement between two businesses. Therefore, it is not applicable to the new federal statute.\n\nB. The rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six. This option involves a leasehold contract between a landlord and a tenant. The new federal statute is intended to apply to such contracts, and it is designed to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords. Therefore, this option is clearly constitutional as applied to the new federal statute.\n\nC. The rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant. This option involves a leasehold contract between a landlord and a tenant. The new federal statute is intended to apply to such contracts, and it is designed to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords. Therefore, this option is also clearly constitutional as applied to the new federal statute.\n\nD. The rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord. This option involves a leasehold contract between a landlord and a tenant. The new federal statute is intended to apply to such contracts, and it is designed to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords. Therefore, this option is also clearly constitutional as applied to the new federal statute.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, all of them are clearly constitutional as applied to the new federal statute.",
