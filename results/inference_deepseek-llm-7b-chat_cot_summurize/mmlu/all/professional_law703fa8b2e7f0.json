The homeowner entered into the contract with the architect because she was pleased with the work he had done on her neighbor's gardens.

Not relieve the architect of liability, unless there was an express contractual provision against assignments.\n\nIn this situation, the homeowner entered into a contract with the landscape architect for the landscaping of her estate. The architect then assigned the contract to a gardener, who completed 60 percent of the work before the homeowner returned and was dissatisfied. The homeowner then fired the gardener and asserted a claim against the architect for breach of contract.\n\nUnder most contracts, an assignment of the contract to a third party is permitted, as long as the contract specifically states that the contract is not assignable. If the contract states that the contract is assignable, then the architect would not be liable for the gardener's work, as the gardener was fulfilling the obligations of the original contract. However, if there was an express contractual provision against assignments, then the architect would not be relieved of liability for the gardener's work.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the architect assigned the contract to the gardener would not relieve the architect of liability unless there was an express contractual provision against assignments. The other answers are incorrect because they do not take into account the specific provisions of the original contract.",
