This suggests that forgetting may be a matter of\n\nA. displacement\nB. gradual decay\nC. retrieval failure\nD. failure to encode the memories\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. retrieval failure.\n\nWilder Penfield's studies suggest that some long-lost memories can be elicited through electrical stimulation of the brain, which indicates that the memory was present in the brain but was not able to be retrieved or accessed. This is due to retrieval failure, which is the inability to bring a memory to mind. The other options are not supported by the information given in the question. Displacement refers to moving a memory to a new location in the mind, gradual decay refers to the natural loss of memory over time, and failure to encode the memories refers to the initial encoding of the memory being unsuccessful.",
