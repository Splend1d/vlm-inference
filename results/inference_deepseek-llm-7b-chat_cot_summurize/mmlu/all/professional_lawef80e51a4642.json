Yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement.\nD. Yes, because the doctrine of promissory estoppel will prevent the woman from denying her own signed acknowledgment that she received the $10,000.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. No, because the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing.\n\nThe parol evidence rule is a common law rule that generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence (i.e., evidence outside of the written instrument) to explain or contradict the meaning of a written instrument. However, the rule does not apply to events that occur after the formation of the writing. In this case, the woman has already deposited the man's check, and the man's failure to clear the check is a subsequent event. Therefore, the parol evidence rule does not apply to the woman's proposed testimony.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. No, because the parol evidence rule does not operate to exclude evidence to show lack or want of consideration. This answer is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not operate to exclude evidence of any kind, but rather prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence.\n\nC. Yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement. This answer is incorrect because the written instrument does not appear to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement, as the woman has not actually received the $10,000 from the man.\n\nD. Yes, because the doctrine of promissory estoppel will prevent the woman from denying her own signed acknowledgment that she received the $10,000. This answer is incorrect because promissory estoppel is a separate doctrine that may prevent a party from denying their own promise, but it does not apply to the parol evidence rule.",
