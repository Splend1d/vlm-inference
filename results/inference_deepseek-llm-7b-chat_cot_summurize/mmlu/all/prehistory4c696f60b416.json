This is based on both archaeological and genetic evidence.\n\nArchaeologically, the first evidence of dog domestication comes from the Middle East around 15,000 years ago. Genetic studies also suggest that dogs were first domesticated around this time.\n\nIt is worth noting that there is some debate in the scientific community about the exact timing of dog domestication, with some estimates placing it as early as 30,000 years ago. However, the majority of evidence supports a domestication timeline around 15,000 to 10,000 years ago.",
