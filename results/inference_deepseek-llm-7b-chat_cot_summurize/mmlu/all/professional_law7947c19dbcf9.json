On cross- examination of the pedestrian's physician, the defendant's attorney asked him whether or not the pedestrian had told him that the leg that she claimed was injured had been permanently stiff as a result of a former field hockey injury the pedestrian suffered in high school. Upon objection by the pedestrian's attorney, the trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. sustain the objection, as violative of the physician-patient privilege.\nC. overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\nD. overrule the objection, as a statement against interest.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\n\nThe statement made by the defendant's attorney during cross-examination of the pedestrian's physician is a \"statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\" This type of statement is generally considered inadmissible in court as it would be protected by the physician-patient privilege. However, the privilege may be waived if the statement is made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. In this case, the defendant's attorney is attempting to discredit the pedestrian's claim by suggesting that her claim of permanent stiffness in her leg is not consistent with her prior injury. The trial judge should therefore overrule the objection and allow the statement to be used in court.\n\nA is incorrect because the statement made by the pedestrian's physician is not hearsay, as it was not made out of court. B is incorrect because the statement was not made in the course of professional medical advice or treatment, and therefore does not constitute a violation of the physician-patient privilege. D is incorrect because the statement is not against the interest of the patient, but rather is being used for the purpose of contradicting the pedestrian's claim.",
