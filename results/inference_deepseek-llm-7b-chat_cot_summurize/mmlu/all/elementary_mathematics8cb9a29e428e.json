How long would a school year be with the proposed increase?\n\nA. 181 days\nB. 183 days\nC. 185 days\nD. 189 days\n\nassistant:To find the answer, we can multiply the current number of days in a school year (180 days) by 1.05 (which represents the 5% increase).\n\n180 days * 1.05 = 189.0005 days\n\nSince the answer cannot be a fraction, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 189 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 189 days.",
