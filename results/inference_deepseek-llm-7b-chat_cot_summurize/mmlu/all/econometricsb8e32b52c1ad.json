(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) only.\n\nThe VAR approach to modelling the relationship between variables has several advantages over full structural models. First, VARs receive strong motivation from financial and economic theory, making them a useful tool for modeling complex systems. Second, VARs in their reduced forms can be used easily to produce time-series forecasts, making them a valuable tool for predicting future trends. Third, VAR models are typically highly parsimonious, meaning they use a minimal number of variables to explain a given set of data. Finally, OLS can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR, making it a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing complex data sets.",
