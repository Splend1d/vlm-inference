Senate decorum forbids one senator from attempting to stop another's speech\nB. the House meets for substantially fewer hours per day than does the Senate\nC. Senate sessions, unlike House sessions, are open to the public\nD. debate in the House is in most instances strictly regulated by the rules\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Senate decorum forbids one senator from attempting to stop another's speech.\n\nIn the Senate, the filibuster is a procedural delay that allows a single senator to talk continuously for hours, slowing down the progress of legislation. This rule is intended to give minority parties a chance to be heard and to prevent a simple majority from steamrolling over the minority.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, however, the rules are slightly different. While filibustering is possible, it is not as common or as well-known as it is in the Senate. This is because the House has a \"closed rule,\" which means that debate is limited to a specified number of hours for each bill, and once that time has elapsed, the bill must either be voted on or be laid aside.\n\nIn contrast, the Senate has an \"open rule\" that allows debate to continue indefinitely, as long as a senator keeps talking. This allows for more opportunities for filibustering to occur, as a single senator can hold up legislation for an extended period of time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. the House meets for substantially fewer hours per day than does the Senate. While the House does meet for fewer hours, this is not the primary reason why filibustering is less common in the House.",
