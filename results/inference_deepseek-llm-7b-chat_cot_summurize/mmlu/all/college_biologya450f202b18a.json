Prostaglandins\nB. Inositol triphosphate\nC. Cyclic AMP\nD. Calmodulin\n\nassistant:Prostaglandins are a second messenger that stimulates release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. They are a type of lipid mediator that plays a role in inflammation, pain, and other physiological processes. The other options are not second messengers - Inositol triphosphate (IP3) and Cyclic AMP (cAMP) are signaling molecules, while Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein.",
