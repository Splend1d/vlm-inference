Nekton refers to a group of organisms that are free-swimming and do not have appendages for attachment to the substrate (e.g., ocean floor). Whales are mammals that are nektonic, as they are able to swim and travel through the water without any attachment to the seafloor. Barnacles and cyanobacteria are both sessile (attached to a substrate) organisms, while protists can be either free-swimming or attached to a substrate, depending on the species.",
