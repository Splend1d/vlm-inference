The concept of Manifest Destiny was a belief that it was God's will for the United States to expand its territory westward across North America and eventually merge with Mexico and Central America. The text you provided by John L. O'Sullivan, \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" 1839, supports this concept.\n\nThe question asks for the president most closely associated with the concept of Manifest Destiny.
