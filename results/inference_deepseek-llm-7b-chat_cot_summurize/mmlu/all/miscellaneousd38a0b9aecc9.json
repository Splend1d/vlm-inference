Law of Gravitation\n\nassistant:The name of the Newtonian law that states 'An object in motion tends to stay in motion' is the Law of Inertia. This law is part of Sir Isaac Newton's first law of motion, which states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by an external force.",
