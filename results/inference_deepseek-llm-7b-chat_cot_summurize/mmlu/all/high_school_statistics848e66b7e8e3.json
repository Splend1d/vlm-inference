Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\nD. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\n\nassistant:Let p be Pam's score and q be Mary's score. \n\nFrom the information given, we have the following:\n\n1. p + 8 = q\n2. p = 0.56 * t (where t is the total number of people who took the test)\n3. q = 0.64 * t\n\nNow, we can find the value of t by plugging in the value of p from equation 2 into equation 1:\n\np + 8 = 0.56 * t\np = 0.56 * t - 8\n\nNow we can substitute p from equation 3 into this equation:\n\n0.56 * t - 8 = 0.64 * t\n0.1 * t = 8\nt = 80\n\nNow that we have the value of t, we can find the value of p:\n\np = 0.56 * 80 = 44.8\n\nNow we can find the value of q:\n\nq = 0.64 * 80 = 51.2\n\nNow we can evaluate each option:\n\nA. Mary scored eight more points than Pam. This is not true. Mary scored 7 more points than Pam.\nB. Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's. This is true. 51.2 / 44.8 = 1.15, which is 8% higher than 1.\nC. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary. This is not true. The range between Pam's score and Mary's score is 7, not 8.\nD. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam. This is not true. There are only 8 people who scored higher than both Mary and Pam, as they are the ones who scored at the 92nd and 96th percentiles.",
