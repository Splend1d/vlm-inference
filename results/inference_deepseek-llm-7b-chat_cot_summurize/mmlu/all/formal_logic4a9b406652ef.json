We will examine the argument (A \u2228 B) \u2283 C and the given premises C \u2283 ~D / D \u2283 A.\n\nLet's assume A, B, C, D are all true. Then, the premises C \u2283 ~D / D \u2283 A can be rewritten as:\n\nC \u2283 D' / D \u2283 ~C\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion (A \u2228 B) \u2283 C. We have two cases:\n\n1. A is true, B is true, or both are true. In this case, (A \u2228 B) is true, and C is true. So, (A \u2228 B) \u2283 C is true.\n\n2. A is false, B is false, or both are false. In this case, either C is true or C is false. However, since C \u2283 ~D / D \u2283 ~C, C must be false if D is true. Therefore, (A \u2228 B) \u2283 C is false.\n\nSo, the argument (A \u2228 B) \u2283 C is valid when A is true, B is true, or both are true. This is option A.",
