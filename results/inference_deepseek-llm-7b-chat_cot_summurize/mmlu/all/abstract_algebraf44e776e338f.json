Find this factorization.\n\nA. (x \u2212 2)(x + 2)(x \u2212 1)(x + 1)\nB. (x+1)^4\nC. (x-1)(x+1)^3\nD. (x-1)^3(x+1)\n\nassistant:Let's first find the factorization of the given polynomial x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x].\n\nx^4 + 4 can be written as (x^4 + 4) = (x^4 + 1) + 3 (mod 5).\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of x^4 + 1 (mod 5). We can use the following properties of modular arithmetic:\n\n1. (x + 1)^4 (mod 5) = 1 (mod 5)\n2. (x^4 + 1) (mod 5) = (x^4 + 1) (mod 1) = 0 (mod 1)\n\nFrom property 2, we can see that x^4 + 1 is congruent to 0 (mod 1). This means that x^4 + 1 = 0 (mod 1) has a root in Z_5[x].\n\nNow, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the other roots:\n\nx^4 + 1 (mod 5) = 0 (mod 1)\nx^4 + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 1)\nx^4 + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 5)\n\nWe can use the following properties of modular arithmetic:\n\n1. (x + 1)^4 (mod 5) = 1 (mod 5)\n2. (x^4 + 1) (mod 5) = 0 (mod 5)\n\nFrom property 1, we can see that (x + 1)^4 has a root in Z_5[x].\n\nNow, we can use polynomial long division to find the other roots:\n\n(x^4 + 1) \ufffd (x + 1)\n\nThe quotient is x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 (mod 5). Now, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic again:\n\n1. (x + 1)^4 (mod 5) = 1 (mod 5)\n2. (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) (mod 5) = (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) (mod 1) = 0 (mod 1)\n\nFrom property 2, we can see that x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is congruent to 0 (mod 1). This means that x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is a root of x^4 + 1 in Z_5[x].\n\nNow, we can use polynomial long division again to find the other roots:\n\n(x^4 + 1) \ufffd (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)\n\nThe quotient is x^2 + x (mod 5). Now, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic again:\n\n1. (x + 1)^4 (mod 5) = 1 (mod 5)\n2. (x^2 + x) (mod 5) = (x^2 + x) (mod 1) = 0 (mod 1)\n\nFrom property 2, we can see that x^2 + x is congruent to 0 (mod 1). This means that x^2 + x is a root of x^4 + 1 in Z_5[x].\n\nNow, we can use polynomial long division again to find the other roots:\n\n(x^4 + 1) \ufffd (x^2 + x)\n\nThe quotient is x + 1 (mod 5). Now, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic again:\n\n1. (x + 1)^4 (mod 5) = 1 (mod 5)\n2. (x + 1) (mod 5) = (x + 1) (mod 1) = 0 (mod 1)\n\nFrom property 2, we can see that x + 1 is congruent to 0 (mod 1). This means that x + 1 is a root of x^4 + 1 in Z_5[x].\n\nFinally, we have found the roots of x^4 + 1 in Z_5[x]:\n\nx + 1, x^2 + x, x + 1\n\nNow, we can factor x^4 + 1 in Z_5[x] using these roots:\n\n(x + 1)^4 (mod 5) = 1 (mod 5)\n(x + 1)^",
