Statement 2 | Every ring has a multiplicative identity.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every field is also a ring. This statement is true. A field is a special kind of ring, specifically a commutative ring with unity (a multiplicative identity) and with each element having an additive inverse. In other words, a field is a ring that satisfies all the properties of a field, but it is also a ring in the sense that it has the algebraic structure of a ring.\n\nStatement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity. This statement is false. In general, a ring can have multiple multiplicative identities, and not all rings have a multiplicative identity. For example, consider the ring of integers modulo n, denoted Z/nZ. This ring has no multiplicative identity, as there is no integer a such that a * a = 1 mod n.",
