The UDHR is a multilateral treaty\nB. The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution\nC. The UDHR is a UN Security Council resolution\nD. The UDHR is a declaration adopted by several States at an international conference\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a multilateral treaty.\n\nThe UDHR is a document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948. It sets out the fundamental human rights that are recognized as belonging to all people throughout the world. The UDHR is not a resolution or a decision of the UN Security Council, nor was it adopted by several states at an international conference. Instead, it is a multilateral treaty, which means that it was agreed upon by a group of countries and is legally binding on all of them. Since it is a multilateral treaty, it has the same legal status as other international agreements, such as the Geneva Conventions or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
