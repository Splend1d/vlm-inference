If David can completely cover a cube of side length 2 feet with exactly 16 quarts of paint, how big a cube (in terms of edge length in feet) can David cover with 169 quarts of paint?\n\nA. \\frac{13}{4}\nB. 8\nC. \\frac{13}{2}\nD. 13\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to find the surface area of the cube, which is given by the formula 6s^2, where s is the side length of the cube. We are given that the cube has a side length of 2 feet, so the surface area is 6(2)^2 = 48 square feet.\n\nWe are also given that David can completely cover a cube of side length 2 feet with 16 quarts of paint, which means that the surface area of the cube is directly proportional to the amount of paint needed. Therefore, the surface area of the new cube (with an edge length of x feet) can be represented as kx^2, where k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nWe know that the surface area of the new cube is 169 square quarts, so we can set up the equation 169 = kx^2. To find the value of k, we can rearrange the equation to solve for k: k = 169 / x^2.\n\nNow we can find the value of x by solving the equation 16x^2 = 48. Dividing both sides by 16, we get x^2 = 3. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = 3.\n\nTherefore, the new cube with an edge length of 3 feet can be completely covered with 169 quarts of paint. The answer is D. 13.",
