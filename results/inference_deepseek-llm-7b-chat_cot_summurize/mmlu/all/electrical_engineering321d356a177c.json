Understand the two wattmeter method of power measurement.\n2. Analyze the given statement about the power factor of the system.\n3. Match the power factor value with the available options.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the two wattmeter method of power measurement\n\nThe two wattmeter method of power measurement is a method used to measure the power factor of an AC power system. In this method, two wattmeters are used: one wattmeter measures the real power (active power) and the other measures the apparent power (reactive power). The power factor is calculated as the ratio of the apparent power to the real power.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the given statement about the power factor of the system\n\nThe statement says, \"if the total power is measured by one wattmeter only.\" This means that only one wattmeter is used to measure the total power of the system, which includes both the real power and the reactive power.\n\nStep 3: Matching the power factor value with the available options\n\nSince only one wattmeter is used to measure the total power, it means that the second wattmeter is not providing any information about the reactive power. Therefore, the power factor cannot be accurately calculated using the two wattmeter method. The correct answer is:\n\nD. none of above.",
