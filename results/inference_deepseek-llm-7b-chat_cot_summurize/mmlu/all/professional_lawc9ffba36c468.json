The deed contained the following covenants: (1) seisin, (2) right to convey, and (3) against encumbrances. Subsequently, the landscaper conveyed the property to a buyer by warranty deed. However, the buyer is later evicted by a woman because of paramount title. The buyer now brings suit against the farmer for breach of covenants in the deed. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the buyer, because the covenants contained inthe deed run with the land.\nB. the farmer, because no privity of estate existsbetween the buyer and the farmer.\nC. the buyer, but only for the covenants of seisinand right to convey.\nD. the farmer, because the covenants are personalin nature and do not run with the land.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. the buyer, because the covenants contained in the deed run with the land.\n\nUnder common law, covenants in a deed run with the land and bind the subsequent grantees. In this case, the farmer conveyed the property to the landscaper, who in turn conveyed it to the buyer by warranty deed. Since the covenants contained in the deed run with the land, they bind the subsequent grantees, including the buyer. Therefore, the judgment should be for the buyer.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. no privity of estate exists between the buyer and the farmer. This is not a relevant consideration in determining whether the covenants in the deed run with the land.\n\nC. the buyer, but only for the covenants of seisin and right to convey. This is incorrect because the covenants of seisin and right to convey do run with the land, and therefore bind the buyer.\n\nD. the farmer, because the covenants are personal in nature and do not run with the land. This is incorrect because the covenants in the deed do run with the land and bind the subsequent grantees, including the buyer.",
