Increases.\n\nIn the same period, there is a drought affecting the supply of pineapples, which will cause the equilibrium quantity to decrease. However, there is also a discovery that may assist in the avoidance of cancer, which could increase the demand for pineapples. The increase in demand due to the discovery will offset the decrease in supply due to the drought, leading to an increase in the equilibrium quantity of pineapples.",
