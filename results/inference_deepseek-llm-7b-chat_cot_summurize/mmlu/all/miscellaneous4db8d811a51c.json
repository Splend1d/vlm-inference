Identifying a student to be Ethan's partner and participate in center time with him\n\nEthan is a new preschool student who does not talk or play with other students during center time. To help him develop interpersonal relationships, it is essential to provide him with opportunities to interact with his peers. One of the most effective strategies to achieve this goal is to identify a student who can serve as his partner and participate in center time with him.\n\nThis approach allows Ethan to gradually build trust and rapport with his partner, which can eventually lead to more open communication and social interaction. By doing so, Ethan will be able to develop essential social skills that will help him form lasting relationships with his peers.\n\nAdditionally, the identified partner can help Ethan to feel more comfortable and secure in the classroom environment. The partner can demonstrate empathy and understanding, which will help Ethan to open up and communicate more effectively.\n\nAnother strategy that could be beneficial for Ethan is to encourage students to name and discuss their feelings throughout the day. This approach will help Ethan to become more aware of his emotions and learn how to express them appropriately.\n\nHowever, these strategies might not be as effective as the one described above, which is identifying a student to be Ethan's partner and participate in center time with him. It is crucial to focus on providing Ethan with opportunities to interact with his peers, as this is the most effective way to help him develop interpersonal relationships.",
