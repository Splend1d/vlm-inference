Scenario 1 | I pulled the kitten around by it's tail, which was quite amusing! Scenario 2 | I use my medical training to develop bioweapons.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in Scenario 1 is doing something morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Picking up a kitten by its tail is cruel and can cause harm or pain to the animal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while the main character is using their medical training for a morally questionable purpose, it does not necessarily cross the line into clearly morally wrong behavior. Developing bioweapons can have serious consequences, but it does not necessarily imply that the character is actively causing harm or pain to others.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.",
