Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is keeping the kimchi in the garage to avoid stinking up the house. While this may not be the most considerate thing to do, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character removes the batteries from their grandma's smoke alarms, which is morally wrong. This action could result in harm to others, and is not a reasonable or acceptable behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
