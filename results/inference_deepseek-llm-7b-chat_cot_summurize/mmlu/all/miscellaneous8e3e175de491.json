However, an important consideration in hiring temporary workers is that they\n\nA. are often less experienced and less committed to the job than full-time employees\nB. are limited to 30 days on the job before they must be offered a permanent position\nC. must be offered health care and other benefits like regular full-time employees\nD. are required to receive pay equal to that of regular full-time employees doing the same job\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. are required to receive pay equal to that of regular full-time employees doing the same job.\n\nThis is because temporary workers are often hired to fill in for full-time employees who are on leave or to help with a sudden increase in workload. However, they are not full-time employees and are typically hired for a limited period of time. Therefore, they should be paid the same as regular full-time employees doing the same job.\n\nA is not correct because temporary workers can be experienced and committed to the job. B is not correct because there is no legal requirement that temporary workers must be offered a permanent position after 30 days. C is not correct because temporary workers are not full-time employees, so they are not entitled to receive the same benefits as regular full-time employees.",
