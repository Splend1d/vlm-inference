You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Which products of ADP degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports?\n\nA. Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid.\nB. Ammonia, urea and uric acid.\nC. Ammonia, urea and creatinine.\nD. Ammonia, urea and creatine.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Ammonia, urea, and uric acid. These products of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports.\n\nDuring intense exercise, your body uses a lot of energy, and to generate energy, your body breaks down ADP (adenosine diphosphate) into ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This process is called cellular respiration. As a result of this process, some byproducts, called end products, are produced. Among these end products are ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. These end products are toxic, and the body has to get rid of them. The primary way that the body eliminates these end products is through the bloodstream.\n\nAmmonia, in particular, is a potent toxin that can cause serious damage to the body if it is not properly eliminated. In the blood, ammonia is transported as a conjugate with an amino acid called glutamine. The liver is the primary organ responsible for removing ammonia from the bloodstream. The liver uses ammonia as a source of nitrogen in the production of urea. Urea is then transported to the kidneys, where it is excreted in the urine.\n\nUric acid is another end product produced during cellular respiration. The body can convert uric acid into allantoin, which is then excreted in the urine. The body also produces hypoxanthine, a precursor to uric acid, as a byproduct of cellular respiration. The body can convert hypoxanthine into xanthine oxidase, which can then be converted into uric acid.\n\nIn summary, during multiple sprint sports, the concentration of ammonia, urea, and uric acid increases in the bloodstream. These end products are produced as a result of the body breaking down ADP into ATP during intense exercise.",
