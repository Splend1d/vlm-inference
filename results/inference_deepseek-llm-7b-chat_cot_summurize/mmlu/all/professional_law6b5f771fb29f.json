Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.\n\nThe defendant has preserved the issue for appeal because, by submitting a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence and not objecting when the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, the defendant has put the issue of contributory negligence in the record of the case. As a result, the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction, which can be raised on appeal. The other options are incorrect because the defendant did submit the proposed instruction and failed to object to the judge's failure to give it, which means that the issue has been preserved for appeal.",
