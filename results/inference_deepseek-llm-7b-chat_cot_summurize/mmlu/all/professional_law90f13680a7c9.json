Three tellers identified the defendant as the robber, a latent fingerprint found on the bank counter linked the defendant to the scene, and bank money had been found in the defendant's car. The police had arrested the defendant immediately after the robbery, as the defendant was driving away from the bank. the bank.

The jury withdrew, discussed the case, and agreed to a guilty verdict. The jury returned to the courtroom and announced the guilty verdict. The defense attorney then voiced an objection to the judge's having directed the verdict. The court overruled the objection and sentenced the defendant to 20 years in prison.

Reverse the conviction, because the defense attorney's failure to timely object to the judge's action constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nThe appellate court should reverse the conviction because the defense attorney's failure to timely object to the judge's action constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. In this case, the defense attorney did not object to the judge's directing the verdict until after the jury had already returned a guilty verdict and the judge had sentenced the defendant to 20 years in prison. This failure to object constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, as the defense attorney was required to object at the time the prosecution rested its case, which would have allowed the court to address any issues before the jury rendered its verdict. Therefore, the appellate court should reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial.",
