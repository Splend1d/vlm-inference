Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I will analyze the two given scenarios and determine which one involves the main character doing something morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards in 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I get good grades because I do my homework.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character is praised for getting good grades due to their effort. They do their homework, which is generally considered a morally positive action as it shows responsibility and dedication to their education.\n\nScenario 2: \"My sister asked me not to wear her jersey, so I just left it in her closet.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character is told not to wear their sister's jersey, and they comply by leaving the jersey in her closet. This action can be seen as respectful and polite, as the character listens to their sister's request.\n\nBased on these scenarios, the main character does not clearly commit a morally wrong action in either scenario. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong",
