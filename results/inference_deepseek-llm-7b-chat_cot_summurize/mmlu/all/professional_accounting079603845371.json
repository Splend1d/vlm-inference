A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied with the completed result.\nD. A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one.\n\nassistant:The doctrine of substantial performance refers to a legal principle that a party who has substantially fulfilled their contractual obligations is entitled to payment or other consideration. In other words, if a party has performed most of the obligations required by a contract, they are generally considered to have substantially performed the contract.\n\nIn the given options, the following transactions correctly illustrate the doctrine of substantial performance:\n\nD. A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one.\n\nIn this case, the dentist has substantially performed the contract by competently extracting the tooth, even though they made a mistake in identifying the correct tooth to extract. The error was not due to a lack of effort or good faith, and the dentist is still entitled to be paid for their services.",
