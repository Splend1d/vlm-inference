Clovis\nB. Nenana Complex\nC. Lapita\nD. Micronesian Pottery Tradition\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Lapita.\n\nThe Lapita people were a group of seafaring farmers who migrated from Southeast Asia to the Pacific Islands around 3,500 years ago. They were known for their distinctive pottery style, which featured geometric designs and was made using a technique called \"terracotta,\" in which clay was fired in a pit or on a heated surface.\n\nThe Lapita culture eventually spread across the Pacific, covering a vast area from Fiji to New Caledonia. The Lapita pottery style was eventually applied to the entire cultural complex, making it a cultural phenomenon that transcended geographic boundaries.",
