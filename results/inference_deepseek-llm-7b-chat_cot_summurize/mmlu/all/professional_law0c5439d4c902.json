The alleged victim is called by the prosecution to testify. During her testimony, the victim recounted the incident and described how the defendant savagely beat her with a baseball bat. She was not asked by the prosecution whether she made any statements during the attack. After the victim was excused and left the witness stand, the prosecution called another witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, \"I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this. \"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's proffered testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an excited utterance.\nB. admissible as a dying declaration.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused.\n\nassistant:The statement made by the victim after the attack, \"I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this,\" is not admissible as a dying declaration. A dying declaration is a statement made by a person while facing death or in the immediate aftermath of such a situation, and is admissible as evidence if it is made voluntarily and without any inducement or coercion. In this case, the victim's statement was made after the attack had stopped, and it is not clear whether it was made voluntarily or with any inducement or coercion.\n\nAs for the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, it applies only to statements made in the heat of the moment, immediately after the event, and in response to the event. The victim's statement was made after the attack had stopped, so it would not be admissible as an excited utterance.\n\nTherefore, the statement made by the victim after the attack is inadmissible as a dying declaration and as an excited utterance. It would be inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nThe answer is: C. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
