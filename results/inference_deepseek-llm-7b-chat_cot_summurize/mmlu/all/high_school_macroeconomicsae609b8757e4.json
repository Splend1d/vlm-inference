III and IV only\n\nassistant:The U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced within a country during a specific time period. To determine which of the options are included in the GDP, we need to analyze each option.\n\n1. The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens: This option involves goods and services produced by U.S. citizens, but they are produced in Africa. The GDP only includes goods and services produced within the country. Therefore, this option is not included in the GDP.\n\n2. The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States: This option involves goods and services produced in Italy and sold in the United States. The GDP includes the value of goods and services produced within the country and those that are produced outside the country and sold in the country. Therefore, this option is included in the GDP.\n\n3. The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan: This option involves goods and services produced in the United States and sold in Japan. The GDP includes the value of goods and services produced within the country and those that are produced outside the country and sold in the country. Therefore, this option is included in the GDP.\n\n4. The market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens: This option involves goods and services produced in the United States by Canadian citizens. However, the GDP only includes goods and services produced within the country. Therefore, this option is not included in the GDP.\n\nBased on the analysis above, only options II and III are included in the U.S. GDP. Therefore, the correct answer is C. II and IV only.",
