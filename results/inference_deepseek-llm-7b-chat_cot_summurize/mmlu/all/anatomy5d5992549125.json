Abdominal and pelvic.\n\nThe diaphragm is a muscular partition that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal and pelvic cavities. The cranial and spinal cavities are not separated by the diaphragm, as they are both part of the axial skeleton. The thoracic and abdominal cavities are also not separated by the diaphragm, as they are both part of the axial skeleton. The pericardial and pleural cavities are also not separated by the diaphragm, as they are both separate from the axial skeleton.",
