Which of the following statements is/are true:\n\n\nA. research to define pattern and level of optimal weight gain is ongoing\nB. both inadequate and excessive weight gain are associated with poorer maternal and infant health outcomes\nC. excessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy has been linked to obesity in the offspring\nD. all of the options given are correct\n\nassistant:All of the options given are correct.\n\n* A. Research to define pattern and level of optimal weight gain is ongoing. This statement is true as there is ongoing research to determine the ideal weight gain for pregnant women. However, the optimal range of weight gain may vary depending on factors such as pre-pregnancy BMI and the woman's overall health.\n* B. Both inadequate and excessive weight gain are associated with poorer maternal and infant health outcomes. This statement is true as excessive weight gain in pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications, while inadequate weight gain can lead to low birth weight and other issues.\n* C. Excessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy has been linked to obesity in the offspring. This statement is also true as maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of obesity in the offspring. However, it is important to note that other factors such as genetics and environment also play a role in determining an individual's weight.",
