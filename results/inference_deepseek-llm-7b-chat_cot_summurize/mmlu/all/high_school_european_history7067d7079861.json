This is evident in the dialogue between Pangloss and Candide, where Pangloss, despite his traumatic experiences, maintains his belief in the \"pre-established harmony\" and the \"plenum and materia subtilis,\" which are philosophical concepts that challenge the Catholic Church's teachings. The executioner's failure to hang Pangloss can be seen as a symbol of the flaws and inconsistencies in the Church's dogma and practices, which were being questioned and challenged during the French Enlightenment.",
