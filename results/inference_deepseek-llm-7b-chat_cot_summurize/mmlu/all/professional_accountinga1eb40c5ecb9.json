Calculate the cost of goods sold for the inventory shipped to Omega Co.\n2. Calculate the value of goods received for the inventory received from Gamma Co.\n3. Subtract the cost of goods sold from the value of goods received to determine the net amount of inventory.\n4. Add the net amount of inventory to the opening balance of inventory to find the closing balance.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of goods sold for the inventory shipped to Omega Co.\nCost of goods sold = $36,000 - $1,800 = $34,200\n\nStep 2: Calculate the value of goods received for the inventory received from Gamma Co.\nValue of goods received = $24,000\n\nStep 3: Subtract the cost of goods sold from the value of goods received to determine the net amount of inventory.\nNet amount of inventory = $24,000 - $34,200 = -$10,200\n\nStep 4: Add the net amount of inventory to the opening balance of inventory.\nOpening balance of inventory = -$10,200 (assuming a negative value indicates a decrease in inventory)\nClosing balance of inventory = -$10,200 + $24,000 = $13,800\n\nThe correct answer is D. $37,800",
