The quantum yield (\u03a6_f) in fluorescence spectroscopy is best defined as the number of photons emitted, divided by the number of photons absorbed. It represents the efficiency of the energy transfer from the absorbing molecule to the emitted photon and is expressed as a dimensionless number between 0 and 1.",
