Greatly increases.\n\nWhen small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece, the combined surface area greatly increases. This is because the surface area of a material is the total area that it has, and when the material is assembled into a larger piece, the total surface area becomes larger.\n\nB. slightly increases is incorrect because the surface area of the larger piece would still be larger than the original small pieces.\n\nC. decreases is also incorrect because the surface area of the larger piece would still be larger than the original small pieces.\n\nD. is unchanged is incorrect because when the small pieces are assembled into a larger piece, the combined surface area increases.",
