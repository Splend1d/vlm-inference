Global-local continuum\n\nassistant:The use of inexpensive labor in Asian countries by footwear companies based in the United States and Europe is an example of the Global division of labor. This is because these companies are able to produce their products at a lower cost by utilizing the low labor costs in Asian countries, and then selling them at a higher price in the United States and Europe. This is a clear example of the division of labor, where different tasks are performed in different locations in order to take advantage of the comparative advantages of each location. This can lead to more efficient production and lower prices for consumers.",
