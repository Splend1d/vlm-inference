Sensory memory\nB. Episodic memory\nC. Semantic memory\nD. Procedural memory\n\nassistant:Hi there! As an AI language and vision model, I can help you understand the answer to this question.\n\nAdvanced age is associated with a decline in various types of memory. However, among the types of memory mentioned, episodic memory tends to show the biggest deficit with advanced age. Episodic memory refers to the ability to remember specific events, such as personal experiences and memories, and it is closely linked to the aging process.\n\nSensory memory, semantic memory, and procedural memory can also be affected by aging, but episodic memory is generally considered to be the most vulnerable. This is because episodic memory requires the integration of multiple cognitive processes, such as attention, perception, and language, which can decline with age.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
