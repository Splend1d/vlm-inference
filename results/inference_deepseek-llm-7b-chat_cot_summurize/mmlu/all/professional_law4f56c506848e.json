An implied-in-fact contract.\n\nIn this context, when a client accepts the services of an attorney without an agreement concerning the amount of the fee, there is an implied-in-fact contract. This means that the contract is not explicitly stated, but the conduct of the parties implies its existence. In this case, the client's acceptance of the attorney's services and the attorney's performance of those services create a binding contract.",
