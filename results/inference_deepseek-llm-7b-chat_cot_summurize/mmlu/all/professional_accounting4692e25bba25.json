The discount rate is 10%. What is the project\u2019s NPV?\n\nA. $1,000,000\nB. $300,000\nC. $2,000,000\nD. $242,000\n\nassistant:To calculate the NPV of the investment project, we can use the formula:\n\nNPV = (Net Cash Flows / (1 + discount rate)^time)\n\nIn this case, the net cash flow is the difference between the expected revenue and the cost of the project, which is $2 million - $1 million = $1 million. The discount rate is 10%, and the time frame is five years.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nNPV = ($1,000,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5)\nNPV = ($1,000,000 / 1.10^5)\nNPV = ($1,000,000 / 1.4641)\nNPV = $6,759,578.94\n\nSince the closest answer option is D, the project's NPV is approximately $242,000.",
