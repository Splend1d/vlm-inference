The probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is\n\nA. 1/4\nB. 1/3\nC. 1/2\nD. 2/3\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a player who makes the first toss wins the game.\n\nLet's consider the possible outcomes of the game:\n1. Player 1 wins\n2. Player 2 wins\n\nThere are 2 possible outcomes for each toss: heads or tails. Since the coin is fair, the probability of each outcome is 1/2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the game's outcomes:\n1. Player 1 wins:\n   - Player 1 wins the first toss (heads)\n   - Player 2 wins the second toss (tails)\n   - Player 1 wins the game (Player 1 wins the first toss)\n\n2. Player 2 wins:\n   - Player 1 wins the first toss (heads)\n   - Player 2 wins the second toss (tails)\n   - Player 2 wins the game (Player 2 wins the first toss)\n\nOut of the 4 possible outcomes (Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins), there are 2 cases where Player 1 wins the first toss (Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 2 / 4\nProbability = 1 / 2\n\nSo the answer is C. The probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is 1/2.",
