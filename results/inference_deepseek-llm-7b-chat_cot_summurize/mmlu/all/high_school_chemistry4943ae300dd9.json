You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A certain radioactive material has a half-life of 36 minutes. Starting with 10.00 grams of this material, how many grams will be left after 2 hours?\n\nA. 1.00 grams\nB. 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 grams\nC. 3.33 grams\nD. 0.25 gram\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\nFinal amount = Initial amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 10.00 grams, the half-life is 36 minutes (or 0.5667 hours), and the time elapsed is 2 hours.\n\nFinal amount = 10.00 * (1/2)^(2 / 0.5667)\nFinal amount = 10.00 * (1/2)^(3.6226)\nFinal amount = 10.00 * (1/2)^4\nFinal amount = 10.00 * (1/16)\nFinal amount = 0.625 grams\n\nSo, after 2 hours, there will be 0.625 grams of the radioactive material left. The closest option to this answer is D. 0.25 grams.",
