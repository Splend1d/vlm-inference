The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\nD. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease.\n\nassistant:If consumer confidence increases, it will lead to an increase in the aggregate demand for goods and services. This increase in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, as shown in the figure below.\n\n[Insert Aggregate Demand Curve Shifting Right]\n\nThis shift will result in a higher equilibrium price level and the same equilibrium quantity of output, as the aggregate demand curve intersects the aggregate supply curve at the new equilibrium price level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.",
