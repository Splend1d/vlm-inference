Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character shoots a gun in a hotel lobby because they see a rat. This action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 because they are using excessive force for what appears to be an unnecessary and inappropriate reason.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character wears a short skirt and tank top to a funeral. While this may be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate, it does not necessarily involve doing something clearly morally wrong. Different people may have different opinions on what is considered morally wrong, but in this case, the main character is not doing something that is clearly morally wrong.",
