No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nExplanation: The court may consider the defendant's prior conviction for burglary to impeach the witness's character for truthfulness, but it must balance the probative value of the conviction with its prejudicial effect. If the court finds that the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, it may allow the evidence. If not, the court should not admit the evidence.",
