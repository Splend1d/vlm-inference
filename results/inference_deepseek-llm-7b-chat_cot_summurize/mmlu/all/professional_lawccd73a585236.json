The next day, the wholesaler ascertained that there were only 18 pairs of 3 1/2-inch, right- handed scissors in stock. The wholesaler, however, found that he had six pairs of 3 1/2-inch, lefthanded scissors in stock. Without noti1'ing the stationery store, the wholesaler shipped the 18 pairs of right-handed scissors, along with the six pairs of left-handed scissors, to the stationery store. The stationery store was aware that the wholesale price for the left-handed scissors was $3 per pair, or $1 less than the list price for the right-handed scissors. Was an enforceable contract formed when the wholesaler shipped the 24 pairs of scissors to the stationery store?\n\nA. Yes, because the wholesaler's shipment constituted acceptance of the offer, absent a seasonable notification by the wholesaler to the stationery store that the shipment was made for accommodation only.\nB. Yes, because the wholesaler acted in good faith in making the shipment in reliance on the stationery store's offer.\nC. No, because the wholesaler could accept the stationery store's offer only by a prompt promise to ship the goods ordered.\nD. No, because acceptance by performance of an offer for immediate or prompt shipment is legally binding, unless the nonconforming goods are not reasonably resalable.\n",
