While carbon and oxygen are important elements in living things, glucose is the primary source of energy for cells and is an inorganic compound. Water is also important for life, but it is a compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen. Glucose, on the other hand, is a monosaccharide that is the primary source of energy for cells.",
