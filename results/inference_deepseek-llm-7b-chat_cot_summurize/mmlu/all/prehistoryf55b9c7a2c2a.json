This genetic evidence shows that the earliest human inhabitants of the Americas had a close genetic relationship with present-day Europeans.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it is refuted by genetic evidence, not supported by it.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the genetic evidence in question does not necessarily establish close connections between the oldest skeletons in the Americas and Norse explorers who arrived in northeastern Canada around A.D. 1000.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the complete absence of documents that record a migration of Europeans into the Americas does not necessarily refute the possibility of European colonization.",
