Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?\n\nA. 4\nB. 5\nC. 8\nD. 16\n\nassistant:To find the largest possible value of $k$, we need to find the largest possible value of $n$.\nWe know that the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the geometric series is given by $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1.\nWe are also told that all the numbers in the sequence have the same number of digits.\nTo find the largest possible value of $n$, we need to find the largest possible value of $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$.\nSince $a$ and $r$ are positive integers, the largest possible value of $a$ is 9 (99).\nTo find the largest possible value of $r$, we need to find the largest possible value of $n$.\nSince $r$ is greater than 1, the largest possible value of $n$ is 9 (99/9 = 11).\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$ is 99.\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $k$ is the number of digits in the largest possible value of $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$, which is 2.\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
