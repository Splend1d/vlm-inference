Sporulation\nB. Binary fission\nC. Vegetative propagation\nD. Mutation\n\nassistant:D. Mutation contributes the most to genetic variability in a population. Mutations occur when there is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism, leading to variations in the characteristics of the organism. These variations can be advantageous or disadvantageous, and some may even be beneficial to the survival and reproduction of the species. Mutations are a result of errors that occur during DNA replication, and they can lead to new traits and adaptations in the population.\n\nA. Sporulation is a process in which spores are formed, which are resistant to harsh conditions and can survive for long periods of time. This process does not contribute to genetic variability in a population.\n\nB. Binary fission is a process by which bacteria and other single-celled organisms reproduce. It does not contribute to genetic variability in a population.\n\nC. Vegetative propagation is a process by which plants reproduce by producing new plants from parts of the parent plant, such as roots, stems, or leaves. This process does not contribute to genetic variability in a population.",
