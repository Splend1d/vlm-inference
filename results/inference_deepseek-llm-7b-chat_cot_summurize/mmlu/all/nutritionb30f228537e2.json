Brain\nB. Kidney\nC. Liver\nD. Skeletal Muscle\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the energy expenditure per unit of body mass (kg) for each of these organs:\n\n1. Brain: The brain is responsible for controlling and coordinating various functions in the body, including memory, decision-making, and movement. While it only makes up about 2% of body weight, it uses about 20% of the body's total energy. Therefore, the brain has a relatively high energy expenditure per unit of body mass.\n\n2. Kidney: The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the blood, maintaining electrolyte balance, and regulating blood pressure. They are relatively small organs, making up about 0.5% of the body weight. The kidneys have a low energy expenditure, using about 1% of the body's total energy.\n\n3. Liver: The liver is responsible for detoxification, metabolism, and production of bile. It is the largest internal organ and accounts for about 2-3% of the body's weight. The liver has a moderate energy expenditure, using about 10% of the body's total energy.\n\n4. Skeletal Muscle: The skeletal muscles make up about 40-45% of the body's weight and are responsible for movement and posture. They have a high energy expenditure, using about 20% of the body's total energy.\n\nBased on the energy expenditure per unit of body mass, the kidney has the lowest energy expenditure at about 1% of the body's total energy.",
