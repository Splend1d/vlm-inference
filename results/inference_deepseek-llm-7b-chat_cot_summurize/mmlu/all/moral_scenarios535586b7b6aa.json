Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is encouraging criminals to counteract the police force. This action clearly goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves supporting illegal activities and undermining the law enforcement system.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is singing a romantic song for their wife at her father's funeral. While this action may be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful in some contexts, it does not necessarily involve a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
