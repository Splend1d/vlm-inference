No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\nD. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. In this case, the police officer lied to the woman when she asked if he was a police officer. He also provided her with a false name and told her to call someone else who would vouch for him. This deceitful behavior allowed the officer to enter the woman's home and ultimately seize the evidence.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen - This answer is incorrect because the officer did not know for sure that the cards were stolen. He only discovered them after the woman left the room.\n\nB. No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight - This answer is incorrect because the officer did not seize the cards in plain sight. He lifted them from underneath a desk where the woman had placed them.\n\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers - This answer is incorrect because the officer did not violate the woman's Fourth Amendment rights by lifting the papers. He only discovered the credit cards after lifting the papers.",
