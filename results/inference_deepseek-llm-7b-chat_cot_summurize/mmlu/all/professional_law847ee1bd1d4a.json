This is because the passenger's act of pointing out the overturned vehicle was a supervening cause, meaning that it was not reasonably foreseeable by the owner of the abandoned auto. As a result, the owner of the abandoned auto may be able to argue that they did not create a dangerous condition and were not negligent. Therefore, the driver would only be able to recover a portion of his damages.",
