While epigenetic changes may be key to understanding the links between early experience and later health, they do not directly include changes in DNA methylation. The second statement is correct. Epigenetic modifications can modify gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. The third statement is also correct. Epigenetic modifications can enable one genotype to result in different phenotypes.",
