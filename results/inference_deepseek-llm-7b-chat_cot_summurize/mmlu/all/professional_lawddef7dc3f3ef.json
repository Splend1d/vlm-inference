A life tenant is required to account for any waste made during their possession of the property. In this case, the woman's brother cleared 60 acres of timber from the swampland, which would be considered waste, and the woman is seeking to enjoin him from further waste and account for profits made from the timber. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. is not relevant to the facts of the case. The fact that the swampland had never been used for timber production before is not relevant to the woman's claim for waste or her brother's liability for it.\n\nC. is incorrect because a life tenant is not exempt from accounting for permissive waste, even if they have a right to make reasonable use of the land.\n\nD. is incorrect because a life tenant is indeed liable for permissive waste and must account for it, even if they have a right to make reasonable use of the land.",
