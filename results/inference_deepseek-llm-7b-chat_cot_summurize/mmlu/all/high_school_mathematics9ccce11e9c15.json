(1,1)\n\nassistant:Let $x$ be the number of hours Rowena paints, and $y$ be the number of hours Ruby paints. We want to find the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first condition: If Rowena paints for $x$ hours and Ruby paints for $y$ hours, they will finish half of the painting. This means that $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the room should be painted by Rowena and $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the room should be painted by Ruby.\n\nSince Rowena can paint the room in $14$ hours, she paints at a rate of $\\frac{1}{14}$ of the room per hour. Similarly, Ruby can paint the room in $6$ hours, so she paints at a rate of $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the room per hour.\n\nUsing these rates, we can set up the following equation:\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} \\cdot x + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot y = 1$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$\\frac{1}{28}x + \\frac{1}{12}y = 1$\n\nNow, let's consider the second condition: If Rowena paints for $y$ hours and Ruby paints for $x$ hours, they will paint the whole room. This means that $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the room should be painted by Rowena and $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the room should be painted by Ruby.\n\nUsing the same rates as before, we can set up the following equation:\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} \\cdot y + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot x = 1$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$\\frac{1}{28}y + \\frac{1}{12}x = 1$\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n$\\frac{1}{28}x + \\frac{1}{12}y = 1$\n$\\frac{1}{28}y + \\frac{1}{12}x = 1$\n\nTo solve this system, we can multiply the first equation by $12$ and the second equation by $28$:\n$6x + 4y = 28$\n$6y + 4x = 28$\n\nAdding these two equations together, we get:\n$10x + 8y = 56$\n\nNow, we can subtract this equation from $6x + 4y = 28$:\n$4x = 28 - 56$\n$4x = -28$\n\nDividing both sides by $4$, we find:\n$x = -\\frac{28}{4}$\n$x = -7$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of $x$ into either of the original equations to find $y$. Let's use the first equation:\n$\\frac{1}{28}(-7) + \\frac{1}{12}y = 1$\n$-\\frac{7}{14} + \\frac{1}{12}y = 1$\n$\\frac{1}{24}y = 1 - \\frac{7}{14}$\n$\\frac{1}{24}y = \\frac{7}{14} - 1$\n$\\frac{1}{24}y = \\frac{1}{14}$\n$y = \\frac{14}{24}$\n$y = \\frac{7}{12}$\n\nSo, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ is $(\\frac{-7}{1}, \\frac{7}{12})$.
