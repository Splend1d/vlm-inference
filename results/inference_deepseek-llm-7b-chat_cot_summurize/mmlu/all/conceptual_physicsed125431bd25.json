Speed only\nB. Wavelength only\nC. Both speed and wavelength\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:When light refracts in passing from one medium to another, both the speed and the wavelength of the light can change. This is because the speed of light in a vacuum is different from the speed of light in a different medium. The wavelength of the light can also change if the two media have different indices of refraction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both speed and wavelength.",
