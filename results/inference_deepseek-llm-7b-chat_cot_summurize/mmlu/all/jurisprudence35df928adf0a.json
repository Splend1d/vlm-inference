Rousseau\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I would first need to have a good understanding of the concept of the \"Social Contract\" and the historical figures associated with it. I would also need to know the specific statement in question. \n\nAssuming that the statement is \"Social Contract is not a historical fact but a hypothetical construction of reason\", and that it is attributed to Hobbes, my answer would be A. Hobbes.\n\nHobbes was a political philosopher who argued that people, living in a state of nature, are in a constant state of conflict and that they create a social contract in order to establish a government that can protect them from violence and maintain order. He believed that the social contract is a hypothetical construct, not a historical fact.",
