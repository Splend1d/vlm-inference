The law was passed in order to curtail the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. Two students at a state university are engaged to be married and wish to share a dormitory room together. Citing the law, university housing officials refuse to allow them to live together in a campus dormitory facility. The students bring an appropriate action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Which of the following correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion?\n\nA. Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nB. Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nC. Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.\nD. Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nassistant:The applicable burden of persuasion in this case is that the state must show that the law is substantially related to an important state interest. This is stated in option C. The law requires male and female students to live in separate dormitory facilities, and the students are challenging the constitutionality of the law. The state must show that the law is substantially related to an important state interest in order to uphold the law.\n\nTo understand the context of this question, it's important to know that the law was passed to curb the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. The law is seen as a way to regulate the personal lives of students, and to protect public morality. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the state must show that the law furthers a compelling state interest in privacy, which is not the issue at hand. Option B is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the law deals with the freedom of association, which is not the issue being challenged. Option D is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, which is not the applicable burden of persuasion in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is option C: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.",
