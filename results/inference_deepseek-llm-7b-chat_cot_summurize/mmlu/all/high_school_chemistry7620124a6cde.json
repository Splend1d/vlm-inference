The Ka is 3.0 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 5.4 \u00d7 10^-3\nD. 1.76\n\nassistant:To determine the pH of the solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of a weak acid-strong base buffer system to the equilibrium constant (Ka) and the fraction of the acid in its conjugate base form (f).\n\nThe equation is given by:\n\npH = pKb + log(f)\n\nwhere pKb is the base ionization constant (pKa for a base) and f is the fraction of the acid in its conjugate base form.\n\nIn this case, we have a weak acid-strong base system, so pKb = -log(Ka), and we want to find f.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for f:\n\nf = (pH - pKb) / log(Ka)\n\nFirst, we need to find pKb. We can do this by plugging the given Ka value into the equation:\n\npKb = -log(3.0 \u00d7 10^-4) = 5.61\n\nNow we can find f:\n\nf = (pH - 5.61) / 5.61\n\nNext, we need to find the concentration of the conjugate base, which is equal to the concentration of the acid minus the fraction of the acid in its conjugate base form. We know the concentration of the acid (0.1665 moles / 500 mL = 3.33 mg/mL), so we can write:\n\nc_conjugate_base = c_acid - f * c_acid\n\nSolving for f:\n\nf = (c_acid - c_conjugate_base) / c_acid\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf = (3.33 mg/mL - (c_acid - c_conjugate_base) mg/mL) / 3.33 mg/mL\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the total concentration of the acid and the conjugate base is equal to the molar concentration of the acid:\n\nc_acid + c_conjugate_base = 0.1665 moles / 500 mL = 3.33 mg/mL\n\nSolving for c_conjugate_base:\n\nc_conjugate_base = 3.33 mg/mL - c_acid mg/mL\n\nNow we can plug in the values we found earlier:\n\nf = (3.33 mg/mL - (3.33 mg/mL - (3.33 mg/mL - c_conjugate_base mg/mL))) mg/mL / 3.33 mg/mL\n\nf = (3.33 mg/mL + c_conjugate_base mg/mL) mg/mL / 3.33 mg/mL\n\nSince c_conjugate_base = c_acid - f * c_acid, we can substitute this in:\n\nf = (3.33 mg/mL + (3.33 mg/mL - (3.33 mg/mL - (3.33 mg/mL - (3.33 mg/mL - (3.33 mg/mL - (3.33 mg/mL - c_conjugate_base mg/mL) mg/mL)))) mg/mL) mg/mL / 3.33 mg/mL\n\nThis is a complex expression, but we can simplify it using the fact that f = (pH - pKb) / log(Ka):\n\nf = (pH - 5.61) / 5.61\n\nNow, we can use the fact that pH = 14 - log(pH):\n\npH = 14 - log(14 - f + 5.61)\n\npH = 14 - log(14 - f + 14.61)\n\npH = 14 - (14 - f + 14.61)\n\npH = 14 - 28 + f\n\npH = f - 14\n\nSince we are given the answer choice D. 1.76, we can plug in this value for f:\n\npH = 1.76 - 14\n\npH = -12.24\n\nSince pH must be positive, we have made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe found that f = (pH - 5.61) / 5.61, and we know that pH = 14 - log(pH):\n\npH",
