No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\n\nassistant:The manufacturer will not prevail in enforcing a contract because the retailer withdrew the order before the machines were shipped. The manufacturer's confirmation of the terms and specifications did not change the fact that the order was limited to the terms of the offer, which expressly stated that acceptance was only valid if it occurred before the deadline for delivery. Since the retailer did not accept the offer before the August 1 deadline, the order was never valid in the first place. Therefore, the manufacturer cannot enforce a contract that was never formed. The correct answer is D. No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.",
