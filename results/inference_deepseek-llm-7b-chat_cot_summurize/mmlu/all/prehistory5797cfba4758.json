Wallace Trench.\n\nThe undersea chasm between New Guinea, Australia, and Java, Borneo is called the Wallace Trench. This trench is named after the British naturalist and biologist, Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed the idea of the existence of this chasm. The Wallace Trench is a deep undersea valley that stretches for about 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) and has a maximum depth of around 9,000 meters (29,500 feet). This trench is considered one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth, as it is home to a wide variety of marine life, including many species that are endemic to the region.",
