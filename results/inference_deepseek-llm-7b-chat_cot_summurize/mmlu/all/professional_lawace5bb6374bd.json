Under a written contract, the doctor agreed to surgically remove the growth for $750. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the doctor's office.

The proffered oral agreement regarding payment of the additional $150 concerned a new medical procedure that was unrelated to the subject matter of the prior written contract.\n\nThe patient's objection is based on the fact that the oral agreement being referred to is related to the removal of a mole, which was not part of the original written contract. The written contract only included the surgical removal of the abnormal growth on the patient's shoulder. Therefore, the judge will likely consider this factor when ruling on the patient's objection.",
