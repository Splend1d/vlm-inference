A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\n\nA. 500 nm\nB. 550 nm\nC. 600 nm\nD. 650 nm\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to consider the behavior of light when it interacts with the water-oil interface. The incident light (white light) is normal to the interface, and the index of refraction of water is higher than that of oil. As a result, some of the light will be refracted towards the oil and some towards the water.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. 500 nm: This is the wavelength of the light that is incident on the water-oil interface. Since the index of refraction of oil is higher than that of water, this light will be strongly reflected back towards the water.\n\nB. 550 nm: This is the wavelength of light that is closest to the green color of the light spectrum (546 nm). When the light interacts with the interface, it will experience total internal reflection if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection, which is approximately 48 degrees. However, since this light is closer to the blue end of the spectrum, the angle of incidence will be less than 48 degrees. Therefore, it will be refracted towards the water, not reflected.\n\nC. 600 nm: This is the wavelength of the light that is closest to the red color of the light spectrum (656 nm). When the light interacts with the interface, it will experience total internal reflection if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection, which is approximately 48 degrees. However, since this light is closer to the red end of the spectrum, the angle of incidence will be less than 48 degrees. Therefore, it will be refracted towards the water, not reflected.\n\nD. 650 nm: This is the wavelength of the light that is the farthest from the red color of the light spectrum (656 nm). Since the light is closer to the blue end of the spectrum, it will experience total internal reflection if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection, which is approximately 48 degrees. Therefore, it will be strongly reflected back towards the oil.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 650 nm. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 650 nm.",
