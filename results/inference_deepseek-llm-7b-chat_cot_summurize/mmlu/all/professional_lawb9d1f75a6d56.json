The woman conveyed the land to the friend \"for life.\" So, the friend has a life estate.\n2. When the friend dies, the land is to go to the woman's neighbor \"and her heirs.\" But the neighbor died, and her entire estate was devised to a local charity in her will. So, the charity has a vested remainder.\n3. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend.\n\nBased on these steps, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.",
