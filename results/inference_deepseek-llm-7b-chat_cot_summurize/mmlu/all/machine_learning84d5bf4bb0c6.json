Statement 2| A two layer neural network with linear activation functions is essentially a weighted combination of linear separators, trained on a given dataset; the boosting algorithm built on linear separators also finds a combination of linear separators, therefore these two algorithms will give the same result.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: False\nThe VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension of an SVM with a Radial Basis Kernel is indeed infinite. However, this doesn't necessarily make the SVM worse than one with a polynomial kernel. The VC dimension is a measure of the capacity of a model, and a higher VC dimension doesn't always imply better performance. The choice of kernel depends on the specific problem and data, and a polynomial kernel with a finite VC dimension could be worse than an SVM with a Radial Basis Kernel if the latter performs better on the given data. Therefore, the first statement is False.\n\nStatement 2: True\nA two-layer neural network with linear activation functions can be seen as a weighted combination of linear separators. This is achieved through the chain rule of differentiation, where each linear activation function in the first layer is a composition of a linear function and the sigmoid function, and the second layer's linear activation functions are derived from the first layer's activations. The boosting algorithm, which also trains linear separators, finds a different way to combine these linear separators to achieve the same goal of classification. Therefore, the two algorithms will indeed give the same result. So, the second statement is True.\n\nThe correct answer is C: True, False.",
