Yes, because negligence per se is a final judgment of total negligence against the driver and it cannot be modified or rebutted.\n\nThe woman's claim is that the car driver was negligent per se, which means that the driver's negligence was so clear and obvious that it amounts to a final judgment of total negligence. This would prevent the man from asserting comparative negligence under a state statute. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The last clear chance to avoid the accident does not necessarily abrogate the comparative negligence law. It may still be relevant, but it does not automatically prevent the man from asserting comparative negligence.\n\nC. The common law doctrine of negligence per se does not necessarily abrogate the defendant's right to apportion fault under the comparative negligence statute. It simply means that the defendant's negligence was clear and obvious, but it does not necessarily prevent the defendant from asserting comparative negligence.\n\nD. The woman's assumption of the risk argument does not necessarily prevent the man from asserting comparative negligence. The woman's assumption of the risk does not necessarily mean that the man was not negligent per se.",
