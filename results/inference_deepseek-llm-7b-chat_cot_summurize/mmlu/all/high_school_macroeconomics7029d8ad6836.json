When the discount rate is lowered, it makes borrowing cheaper for depository institutions, encouraging them to lend more money. This, in turn, can lead to an increase in the money supply, which can help boost economic growth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. give depository institutions a break on their borrowings.",
