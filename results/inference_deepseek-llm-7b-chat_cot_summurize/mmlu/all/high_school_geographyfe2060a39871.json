Stimulus\nB. Contagious\nC. Hierarchal\nD. Relocation\n\nassistant:The use and spread of English in nineteenth-century India is an example of Contagious diffusion. This type of diffusion occurs when a new idea, concept, or innovation spreads from person to person, often through interpersonal relationships and networks. In the case of English in India, it was spread by British colonial administrators and missionaries, who spoke and used the language with Indian elites, who then adopted it and spread it further. This process was also aided by the British educational system, which promoted the use of English as the language of education and administration.",
