Freeing the peasants from their landlords in exchange for their support\n\nassistant:Lenin is saying that the New Economic Policy (NEP) needs to be fixed in the speech above. The New Economic Policy was a policy implemented by the Soviet government in 1921 after the Russian Civil War. This policy allowed for a market economy to exist alongside the planned economy, with the government regulating prices and production. Lenin is arguing in this speech that this policy needs to be changed because it is not allowing for the rapid development of industry that is necessary for the country's defense. He believes that the country cannot continue to rely on a market economy and small-scale agriculture while also trying to build a socialist society. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Freeing the peasants from their landlords in exchange for their support.",
