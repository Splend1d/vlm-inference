The contract specified that the supplier was to provide good quality split redwood poles that were 7 feet long and 6 feet high. Since the poles in the August shipment did not meet these specifications, the fence company had the right to refuse delivery and request a replacement or a price adjustment. The president's refusal to replace the nonconforming poles is a valid reason for the fence company's actions and the lumber supplier's potential lawsuit.\n\nA. is incorrect because all deliveries to date had been timely, but this does not absolve the supplier of responsibility for the nonconforming poles in the August shipment.\nB. is incorrect because the president's offer to adjust the price for the August shipment was rejected by the fence company, not accepted. This would not have provided a valid reason for the fence company's actions.\nD. is incorrect because the nonconforming poles in the August shipment were the primary reason for the fence company's decision to cancel future deliveries and return the last shipment. This deviation impaired the value of the entire contract, but it was the supplier's failure to meet their obligations that led to the breach, not the fence company's actions.",
