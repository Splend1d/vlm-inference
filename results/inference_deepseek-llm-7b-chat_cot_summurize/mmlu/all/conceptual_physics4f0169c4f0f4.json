Higher than 30\u00b0C\n\nassistant:The mixed temperature of the two waters can be found using the formula:\n\nMixed temperature = (20\u00b0C \u00d7 1 + 28\u00b0C \u00d7 2) / (20\u00b0C + 28\u00b0C)\n\nUsing this formula, we get:\n\nMixed temperature = (20 \u00d7 1 + 28 \u00d7 2) / (20 + 28) = (20 + 56) / 48 = 76 / 48 = 1.5833\u00b0C\n\nSo, the mixed temperature is approximately 1.58\u00b0C.\n\nA. 19\u00b0C is too low.\nB. 22\u00b0C is too low.\nC. 30\u00b0C is too high.\nD. Higher than 30\u00b0C is too high.\n\nThe closest answer is E. 1.5\u00b0C.",
