Lower government spending \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increasing the reserve ratio\nD. Higher taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying Treasury securities\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\nA. Higher taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Selling Treasury securities\n- Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. Higher taxes would likely be considered contractionary fiscal policy, while selling Treasury securities could be considered either expansionary or contractionary depending on the context.\n\nB. Lower taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying Treasury securities\n- Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. Lower taxes would likely be considered expansionary fiscal policy, and buying Treasury securities could be considered either expansionary or contractionary depending on the context.\n\nC. Lower government spending \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increasing the reserve ratio\n- Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. Lower government spending would likely be considered contractionary fiscal policy, and increasing the reserve ratio is a monetary policy measure.\n\nD. Higher taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying Treasury securities\n- Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. Higher taxes would likely be considered contractionary fiscal policy, and buying Treasury securities could be considered either expansionary or contractionary depending on the context.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, none of them represent a combination of contractionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policy. The closest answer would be option B, which involves lower taxes (expansionary fiscal policy) and buying Treasury securities (expansionary or contractionary depending on the context). However, this is not the ideal answer as the correct combination does not exist.",
