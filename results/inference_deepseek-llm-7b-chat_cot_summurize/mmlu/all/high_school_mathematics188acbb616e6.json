There are 9 choices for the hundreds place.\n\nThe tens place can be any digit from 0 to 9 (since it cannot be the same as the hundreds place). There are 10 choices for the tens place.\n\nThe units place can be any odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). There are 5 choices for the units place.\n\nThe thousands place can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0). There are 9 choices for the thousands place.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of choices for each digit to find the total number of 4-digit integers with only odd digits:\n\n9 (hundreds place) * 10 (tens place) * 5 (units place) * 9 (thousands place) = 4050\n\nHowever, this count includes all 4-digit integers with only odd digits, including negative integers. We need to subtract the number of negative 4-digit integers with only odd digits to get the correct answer.\n\nTo find the number of negative 4-digit integers with only odd digits, we can use the same logic as before, but with the restrictions that the hundreds, tens, and units place can be any odd digit (1, 3, 5, or 7) and the thousands place can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0).\n\nThe number of negative 4-digit integers with only odd digits is the same as the number of positive 4-digit integers with only odd digits, since we are considering the same digits in the same positions but in reverse order.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive 4-digit integers with only odd digits is greater than the number of negative 4-digit integers with only odd digits.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 500",
