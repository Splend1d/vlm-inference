The factory may not appeal, because the denial of summary judgment is a collateral order.\n\nassistant:The attorney should advise the factory that it may not appeal the court's denial of summary judgment, as the denial of summary judgment is considered a collateral order. A collateral order is a final judgment or order that is not immediately appealable but that may be reviewed on certiorari or mandamus. In this case, the denial of summary judgment may be reviewed on certiorari, as it involves a controlling question of law. Therefore, the factory should not appeal the court's denial of summary judgment. The correct answer is D.",
