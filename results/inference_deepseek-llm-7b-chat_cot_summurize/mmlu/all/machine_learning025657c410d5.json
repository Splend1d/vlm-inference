True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1 is true. The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximation algorithm because it is an iterative optimization algorithm that aims to maximize the expected log-likelihood of the data.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, which means it can be used in situations where the learner does not have prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment. It learns the mapping from actions to rewards through trial and error, without the need for prior knowledge.",
