At very high speeds, an object appears to an observer at rest to be shorter in the direction perpendicular to travel. This is because the object's length is the product of its width and height, and as the object travels at high speeds, the width and height of the object are contracted in the direction of travel, while the length remains the same. Therefore, the object appears shorter in the direction perpendicular to travel.",
