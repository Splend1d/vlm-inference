It is composed of four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The order of these nucleotides in DNA is determined by the sequence of hydrogen bonds between them, and this sequence determines the genetic information of the organism.\n\nIn DNA, adenine (A) normally pairs with thymine (T), while guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). This pairing is known as the base pair, and it is a crucial aspect of DNA replication and gene expression. When DNA is replicated, the base pairs are broken apart and new pairs are formed to create a complementary strand of DNA. This process is essential for the continuity of genetic information and the development of new cells.",
