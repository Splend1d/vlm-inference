Condensation is the process by which a substance changes from a gaseous state to a liquid state. When this occurs, the air temperature will tend to decrease because the heat energy required for the molecules to change state is transferred from the air to the condensing substance. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. decrease",
