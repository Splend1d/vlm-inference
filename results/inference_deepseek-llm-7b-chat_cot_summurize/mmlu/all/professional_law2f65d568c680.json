The fact that the lawyer's right of first refusal does not violate the Rule against Perpetuities or that the friend has a reciprocal right of first refusal is not relevant to the issue at hand. The question is whether the rights of first refusal are reasonable or not. The clause in the deed is unreasonable because it unreasonably restricts the owner's right to sell or transfer his property. The lawyer's right of first refusal is unreasonable because it requires the grantee to purchase the property on the same terms and conditions as proposed, even if the grantee does not want to purchase the property. The friend's right of first refusal is also unreasonable because it requires the grantor to purchase the property on the same terms and conditions as proposed, even if the grantor does not want to purchase the property. Therefore, the lawyer will most likely lose the case.",
