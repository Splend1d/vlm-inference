Scott and Michael are fraternal (dizygotic) twins that were reared together. Given the results of heritability studies of intelligence, which of the following outcomes are most likely to emerge?\n\nA. Jim and Tim will have very similar IQs.\nB. Scott and Michael will have very similar IQs.\nC. Both pairs will have very similar IQs.\nD. Neither pair will have similar IQs.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to consider the heritability of intelligence and the rearing together condition. \n\nThe heritability of intelligence is the proportion of the variance in intelligence that is attributed to genetic factors. If the heritability is high, then the influence of genes on intelligence is strong. \n\nThe rearing together condition means that the twins were raised together, which can affect their similarity in intelligence. If the twins are identical (monozygotic) twins, then they share 100% of their genes, so their intelligence is entirely determined by their genetic makeup. If they are fraternal (dizygotic) twins, they share only 50% of their genes, so their intelligence is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Jim and Tim are identical twins, so their IQs will be very similar, regardless of their rearing together condition.\n\nB. Scott and Michael are fraternal twins, so their IQs will be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, making it unlikely for them to have very similar IQs, even if they were raised together.\n\nC. Both pairs will have very similar IQs. This is incorrect because Jim and Tim are identical twins and Scott and Michael are fraternal twins, which means they have different rearing together conditions.\n\nD. Neither pair will have similar IQs. This is also incorrect because Jim and Tim are identical twins, which means they will have very similar IQs.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcomes are A and B. Jim and Tim will have very similar IQs and Scott and Michael will have similar IQs, despite their rearing together conditions.",
