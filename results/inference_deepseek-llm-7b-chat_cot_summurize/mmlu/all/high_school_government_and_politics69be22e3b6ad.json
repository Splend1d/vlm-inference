Once Congress has created an administrative agency, that agency can be dissolved only by a constitutional amendment.\nD. State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck a balance between the establishment clause, which prohibits the government from establishing a religion, and the free-exercise clause, which guarantees the right to freely practice one's religion. This balance is often referred to as the \"wall of separation between church and state.\" The court has held that the government may not promote or endorse religion, but it also protects the right of individuals and groups to practice their faith.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, including the right to express one's religious beliefs.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Supreme Court has held that once a church has been recognized by the government, it can be subjected to the same laws as other secular organizations, and its tax-exempt status can be revoked for violating those laws.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Supreme Court has held that constitutional amendments can change the structure of the government, but they cannot change the text of the Constitution itself.",
