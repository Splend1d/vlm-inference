If the expected return on its equity is estimated at 12% and its shares are currently quoted on London Stock Exchange at $75, what should the dividend growth rate be to ensure that the price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity?\n\nA. 0%\nB. 8%\nC. 16%\nD. -4%\n\nassistant:To find the dividend growth rate to ensure that the price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity, we can use the Gordon Growth Model, which is a stock valuation model. The formula for the model is:\n\nP = D / (r - g)\n\nWhere:\nP is the current price of the stock\nD is the expected dividend\nr is the expected return on equity\ng is the dividend growth rate\n\nWe are given the following values:\nP = $75\nD = $3\nr = 12% = 0.12\n\nFirst, we need to find the expected dividend for the next period (D_next). We can use the formula:\n\nD_next = D * (1 + g)\n\nWe don't have the exact value of D_next, but we can use the growth rate to find it. We are given the answer choice B, which is 8%. So, let's assume the dividend growth rate is 8%:\n\nD_next = $3 * (1 + 0.08) = $3 * 1.08 = $3.24\n\nNow, we can find the price per share for the next period (P_next) using the Gordon Growth Model:\n\nP_next = D_next / (r - g)\n\nP_next = $3.24 / (0.12 - 0.08) = $3.24 / 0.04 = $81\n\nThe current price of the stock ($75) should be equal to the price per share for the next period ($81), so the growth rate of the dividend should be 8%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 8%.",
