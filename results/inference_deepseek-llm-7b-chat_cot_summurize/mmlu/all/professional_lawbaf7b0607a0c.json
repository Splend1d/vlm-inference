He was unfamiliar with guns and thought that the safety lock was on. When the store manager refused to give him any money, the man shook the gun at her to scare her into cooperating. The gun fired, killing the manager. A clerk ran in from the back stockroom. The man fired a shot into the air to scare the clerk. Unbeknownst to the man, the clerk had a heart condition, and the fright caused her to suffer a fatal heart attack. Can the man properly be convicted of felony murder?\n\nA. No.\nB. Yes, but only for the death of the store manager.\nC. Yes, but only for the death of the clerk.\nD. Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk.\n\nassistant:The man cannot properly be convicted of felony murder in this situation. Felony murder is a charge that can be brought when a defendant is committing a felony (such as robbery) and a death occurs during the course of that felony. In this case, the man intended to commit robbery, but he did not intend for anyone to die. The store manager's death was an unintended consequence of the man's actions, and the clerk's death was also an unintended consequence. Therefore, the man cannot be convicted of felony murder for both deaths.\n\nHowever, the man can still be convicted of other charges related to the incident, such as armed robbery or negligent manslaughter. The prosecutor would have to prove that the man acted with criminal negligence and that his actions were a substantial factor in causing the deaths of the store manager and the clerk. If the prosecutor can prove this beyond a reasonable doubt, then the man could be convicted of those charges.",
