The investor is protected by the recording statute.\n\nIn this scenario, the buyer sold the 20-acre tract of land to the owner for $40,000 on May 1, but did not record the quitclaim deed. The owner then sold the same land to the investor for $75,000 on August 1, this time using a warranty deed. The investor did not record the warranty deed until August 15, while the buyer recorded his quitclaim deed on August 10.\n\nUnder the recording statute in effect, a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration and without notice is not good against an earlier purchaser. In this case, the investor is the subsequent purchaser who took title by warranty deed, and the buyer is the earlier purchaser who took title by quitclaim deed. Since the buyer's deed was not recorded prior to the investor's deed, the investor is protected by the recording statute and is entitled to quiet title to the land.",
