Neoplatonism\nB. Antitrinitarianism\nC. Pietism\nD. Rationalism\n\nassistant:The type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to the Southern Renaissance movement. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pietism. Pietism is a movement in Christianity that emphasizes personal piety and devotion, as well as a commitment to social justice and reform. It originated in Germany in the early 17th century and spread throughout Europe, including the Netherlands. Erasmus was a proponent of humanism, which emphasized the study of classical literature and culture, and believed that it could help people write more elegantly and effectively. Pietism also emphasizes the importance of personal growth and development, and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. Therefore, it is not surprising that Erasmus's approach to humanism, which aimed to make the treasures of classic culture more accessible to a wider audience, is similar to the goals of the Southern Renaissance movement.",
