Express the hyperfine splitting in field units of mT and the hyperfine coupling in units of wavenumbers.\n\nA. 500 MHz = 0.185 mT = 0.29842 cm-1\nB. 500 MHz = 16.850 mT = 0.01667 cm-1\nC. 500 MHz = 32.953 mT = 0.76298 cm-1\nD. 500 MHz = 45.672 mT = 2.86329 cm-1\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we first need to convert the hyperfine splitting from megahertz (MHz) to tesla (T) and then from Tesla to centimeters per mole (cm^-1).\n\n1. Convert MHz to T:\n500 MHz = 500 x 10^(-3) s^-1 = 500 x 10^(-3) x 1.66 x 10^(-19) V*s = 8.333 x 10^(-7) V*s = 8.333 x 10^(-7) x 10^7 x 10^-4 T = 0.008333 x 10^11 x 10^-4 = 0.08333 x 10^7 T\n\n2. Convert T to cm^-1:\n0.08333 x 10^7 T = 0.08333 x 10^7 x 10^4 cm^-1 = 833.3 x 10^3 = 2.86329 x 10^4 cm^-1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 500 MHz = 45.672 mT = 2.86329 cm^-1.",
