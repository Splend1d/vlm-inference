What is the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle?\n\nA. Zero\nB. 4.9 m/s^2\nC. 9.8 m/s^2\nD. 8.9 m/s^2\n\nassistant:The gravitational acceleration experienced by an object in orbit around a planet can be calculated using the formula:\n\ng\\_orbit = (G * M / r^2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the radius of the orbit.\n\nThe gravitational constant G is approximately 6.674 * 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2. The mass of the Earth M is approximately 5.972 * 10^24 kg. The radius of the orbit r is given as 300 km, which is equivalent to 0.003 * 10^8 m.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\ng\\_orbit = (6.674 * 10^-11 * 5.972 * 10^24 / (0.003 * 10^8)^2) = 4.9 m/s^2\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 4.9 m/s^2.",
