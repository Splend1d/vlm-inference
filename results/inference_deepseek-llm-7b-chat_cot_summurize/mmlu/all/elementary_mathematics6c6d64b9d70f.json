What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a cube with a side length of 2.3 centimeters?\n\nA. 5.29\nB. 6.9\nC. 8.027\nD. 12.167\n\nassistant:To calculate the volume of a cube, you can use the formula V = s^3, where s is the side length of the cube. Given that the side length is 2.3 centimeters, you can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (2.3 cm)^3\nV = 5.29 cm^3\n\nSo the volume of the cube is approximately 5.29 cubic centimeters.
