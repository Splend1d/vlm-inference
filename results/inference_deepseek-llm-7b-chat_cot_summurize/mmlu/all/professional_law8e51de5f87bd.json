Each party was driving his own car, and the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had sped through a red light and collided with the plaintiff's car. The defendant denied this allegation. During the trial, the plaintiff testified that he and the defendant had conferred after the accident and that the defendant had said, \"Don't worry about anything; I'll see to it that your doctor's bills are paid. \" The defendant's attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule this testimony\n\nA. admissible, because the defendant admitted his negligence.\nB. admissible, because it is a declaration against interest.\nC. inadmissible, because the prejudice in admitting the testimony outweighs its probative value.\nD. inadmissible, because an offer to pay medical bills is not admissible to prove negligence.\n\nassistant:The trial judge should rule this testimony C. inadmissible, because an offer to pay medical bills is not admissible to prove negligence.\n\nThe plaintiff's testimony regarding the defendant's statement about paying the doctor's bills is not admissible in court. This is because statements made to a party involved in an accident, such as the plaintiff, are not admissible as evidence of negligence. The defendant's statement was made to the plaintiff, not to the court, and therefore, it cannot be used to prove that the defendant was negligent.\n\nAdmitting this testimony would be unfair to the defendant, as it would allow the plaintiff to use the defendant's statement against him, even though it was not intended to be used as evidence in the trial. Additionally, admitting this testimony would not provide any relevant information to the court about the defendant's negligence, as it does not address the circumstances of the accident or the defendant's actions leading up to the collision.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should rule this testimony inadmissible, as it would be unfair to the defendant and would not provide relevant information to the court.",
