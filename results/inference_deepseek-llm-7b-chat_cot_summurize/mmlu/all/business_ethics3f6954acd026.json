Supply loops, Recapture, Waste\nB. Supply loops, Redesign, Profit\nC. Global production networks, Recapture, Waste\nD. Global production networks, Redesign, Profit\n\nassistant:The answer is D. Global production networks, Redesign, Profit.\n\nJustification:\nThe user is describing a process of replacing supply chains with something else that enhances the importance of product and a fundamental redesign of every activity a firm engages in that produces.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the word \"loops\" is not suitable for describing the replacement of supply chains.\n\nOption B is incorrect because \"Recapture\" is not clear in the context of supply chains.\n\nOption C is incorrect because \"Waste\" is not clear in the context of supply chains.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, fits the context of the question. \"Global production networks\" is a suitable replacement for supply chains, and \"Redesign\" is a suitable term for the fundamental redesign of every activity, and \"Profit\" is a suitable term for the importance of product in the context of business.",
