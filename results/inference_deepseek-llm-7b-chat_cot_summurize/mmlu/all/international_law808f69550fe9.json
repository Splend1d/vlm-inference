Treaties, custom and General Assembly Resolutions\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Custom, treaties and judicial decisions.\n\nFormal sources of international law include custom, treaties, and judicial decisions. Custom refers to the established practices and usages of states in their international relations, while treaties are formal agreements between states that create legal obligations. Judicial decisions, or the interpretation of international law by international courts and tribunals, can also be considered a formal source of international law.\n\nOption B is incorrect because general principles of law and theory are not considered formal sources of international law. Option C is incorrect because general Assembly resolutions are not considered formal sources of international law. Option D is incorrect because General Assembly resolutions are not considered formal sources of international law.",
