However, nominees of political bodies or any independent candidate may only have their names placed on the ballot if they file a nominating petition signed by not less than 7% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the offices that they are seeking. The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, which is also the deadline governing party candidates in party primaries.

The code requires that political parties must receive 20% or more of the vote in a gubernatorial or presidential election to be considered a political party. Other political organizations are considered political bodies, and nominees from these bodies or independent candidates must file a nominating petition with a certain number of signatures to be placed on the ballot.\n\nThe user also mentioned an independent candidate who challenges the constitutionality of this election law. They asked the court to declare this statute unconstitutional, and provided two possible reasons for this: either it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech, or it violates the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is either A or B. Since the user did not provide a third reason, I will choose one of the given options. In this case, I will choose A, as the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech are typically invoked in cases involving restrictions on political expression.",
