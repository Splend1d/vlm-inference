None of the above are true statements.\n\nassistant:A. A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to use systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA (Automobile Association of America) members in the city.\n\nThis statement is true. Using systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA members would be a reasonable and cost-saving procedure for the insurance company to use. This method ensures that each member has an equal chance of being included in the sample, and it would be efficient to use a pre-existing list of members.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Randomly choosing families and including all drivers in each of these families in the sample would not be a cost-saving procedure, as it would require more resources and time to gather information from all drivers in each family.\n\nC. The randomness of choosing a sample of drivers is important for obtaining a representative sample, as it ensures that all drivers in the city have an equal chance of being included in the sample. A very large sample size alone does not guarantee a representative sample.\n\nD. A true statement can be found in option A.",
