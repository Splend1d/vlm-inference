If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\n\nA. 0\nB. 1/4\nC. 1/3\nD. 1/2\n\nassistant:Let's use the conservation of momentum and energy to solve this problem.\n\n1. Conservation of momentum: p_initial = p_final\n\nThe initial momentum of the combined system (2m + m) is p_initial = (2m + m)v_initial.\nThe final momentum of the combined system is p_final = (2m + m)v_final.\n\n2. Conservation of energy: K_initial = K_final\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the combined system is K_initial = (2m + m)v_initial^2 / 2m.\nThe final kinetic energy of the combined system is K_final = (2m + m)v_final^2 / 2m.\n\nSince the particles stick together after the collision, their velocities remain the same before and after the collision. Therefore, v_initial = v_final.\n\nSubstituting this into the equations, we get:\n\np_initial = p_final\n(2m + m)v_initial = (2m + m)v_initial\nK_initial = K_final\n(2m + m)v_initial^2 / 2m = (2m + m)v_initial^2 / 2m\n\nSolving this equation for the initial kinetic energy, we get:\n\nK_initial = K_final\n\nSince the initial and final kinetic energies are equal, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is 0.",
