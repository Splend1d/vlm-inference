An externality is a consequence of an action or decision that is not reflected in the price of the product or service and thus affects others, often in a negative way. In this case, the action of economic activity by wealthy nations is causing pollution, which is an externality. This pollution can have negative impacts on the world's poor, as it can lead to health problems, loss of livelihood, and other negative consequences.\n\nA. unequal social order is not a consequence of economic activity, but rather a result of social and political structures. B. authoritarian regimes are also not a direct consequence of economic activity, but rather a form of governance. C. crime is not typically associated with economic activity, but rather with social and individual behaviors.",
