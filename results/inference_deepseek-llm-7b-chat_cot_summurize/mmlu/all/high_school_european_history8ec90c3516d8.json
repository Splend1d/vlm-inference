Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nassistant:Voltaire's quote reflects the Enlightenment belief in the importance of reason and tolerance in addressing social and cultural issues. He uses the tragic events of the Lisbon earthquake to illustrate the idea that humans should not persecute each other and that religious institutions are not exempt from the consequences of natural disasters. This perspective is best illustrated by option D: Many Enlightenment intellectuals believed that new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nOption A is incorrect because although some Enlightenment intellectuals were accomplished scientists, this was not a characteristic that all shared. Option B is incorrect because while salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets were methods of communication used by some Enlightenment thinkers, this was not a characteristic that defined them as a whole. Option C is incorrect because while some Enlightenment intellectuals rejected religion altogether, this was not a characteristic that all shared.",
