Four\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Two. The protein is synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and then imported into the thylakoid space through a protein translocator called the Photosystem II complex. Once in the thylakoid space, the protein must cross through another membrane bilayer to reach its final location in the lumen of the thylakoid.",
