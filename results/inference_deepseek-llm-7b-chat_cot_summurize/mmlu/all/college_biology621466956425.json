If the benefits gained from the trait exceed the cost of the trait to the animal performing them, that trait will persist in the genome. This is in line with the optimality theory, which states that traits will persist in a population if they provide more benefits than the costs they incur.\n\nOption B is not a direct representation of the optimality theory. It talks about the best return for the cost relative to alternative forms of the trait, but it does not mention the concept of benefits exceeding costs.\n\nOption C is also not a direct representation of the optimality theory. It states that beneficial traits are always worth the cost to the organism in energy and physiology, but it does not mention the concept of benefits exceeding costs.\n\nOption D is not a direct representation of the optimality theory either. It talks about the relative fitness of an organism being improved due to a specific trait, but it does not mention the concept of benefits exceeding costs.",
