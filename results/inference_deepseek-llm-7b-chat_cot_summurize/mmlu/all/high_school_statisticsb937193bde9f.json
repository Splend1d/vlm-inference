If the number of calories per candy bar is normally distributed, what percent of candy bars contain more than 225 calories?\n\nA. 66.80%\nB. 47.70%\nC. 43.30%\nD. 6.68%\n\nassistant:We can use the z-score formula to find the z-score for a candy bar with 225 calories. The z-score is the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean.\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere z = z-score, x = 225 (the number of calories), \u03bc = 210 (the mean), and \u03c3 = 10 (the standard deviation).\n\n225 - 210 = 15\n10 / 10 = 1\n\nz = 15 / 10 = 1.5\n\nNow we can use a standard normal distribution table to find the probability that a candy bar has a z-score greater than 1.5.\n\nP(Z > 1.5) = 0.923\n\nSince we want the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we can multiply this probability by 100:\n\n0.923 * 100 = 92.3%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 66.80%.",
