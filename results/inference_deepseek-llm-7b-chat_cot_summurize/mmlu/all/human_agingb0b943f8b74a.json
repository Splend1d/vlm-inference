Mechanistic\nB. Continuous\nC. Organismic\nD. Nurturant\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Continuous.\n\nChanges in the reproductive system are more continuous for men but not for women. This is because, in comparison to women, men have a more continuous pattern of reproductive changes throughout their lives. For example, men go through puberty, which is a period of rapid changes in their reproductive system, and then experience regular testosterone production that leads to the growth of body hair and the deepening of their voice. On the other hand, women's reproductive system undergoes changes during puberty, but once they reach menopause, their reproductive system stops functioning.",
