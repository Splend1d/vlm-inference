In the study, eight healthy individuals, disguised as mentally ill patients, were admitted to eight different psychiatric hospitals in the United States. The aim was to see if they could be admitted without any signs of mental illness.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the eight individuals were admitted to the hospitals without any difficulty, and they were treated as if they had genuine mental illnesses. The study concluded that it is difficult to convince medical professionals that one does not have a mental illness, as they often rely on subjective judgments and rely on diagnostic labels to make a diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.",
