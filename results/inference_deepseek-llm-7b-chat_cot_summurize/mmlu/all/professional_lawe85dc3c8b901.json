The owner showed that a different placement of the house would not interfere with her use and enjoyment of her residence. The trial judge ruled in favor of the defendant on the basis that the defendant had a right to build his house anywhere as long as he followed the building/zoning laws. The owner appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the trial court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\nB. Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\nC. No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.\nD.

Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\n\nThe appellate court may likely reverse the trial court's decision because blocking a neighbor's sunlight could constitute a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process. Due process is a fundamental right that protects individuals from arbitrary and capricious government actions that infringe upon their private property rights. In this case, the neighbor's construction of his house would completely block the owner's access to daily sunlight, which could be considered a fundamental right to light and air. Therefore, the appellate court may find that the trial court's ruling in favor of the defendant is a violation of the owner's substantive due process rights.",
