Which molecules are best represented by multiple resonance structures?\n\nA. CO2 and CO32-\nB. NO2- and NO3-\nC. CO32- and NO3-\nD. CO32-, NO2- and NO3-\n\nassistant:All four molecules can be represented by multiple resonance structures: CO2, CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-. This is because all of these molecules have a delocalized electron cloud, which leads to the formation of resonance structures. Each of these molecules has a central atom with a double or triple bond, and the presence of these bonds leads to the formation of multiple resonance structures. Therefore, the answer is D. CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-.",
