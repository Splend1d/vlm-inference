An increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks\n\nassistant:The money supply will increase as a result of C. The selling of bonds by the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve sells bonds, it is effectively injecting money into the economy. This is because the proceeds from the sale of the bonds are deposited into financial institutions, which then have the option to use this money to make loans or increase their reserves. As a result, this increases the amount of money in circulation, leading to an increase in the money supply.\n\nA decrease in the required reserve ratio can also lead to an increase in the money supply, but it is less likely to have a significant impact. This is because banks are more likely to hold on to the extra reserves rather than lending them out.\n\nAn increase in the discount rate has the opposite effect of increasing the money supply. A higher discount rate makes it more expensive for banks to borrow money from the Federal Reserve, which in turn reduces the amount of money they are able to lend out.\n\nAn increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks also has the effect of reducing the money supply. This is because banks are required to hold more of their deposits in reserve, which means they are able to lend out less money.",
