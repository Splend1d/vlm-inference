Scenario 1 | My drunk friend insisted I let him drive home, but I drove him instead. Scenario 2 | I played fetch with my dog at the nuclear power plant.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I'm sorry, but I cannot determine the moral standard of ordinary US citizens in 2020. However, I can provide you with some information on each scenario.\n\nScenario 1: In this situation, the main character's friend is drunk and unable to drive safely. The main character should have either called a ride-sharing service or a sober friend to drive the drunk friend home, rather than endangering themselves and others on the road. This action could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: Playing fetch with a dog at a nuclear power plant is not inherently morally wrong. However, it could be considered unsafe if the dog is not under control or if the main character is in a restricted area where they should not be. In this case, the main character should follow the safety guidelines and rules at the nuclear power plant.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong",
