Their need to work together is often referred to as a(n)\n\nA. communal goal\nB. superordinate goal\nC. subordinate goal\nD. alliance formation\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. superordinate goal.\n\nA superordinate goal is a goal that is more important or higher-level than other goals, and is often pursued by individuals or groups who may not typically work together. In the context of the question, a mutual crisis can be seen as a superordinate goal because it is more important than the differences that the individuals may have had. The need to work together to achieve this goal can bring them closer and help them put aside their differences.",
