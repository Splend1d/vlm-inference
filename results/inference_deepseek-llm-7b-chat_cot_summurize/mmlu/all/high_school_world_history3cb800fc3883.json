An increased willingness to embrace radical Marxism\n\nassistant:The passage above is best seen as exemplifying option C: A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities.\n\nAlbert Camus' \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" is a philosophical work that grapples with the meaning of life and the absurdity of existence. In this passage, Camus is reflecting on the idea that there might be a meaning to life that transcends the human condition, and he acknowledges that he does not know this meaning and that it is impossible for him to know it just now. He also mentions that what meaning outside his condition could mean to him is beyond his understanding.\n\nThis passage reflects a modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities. Modernism, as a cultural and intellectual movement, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a reaction against the traditional values and beliefs of the past. Modernists were often skeptical of the authority of religious and philosophical traditions and sought to create new forms of art, literature, and thought that were free from the constraints of the past.\n\nIn the passage, Camus is grappling with the idea of a meaning that transcends the human condition, which could be seen as a challenge to the idea of a higher power or an ultimate purpose to life that is believed by many to be inherent in religious or traditional moral frameworks. By acknowledging that he does not know this meaning and that it is impossible for him to know it just now, Camus is expressing a modernist skepticism towards the idea of a transcendent meaning.\n\nFurthermore, Camus' statement that he can understand only in human terms and that what meaning outside his condition could mean to him is beyond his understanding, also reflects a modernist tendency to prioritize human experience and self-awareness over religious or traditional moral frameworks.\n\nTherefore, the passage is best seen as exemplifying a modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities.",
