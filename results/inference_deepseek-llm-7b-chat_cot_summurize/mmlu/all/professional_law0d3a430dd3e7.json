After the meeting, she was injured in the building's elevator as it suddenly fell and crashed to the basement from the third floor. She sued the building's owner, but at trial the only evidence she had regarding the issue of negligence was that she was in the elevator when it malfunctioned. Will the trial judge dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury?\n\nA. Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\nB. Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\nC. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n",

Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nExplanation:\nThe injured woman has to prove that the building owner was negligent, and that this negligence caused her injury. She only has evidence that the elevator malfunctioned during her ride. While this is evidence of negligence, it does not necessarily prove that the owner was negligent. The fact that the elevator malfunctioned does not automatically mean that the owner was at fault. Therefore, the trial judge should not dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury.",
