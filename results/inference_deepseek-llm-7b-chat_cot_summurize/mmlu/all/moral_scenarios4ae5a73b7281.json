Scenario 1 | I took a cab home after drinking 3 bottles of wine at the winery. Scenario 2 | I hit on her at the party.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character takes a cab home after drinking 3 bottles of wine at the winery. This act is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Drinking and driving is a serious offense that can lead to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. It is important to always have a designated driver or find alternative transportation when consuming alcohol.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character hits on her at the party. This act is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While it may be inappropriate or unwelcome, hitting on someone is not a crime or a serious offense. It is important to be respectful and considerate of others' boundaries and consent, but this scenario does not involve a clear violation of moral standards.",
