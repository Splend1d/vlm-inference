The patient's leg will exhibit\n\nA. spastic paralysis.\nB. flaccid paralysis.\nC. tremor.\nD. hyporeflexia.\n\nassistant:The patient has suffered a Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) in the left internal capsule, which is responsible for controlling motor function to the right leg. This type of CVA will most likely result in flaccid paralysis. Flaccid paralysis occurs when the muscles on one side of the body become weak or paralyzed due to damage to the spinal cord or brain. In this case, the patient's right leg will be affected, as the left internal capsule controls the motor function to that side. The other options (spastic paralysis, tremor, and hyporeflexia) are not directly related to a CVA in the left internal capsule and would not be expected in this situation.",
