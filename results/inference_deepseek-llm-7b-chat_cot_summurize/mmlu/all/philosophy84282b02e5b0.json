According to Hume, this moral sense is the foundation of our moral judgments and helps us navigate the complexities of human behavior. While reason may play a role in refining our moral judgments, it is not the primary source of our moral convictions. Emotion also influences our moral judgments, but Hume believes that this influence is secondary to the moral sense. The moral sense is universal in that it is shared by all members of our species, but it is still unique to each individual. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
