In this case, the syndrome is called Amniotic Band Syndrome.\n\nAmniotic Band Syndrome occurs when amniotic bands, which are thin strands of amniotic fluid that can form around a fetus during pregnancy, wrap around the fetus's limbs or body parts, causing damage to the tissue and organs. This can lead to various birth defects, including pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, and renal agenesis.\n\nTherefore, a baby born with pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to oligohydramnios caused by renal agenesis would be classified as having Amniotic Band Syndrome, which is a syndrome.",
