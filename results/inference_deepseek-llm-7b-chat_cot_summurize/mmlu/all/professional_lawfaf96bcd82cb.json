He intended to return the book after reading it. This statement would not provide a legitimate reason for his actions, and would only serve to further justify the law firm's claim that he committed larceny. The other options A, C, and D all provide valid reasons for the law student's actions, and could potentially help to mitigate the severity of his offense.",
