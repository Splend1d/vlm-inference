The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.\n\nAcre's tax basis in the land was $60,000, and they received a $100,000 fair market value when the partnership was formed. Therefore, the capital gain is $40,000 ($100,000 - $60,000). Acre is entitled to this entire gain, so they report a capital gain of $40,000.\n\nThe other two partners do not have a basis in the land, so they do not get to share in the gain. The remaining gain of $60,000 ($160,000 - $100,000) is allocated to Acre as their share of the partnership's profit.",
