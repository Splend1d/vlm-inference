Which of the following statements are correct?\n\n(i) The significance level is equal to the size of the test\n\n(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test\n\n(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test\n\n(iv) 5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\nB. (i) and (iii) only\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nExplanation:\n\n(i) The significance level is equal to the size of the test: This is true. The significance level, or alpha level, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The size of the test, or beta level, is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. The alpha and beta levels are related by the formula alpha + beta = 1.\n\n(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test: This is not necessarily true. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. These two concepts are related, but they are not the same.\n\n(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test: This is not necessarily true. In a 2-sided test, the rejection region extends to both tails of the distribution. Therefore, the proportion of the total distribution in each tail rejection region is 0.25, not 2.5%.\n\n(iv) 5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test: This is true. As mentioned above, in a 2-sided test, the rejection region extends to both tails of the distribution. Therefore, the proportion of the total distribution in each tail rejection region is 0.25, or 5%.",
