The electronic excitation energies of [Ru(H2O)6]2+, [Ru(CN)6]2- and [Ru(NH3)6]2+ are 18,900, 40,000 and 25,600 cm-1 respectively. Assuming that the chemical shift differences are dominated by paramagnetic currents, determine the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+.\n\nA. 7,530 ppm\nB. 8,090 ppm\nC. 11,070 ppm\nD. 14,840 ppm\n\nassistant:The chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ can be calculated using the relationship between the electronic excitation energies and the chemical shift of the complexes. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\u0394EShift = (Eexcitation_energy_of_complex1 - Eexcitation_energy_of_complex2) / (\u0394\u03bc - \u03bc0)\n\nwhere \u0394EShift is the chemical shift difference, Eexcitation_energy_of_complex1 and Eexcitation_energy_of_complex2 are the electronic excitation energies of the two complexes, and \u0394\u03bc is the difference in the chemical shift of the two complexes.\n\nGiven the values provided, we have:\n\n\u0394EShift = (18900 - 40000) / (16050 - 0) = -22100 / 16050 = 1.378\n\nThe difference in chemical shift for [Ru(NH3)6]2+ and [Ru(CN)6]2- is 1.378. Now, we need to find the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+. Since we have the chemical shift of [Ru(CN)6]2- at 0 ppm, we can use the relationship:\n\n\u0394\u03bc = \u0394EShift / (1 + 1 / (\u0394EShift * (1 + 1 / \u0394EShift)))\n\n\u0394\u03bc = 1.378 / (1 + 1 / 1.378) = 1.378 / (1 + 1/1.378) = 0 ppm\n\nTherefore, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is 0 ppm.\n\nHowever, the given options do not include 0 ppm, so we need to find the closest option. According to the relationship between the electronic excitation energies and the chemical shift, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ should be higher than [Ru(CN)6]2-. Therefore, the closest option to 0 ppm is A. 7,530 ppm.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 7,530 ppm.",
