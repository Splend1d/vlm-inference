Aurignacian\nB. Acheulean\nC. Mousterian\nD. both b and c\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Both B and C.\n\nThe Mousterian and Acheulean tool technologies are associated with anatomically modern Homo sapiens. The Mousterian is a Stone Age archaeological culture that was developed by early modern humans and is characterized by the use of hand-axes and cleavers. The Acheulean is a stone tool tradition associated with early humans that is characterized by the use of large stone tools, such as hand axes and cleavers. Both of these tool technologies are associated with anatomically modern Homo sapiens.\n\nThe Aurignacian is a later Stone Age culture that is associated with the Upper Paleolithic period and is characterized by the use of bone tools and the development of fine-pointed stone tools such as spear points and arrowheads. The Acheulian is a precursor to the Acheulean and is associated with the Lower Paleolithic period.\n\nIt is important to note that the Mousterian and Acheulean tool technologies are associated with early modern humans, who are the direct ancestors of anatomically modern humans.",
