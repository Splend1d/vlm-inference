Childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects short term cognitive performance\nB. Childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects long term cognitive performance\nC. Neither of the statements are correct\nD. Both of the statements are correct\n\nassistant:D. Both of the statements are correct.\n\nChildhood stunting before 24 months of age can have a significant impact on a child's cognitive development, affecting both short-term and long-term cognitive performance. In fact, stunted children are more likely to experience learning difficulties, reduced academic performance, and lower cognitive abilities.\n\nStunting is a condition where a child's growth is restricted due to chronic undernutrition during critical periods, especially in the first 1,000 days from conception to the child's second birthday. During this period, the brain undergoes rapid development, and any nutritional deficiencies can have lasting effects on the child's cognitive, motor, and social-emotional development.\n\nShort-term cognitive performance refers to the child's ability to learn, remember, and apply information in the present context. Stunted children may experience difficulties in this area due to impaired attention, memory, and problem-solving skills.\n\nLong-term cognitive performance, on the other hand, refers to the child's ability to acquire and apply knowledge over a longer period. Stunted children may have reduced intellectual capacity, which can hinder their ability to learn new information and skills, and may result in lower academic achievement and employment opportunities.\n\nIn summary, both statements are correct. Childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects short-term and long-term cognitive performance, impacting a child's overall development and future prospects.",
