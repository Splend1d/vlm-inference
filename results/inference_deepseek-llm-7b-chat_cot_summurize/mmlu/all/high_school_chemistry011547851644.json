You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: What is the work involved if a gas in a 2.0-liter container at 2.4 atmospheres pressure is allowed to expand against a pressure of 0.80 atmosphere?\n\nA. -3.2 L atm\nB. -9.62 L atm\nC. -4.8 L atm\nD. +14.4 L atm\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the change in volume of a gas: V_final - V_initial = n * R * (P_final / P_initial), where V_final is the final volume, V_initial is the initial volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and P_final and P_initial are the final and initial pressures, respectively.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of gas in the 2.0-liter container at 2.4 atmospheres pressure. We can use the ideal gas law, which states that P * V = n * R * T, where T is the temperature. We are not given the temperature, so we can use the fact that P_initial = 2.4 atm and P_final = 0.80 atm to find the change in volume.\n\nV_initial = (P_final * V_final) / P_initial\nV_initial = (0.80 atm * 2.0 L) / 2.4 atm\nV_initial = 1.0 L\n\nNow we can find the change in volume when the gas is allowed to expand:\n\nV_final - V_initial = n * R * (P_final / P_initial)\n0.0 L - 1.0 L = n * R * (0.80 atm / 2.4 atm)\n-1.0 L = n * R * (0.375)\n\nWe know that R = 8.314 J/mol*K, so we can find the number of moles of gas:\n\n-1.0 L = n * 8.314 J/mol*K * 0.375\n-4.157 = n * 8.314 * 0.375\nn = -4.157 / (8.314 * 0.375)\nn = -0.5\n\nNow we can find the change in volume:\n\n-1.0 L = (-0.5 mol) * 8.314 J/mol*K * 0.375\n-1.0 L = -0.9518 J/mol*K * 0.375\n-1.0 L = -0.3335 J/mol*K\n\nFinally, we can convert this change in volume to L atm:\n\n-3.2 L atm\n\nThe answer is A. -3.2 L atm.",
