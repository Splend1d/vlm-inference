Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytoplasm of cells, where it converts glucose into pyruvate molecules. The process is initiated by the enzyme hexokinase, which is located in the cytoplasm. Other enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, are also present in the cytoplasm.",
