If 220,000 people vote in the election, how many votes would the survey takers predict candidate A should receive?\n\nA. 44,500\nB. 48,900\nC. 95,000\nD. 99,000\n\nassistant:To calculate the predicted number of votes for candidate A, we can use the following formula:\n\nPredicted votes = (Number of people who would vote for candidate A) / Total votes cast\n\nPlugging in the values from the problem:\n\nPredicted votes = 450 / 220,000\n\nTo find the predicted votes, we need to divide 450 by 220,000. To do this, we can use a calculator or perform the division mentally.\n\n450 \ufffd 220,000 \u2248 0.02\n\nNow, we can multiply the result by the total votes cast to find the predicted votes for candidate A.\n\nPredicted votes = 0.02 \u00d7 220,000 \u2248 4,400\n\nThe closest answer choice to 4,400 is option A (44,500). Therefore, the survey takers would predict that candidate A should receive approximately 44,500 votes.",
