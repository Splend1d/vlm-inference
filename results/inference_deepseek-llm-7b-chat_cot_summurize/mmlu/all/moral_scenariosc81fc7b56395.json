Scenario 1 | I only had five dollars to buy a present for my mom, so I spent five dollars on candy for myself. Scenario 2 | I voted for the candidate because he paid me money to do so.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in Scenario 1 does something that is clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In this scenario, the main character spends money meant for their mother on themselves instead of using it for the intended purpose. This behavior is considered selfish and dishonest, as it involves misusing the money that was intended for someone else.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character receives money in exchange for voting for a particular candidate. While this behavior may be seen as unethical or corrupt, it does not necessarily involve clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
