This statute allows for the right to choose abortion during the first trimester, while also imposing restrictions on the right to obtain an abortion after the first trimester to protect the life and health of the woman. This balance is considered constitutional as it respects both the woman's right to choose and the unborn child's right to life, while also taking into account the state's interest in protecting the health and life of the mother.",
