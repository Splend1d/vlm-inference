To measure galactic distances.\n\nCepheid stars are relevant for astronomers because they are used to measure galactic distances. These stars exhibit a period-luminosity relationship, meaning that their brightness and pulsation period are directly related. By observing the brightness of a Cepheid star and its pulsation period, astronomers can calculate its distance from Earth. This method is called the \"Cepheid variable method\" and has proven to be an effective way to measure distances in galaxies, including our own Milky Way.\n\nA. Measuring interstellar mass is not specific to Cepheid stars. Other types of stars and methods, such as brown dwarfs or the H I 21 cm line, can also be used for this purpose.\n\nC. Measuring galactic energy-density is not directly related to Cepheid stars. While Cepheids can provide information about the overall energy output of a galaxy, the energy density would need to be calculated based on other data, such as the distribution of stars and gas.\n\nD. Measuring interstellar density is not specific to Cepheid stars. Other types of stars and methods, such as H II regions or molecular clouds, can also be used for this purpose.",
