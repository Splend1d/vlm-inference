Although his previous antigovernment protest rallies attracted fewer than 15 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit pursuant to the city ordinance. After meeting with the anarchist, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. On October 4, the anarchist and his fellow demonstrators staged their antigovemment protest at a city park. The rally attracted only about 17 protestors and was conducted peacefully. As the anarchist was making his final remarks to the gathering, the city police arrived at the park and arrested him and his fellow demonstrators, charging them with violating the city ordinance.

The ordinance targets a specific type of speech (antigovernment protest demonstrations) and imposes a substantial restriction on it. The content-based nature of the ordinance is evident in the fact that it requires a permit for meetings of 50 or more people and imposes a fee based on the number of hours the meeting lasts. This type of regulation would be unconstitutional under the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the right to free speech.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. unconstitutional, because the statute is a content-based regulation of speech.",
