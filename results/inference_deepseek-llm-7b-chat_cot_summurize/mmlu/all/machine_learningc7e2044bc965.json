False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nThis statement is true. Linear regression estimators are known for having a small variance, making them a popular choice for predicting continuous variables. The variance is a measure of the dispersion of the estimator.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nThis statement is false. In AdaBoost, the coefficients \u03b1 are assigned to the classifiers based on their performance in classifying the training data. Sometimes, the classifiers may have negative coefficients. For example, if a classifier is extremely poor at predicting the class, it may have a large negative coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
