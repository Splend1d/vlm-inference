She was carrying a purse and shopping bags. A police officer noticed her and, on a hunch, conducted a random search. He found a variety of jewelry with price tags and no receipts.

No, the search was legal because a teenager carrying bags on a downtown street is a suspicious person.\nD. Yes, the officer did not get a search warrant even though he had probable cause.\n\nassistant:The answer is D. The officer did not get a search warrant even though he had probable cause.\n\nIn this situation, the police officer conducted a random search of the teenage girl without any reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. A search is considered reasonable if the police have a reasonable suspicion that the individual being searched has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. In this case, the officer did not have any reason to suspect that the girl had committed a crime or was about to commit one.\n\nAdditionally, a search is only considered reasonable if the police have probable cause to believe that the individual being searched has evidence of a crime. In this case, the jewelry found in the girl's possession was stolen from a nearby jewelry store, but the officer did not have any information that directly linked the girl to the crime.\n\nTherefore, the judge is likely to order the suppression of the evidence, as the officer did not have either reasonable suspicion or probable cause to conduct the search.",
