The leaves of an oak tree and the spines of a cactus\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird.\n\nConvergent evolution is a phenomenon in which unrelated species independently evolve similar traits or features due to similar selective pressures in their environments. In this case, the wings of an insect and the wings of a bird are both adaptations for flight, but they originated independently through convergent evolution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the pectoral fins of fish and the front legs of cats have different functions and origins. Option B is incorrect because the presence of a notochord in all chordate embryos is a feature shared by all chordates, not a result of convergent evolution. Option D is incorrect because the leaves of an oak tree and the spines of a cactus have different functions and origins.",
