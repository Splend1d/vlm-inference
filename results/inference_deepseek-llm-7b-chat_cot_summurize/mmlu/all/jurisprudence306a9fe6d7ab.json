You must not consciously harm another person.\nB. You must always act in the best interests of the community.\nC. You must treat human beings as means rather than ends.\nD. You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.\n\nassistant:The 'categorical imperative' is a concept in philosophy, specifically in the work of Immanuel Kant. It is a moral principle that states that one should act in a way that, if their actions were to become a universal law, they would be willing for everyone to follow that law.\n\nIn other words, the categorical imperative is a way of determining what is morally right by considering how our actions would affect everyone, not just ourselves.\n\nTo put it simply, the categorical imperative can be summarized by the phrase \"Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is D. You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.",
