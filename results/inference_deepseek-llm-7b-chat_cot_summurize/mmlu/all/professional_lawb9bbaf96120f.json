Last January, the man slipped and fell while restocking grocery shelves at work. The man is suing the grocery store for damages, claiming that he suffers from pain in his back and legs as a result of the accident. At trial, the woman testified that five days prior to the accident, the man told her, \"I can't complete the tennis match because of pains in my back and legs. \"The trial judge should rule this testimony\n\nA. inadmissible as hearsay.\nB. inadmissible as opinion testimony.\nC. admissible as a proper lay opinion.\nD. admissible as a statement of bodily condition.\n\nassistant:D. admissible as a statement of bodily condition.\n\nThe man's testimony about his back and leg pain is not hearsay because it is a statement of his own bodily condition. Hearsay is a statement made by someone other than the declarant (the person making the statement) and offered in court for the truth of the matter asserted. Since the man is the one who is suffering from the pain, his testimony is not hearsay.\n\nAs for option B, it is not inadmissible as opinion testimony. The woman is testifying as a layperson, and her opinion about the man's pain is relevant to the case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the woman's testimony is not considered a proper lay opinion. Lay opinion refers to the testimony of an ordinary, nonspecialized witness who offers an opinion based on personal knowledge or general knowledge. The woman is the man's tennis partner, not a medical professional, so her testimony is not considered a proper lay opinion.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because the man's testimony is not inadmissible as hearsay. As previously explained, the man is testifying about his own bodily condition, which is not hearsay.",
