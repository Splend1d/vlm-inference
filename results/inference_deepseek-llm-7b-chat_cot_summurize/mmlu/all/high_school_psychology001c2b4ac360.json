These receptors send information to the brain about the position and movement of different parts of the body. This information is important for maintaining balance and coordination, as well as for performing various movements and activities.\n\nThe cochlea of the ear is responsible for hearing, and does not have any direct connection to gravity sensing. The macula of the eye is responsible for vision, and also does not have any direct connection to gravity sensing. The olfactory mucosa is responsible for the sense of smell, and does not have any direct connection to gravity sensing.",
