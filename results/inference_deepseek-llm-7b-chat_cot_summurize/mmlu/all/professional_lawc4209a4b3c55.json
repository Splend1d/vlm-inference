A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance.

In this case, the search was conducted by a private party (the counselor) and not by a law enforcement officer with a warrant. Therefore, the search was unreasonable and violated the student's Fourth Amendment rights. The court is likely to suppress the evidence and dismiss the charges against the student. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. The motion is not likely to be granted because the officer did not open the envelope until they arrived at the police station, after the envelope had been transported from the school by the officer.\nC. The motion is not likely to be granted because the search was conducted by a private party who was on school property and had a legitimate reason for being there (working on a research project).\nD. The motion is not likely to be granted because the counselor was not acting in loco parentis, but rather was working on a research project and not supervising or caring for the student.",
