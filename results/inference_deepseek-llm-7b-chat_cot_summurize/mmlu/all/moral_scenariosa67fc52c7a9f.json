In Scenario 1, the main character spits on a cake, which is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, the main character is being careful not to overfeed the baby, which is not morally wrong. Therefore, the first scenario is wrong, and the second scenario is not wrong. So the answer is Wrong, Not wrong.",
