The use of the tracking device without a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Therefore, the evidence obtained through the tracking device, including the information used to obtain the search warrant, may not be used in court. The other options are incorrect because they do not address the issue of the tracking device being used without a warrant.",
