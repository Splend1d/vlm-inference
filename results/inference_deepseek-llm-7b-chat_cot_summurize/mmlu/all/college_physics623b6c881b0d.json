If the voltage across the resistor is doubled, what will be the new rate of energy dissipation?\n\nA. 0.25 W\nB. 0.5 W\nC. 1 W\nD. 4 W\n\nassistant:Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to find the power (P) dissipated by the resistor. Since power is the product of voltage (V) and current (I), we can write the equation as:\n\nP = V \\* I\n\n2. The initial voltage is 1 Volt and the power dissipation is 1 Watt.\n\nP_initial = 1 V \\* I_initial = 1 W\n\n3. Now, we need to find the new voltage. Since the voltage is doubled, the new voltage is:\n\nV_new = 2 \\* V_initial\n\n4. Now, we can find the new power dissipation:\n\nP_new = V_new \\* I_new\n\n5. To find I_new, we can use Ohm's Law:\n\nI_new = P_new / (V_new \\* R)\n\nwhere R is the resistance of the resistor.\n\n6. We know the initial power dissipation (P_initial = 1 W), and we can assume that the resistance of the resistor remains constant. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\nI_new = (1 W) / (2 V_initial \\* R)\n\n7. Now, we can find I_new:\n\nI_new = 1 / (2 \\* 1 \\* R) = R / 2\n\n8. Now, we can find the new power dissipation:\n\nP_new = V_new \\* I_new = (2 \\* 1) \\* (R / 2) = R\n\n9. The question asks for the new rate of energy dissipation, which is the new power dissipation. So, the answer is:\n\nP_new = R\n\nThe correct answer is D. 4 W.",
