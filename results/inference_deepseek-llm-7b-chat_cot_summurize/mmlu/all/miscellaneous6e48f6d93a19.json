Ensuring company compliance with laws and regulations\n\nIf a human resources manager does not perform their responsibility of ensuring company compliance with laws and regulations correctly, it could lead to legal issues for the company. This could result in fines, penalties, or even lawsuits, which would have a significant negative impact on the company's finances, reputation, and operations.\n\nRecruiting and hiring new employees is important for maintaining a healthy and productive workforce, but if done incorrectly, it may lead to ineffective hires or legal issues. Providing professional development opportunities for employees can improve employee satisfaction and productivity, but if done incorrectly, it may not have a significant negative impact on the company. Filing employee compensation and benefits forms is important for ensuring that employees are paid correctly and receive their benefits, but if done incorrectly, it may lead to errors or delays in compensation, which can affect employee morale and productivity.",
