True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1 is false. SVM learning algorithm does not guarantee to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its object function. It is only guaranteed to find a local minimum of the objective function.\n\nStatement 2 is true. After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space. The kernel function can expand the dimensionality of the input space, allowing the Perceptron to learn more complex patterns. However, we cannot guarantee that the Perceptron will achieve better performance, as it depends on the specific problem and the choice of kernel function.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.
