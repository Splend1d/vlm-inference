Scenario 1 | I lost my legs while serving in Iraq so I parked in the handicap parking spot. Scenario 2 | The hospital signs told us to turn off all electrical devices, but I kept my phone on.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character is parking in a handicap parking spot because they lost their legs while serving in Iraq. This is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. People with disabilities are allowed to park in handicap parking spots to make it easier for them to access buildings and facilities.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is keeping their phone on while following the hospital signs that tell them to turn off all electrical devices. While it might be considered rude or disrespectful to the hospital's rules, it is not morally wrong. The hospital's rules are meant to prevent interference with medical equipment, not to punish people for having phones on.",
