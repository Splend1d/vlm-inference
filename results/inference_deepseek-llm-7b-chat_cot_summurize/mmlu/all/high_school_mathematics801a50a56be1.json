The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?\n\nA. 396\nB. 72\nC. 66\nD. 36\n\nassistant:Let's denote the number of original pins as P.\n\nAccording to the problem, John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles, and the two piles had an equal number of pins. This means that each pile has P/2 pins.\n\nNext, we are told that he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. One-third of one pile is (1/3) * (P/2) = P/6.\n\nSo, he gave his brother P/6 pins.\n\nAfter giving his brother some pins, John had 66 pins left. Therefore, P - (P/6) = 66.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 5P/6 = 66.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6/5, we get: P = 99.\n\nHowever, this answer is not among the given options. There might be an error in the problem statement or the given options.",
