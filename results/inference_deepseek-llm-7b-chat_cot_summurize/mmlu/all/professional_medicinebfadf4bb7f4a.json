Olfactory nerve\n\nassistant:The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is the Olfactory nerve (D). The patient has symptoms of meningitis, which is an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The infection most likely entered the patient's central nervous system through the olfactory nerve, which carries sensory information from the nose to the brain. The other options listed (Facial nerve, Frontal sinus, and Mastoid sinus) are not likely portals of entry for a meningitis infection.",
