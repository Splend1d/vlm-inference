The Letter Agreement in this case contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, including the price, down payment amount, financing terms, and assets to be included. While the final closing date was not specified, this does not negate the binding nature of the agreement. The fact that the down payment was made and the letter stated that it comprised the essential agreement further supports the enforceability of the contract.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. Because the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract, and the appellate court is likely to affirm the lower court's decision.",
