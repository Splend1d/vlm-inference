One of the waves has an amplitude of 4 cm.\n3. The other wave has an amplitude of 6 cm.\n\nWhen two waves of equal frequency are superposed, the resulting wave has an amplitude equal to the sum of the individual amplitudes and a phase difference equal to the difference between the initial phases of the waves.\n\nGiven the amplitude of the first wave is 4 cm and the amplitude of the second wave is 6 cm, the sum of their amplitudes is 4 + 6 = 10 cm.\n\nNow let's determine the phase difference between the waves. Since the question does not provide information about the initial phases, we can assume that the waves have the same phase difference.\n\nTherefore, the resulting wave has an amplitude of 10 cm and a phase difference of 0 degrees.\n\nThe displacement of the resultant wave, D, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = A * sin(k * x - \u03c6)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, x is the position along the wave, and \u03c6 is the phase difference.\n\nSince we know the amplitude is 10 cm and the phase difference is 0 degrees, we can write:\n\nD = 10 * sin(k * x)\n\nNow we can substitute the given wave number, k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength:\n\nD = 10 * sin(2\u03c0x/\u03bb)\n\nSince the waves are traveling in the same direction, the phase difference between them is 0 degrees. Therefore, the sine term becomes:\n\nsin(\u03c6) = sin(0) = 0\n\nThis means that the displacement of the resultant wave, D, is 0 at all positions along the wave.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 10 cm \u2264 D \u2264 12 cm",
