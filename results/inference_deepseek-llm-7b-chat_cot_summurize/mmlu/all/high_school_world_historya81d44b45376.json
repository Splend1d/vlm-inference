Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n\nassistant:The question is asking for a treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. as described in the passage from Germania by Tacitus.\n\nOption A is not a similar treatment because in the period 600\u20131450 C.E., barbarian peoples were not generally converted to the religions of their host societies.\n\nOption B is not a similar treatment because in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., barbarian peoples were not generally utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n\nOption D is not a similar treatment because in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., barbarian peoples were not often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n\nOption C is a similar treatment. In the passage from Germania, the treatment of the Tencteri, Bructeri, Chamavi, and Angrivarii by the neighboring tribes and the Roman Empire is described. The neighboring tribes drove the Tencteri and Bructeri out of their settlements and \"utterly exterminated\" them, and the Roman Empire did the same. In the period 600\u20131450 C.E., barbarian peoples were often relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies, similar to the treatment of the Tencteri, Bructeri, Chamavi, and Angrivarii by their neighboring tribes and the Roman Empire.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.",
