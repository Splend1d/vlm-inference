If her reading rate remains the same, which method could be used to determine the number of minutes for her to read 18 pages?\n\nA. add 18 and 3\nB. divide 18 by 3\nC. multiply 3 by 18\nD. subtract 3 from 18\n\nassistant:To determine the number of minutes it would take Susan to read 18 pages, if her reading rate remains the same, we can use the method described in option B. We can use the formula:\n\nnumber of minutes = (number of pages) / (reading rate)\n\nIn this case, the number of pages is 18 and the reading rate is 1 page per 3 minutes. So the formula would look like this:\n\nnumber of minutes = 18 / 3\n\nNow we can solve for the number of minutes:\n\nnumber of minutes = 6\n\nTherefore, Susan would take 6 minutes to read 18 pages if her reading rate remains the same.\n\nThe correct answer is option B.",
