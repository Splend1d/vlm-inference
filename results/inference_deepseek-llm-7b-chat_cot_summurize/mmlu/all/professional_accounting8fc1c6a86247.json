You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A $500 par-value convertible debenture is selling at $520. If the conversion ratio is 20, what is the conversion price?\n\nA. $19.23\nB. $20.18\nC. $25.00\nD. $26.00\n\nassistant:To find the conversion price, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of shares that can be obtained by investing the face value of the convertible debenture (i.e., $500).\n2. Divide the conversion price by the total number of shares obtained.\n\nStep 1:\nThe user provided a convertible debenture selling at $520, and the conversion ratio is 20. To find the total number of shares that can be obtained, we can multiply the face value of the convertible debenture by the conversion ratio:\n\nNumber of shares = Face value \u00d7 Conversion ratio\nNumber of shares = $500 \u00d7 20\nNumber of shares = $10,000\n\nStep 2:\nNow, we need to find the conversion price by dividing the total number of shares by the total number of convertible debentures:\n\nConversion price = Number of shares / Total number of convertible debentures\nConversion price = $10,000 / 1\nConversion price = $10,000\n\nThe conversion price is $10,000.
