It is similar to the hydrogen atom, with the positron replacing the proton. If a positronium atom makes a transition from the state with n=3 to a state with n=1, the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to\n\nA. 6.0 e\nB. 6.8 eV\nC. 12.2 eV\nD. 13.6 eV\n\nassistant:The energy of a photon emitted in a transition between the states n=3 and n=1 in a positronium atom can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = (n^2 - n_1^2) * hc / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the photon, n is the initial energy level (n=3), n_1 is the final energy level (n=1), h is the Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and m_e is the mass of an electron.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = (3^2 - 1^2) * hc / (2 * m_e)\nE = (9 - 1) * 6.626 x 10^-34 J * 3 x 10^8 m/s / (2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\nE = 3.6 x 10^-19 J\n\nThe answer is 3.6 x 10^-19 J, which is approximately 6.0 e. So, the closest answer is A. 6.0 e.",
