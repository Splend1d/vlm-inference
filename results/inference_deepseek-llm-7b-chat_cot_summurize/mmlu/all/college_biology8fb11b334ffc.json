Lekking behavior.\n\nNatural enemies have been implicated as a strong selective force for aposematic coloration (A) and chemical defenses (B), as these traits are selected for because they help individuals avoid predation. Masting (synchronous fruiting) (C) is a reproductive strategy that is also influenced by natural enemies, but it is not the focus of this question.\n\nLekking behavior (D) refers to the mating behavior of some bird species, where males gather at a lek and compete for access to females. While natural enemies can influence the evolution of lekking behavior, it is not the main selective force for this behavior. Instead, competition among males for access to females is the primary selective force for lekking behavior.",
