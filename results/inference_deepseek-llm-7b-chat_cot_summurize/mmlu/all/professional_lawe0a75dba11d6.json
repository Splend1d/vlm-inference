This is because the rancher had reasonable grounds to believe that the orange grove belonged to a private person, which would give him the right to make an emergency landing there. Additionally, the rancher was carefully and skillfully operating his airplane when the engine went out, which further supports his claim that he had no intention of causing harm to the orange grove or its owner.",
