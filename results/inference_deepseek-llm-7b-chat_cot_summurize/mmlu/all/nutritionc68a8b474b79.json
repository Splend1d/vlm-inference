Long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development caused the spike.\nB. The use of food crops to produce biofuel caused food prices to rise.\nC. It was caused by commodity price speculation.\nD. All of the above were among the causes.\n\nassistant:The food-price spike of 2007-2008 was caused by a combination of factors, including long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development, the use of food crops to produce biofuel, and commodity price speculation.\n\nLong-term neglect of agricultural and rural development had led to a decline in food production and an increase in food prices. The biofuel industry also contributed to the spike, as the demand for food crops to produce biofuel increased and drove up the prices of those crops. Finally, commodity price speculation played a role, as investors bought up food commodities in anticipation of future price increases.\n\nOverall, a combination of these factors contributed to the food-price spike of 2007-2008.",
