In multiparty systems, such as those in England and Israel, political parties have distinct ideologies and often compete with one another on specific policy issues. In contrast, in the United States, political parties are often more moderate and may not have as clearly defined ideologies. This can make it difficult for the parties to clearly communicate their goals and values to the public.",
