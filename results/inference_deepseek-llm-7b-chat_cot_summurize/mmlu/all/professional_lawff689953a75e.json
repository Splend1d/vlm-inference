In order for a search to be reasonable, the police must have a warrant issued by a judge. If the police did not have a warrant when they searched the bookstore, then the search would have been unreasonable, and the evidence they found (the magazines) would not be admissible in court.\n\nIf the owner can establish that the police did not have a warrant, it would likely lead to the dismissal of the charges against him.",
