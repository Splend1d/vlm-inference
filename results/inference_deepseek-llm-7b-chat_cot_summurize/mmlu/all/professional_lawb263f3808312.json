To aid in his study of sharks, he had a large tank built in his backyard in which he placed a great white shark.

In order to convince his neighbors that they had nothing to fear, the resident invited them over to view the shark tank.

The resident is considered the possessor of the wild animal (the great white shark) and is therefore strictly liable for any injuries it causes.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the neighbor did not base her suit on the smell from the tank being a nuisance.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the neighbor did not suffer an injury that was not normally inflicted by a shark. Being splashed by a shark is a foreseeable risk associated with keeping one as a pet.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is irrelevant that the neighbor had a cold. The fact that she was unusually vulnerable to harm does not absolve the resident of liability for the injury caused by the shark.",
