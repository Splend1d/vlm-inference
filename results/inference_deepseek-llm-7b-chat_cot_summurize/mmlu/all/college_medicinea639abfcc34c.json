Paranoid\nD. Obsessive-compulsive\n\nassistant:The patient's behavior is most consistent with a Narcissistic personality disorder. Narcissists often have a grandiose sense of their own importance, a deep need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. In this case, the patient's belief that his time is worth more than others and his anger at being treated by a dental hygienist rather than the dentist himself are both indicative of this disorder.",
