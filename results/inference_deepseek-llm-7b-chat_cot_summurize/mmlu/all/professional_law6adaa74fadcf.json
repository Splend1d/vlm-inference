Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\nThe neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This easement remains valid and binding on the woman, even though the woman has now erected a solar collector on the land subject to the easement. The woman cannot unilaterally modify the terms of the easement by erecting the solar collector, as this would effectively prevent the neighbor from using the easement. Therefore, the solar collector must be removed to restore the neighbor's access to the public highway.\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access: This is not a valid defense, as the easement is still valid and binding on the woman.\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors: While the local zoning code does permit the use of solar collectors, this does not excuse the woman from complying with the terms of the easement.\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources: This is not a valid defense, as the easement remains valid and binding on the woman.",
