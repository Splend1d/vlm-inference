What is the flow speed at another point in this pipe, where the diameter is 3 cm?\n\nA. 4 m/s\nB. 6 m/s\nC. 8 m/s\nD. 12 m/s\n\nassistant:Let's use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which relates the flow rate (Q) to the pressure difference (\u0394P), the radius (r), and the length (L) of the pipe:\n\nQ = (\u03c0 * \u0394P * r^4) / (8 * L)\n\nWe know that the flow speed (v) is related to the flow rate (Q) by:\n\nv = Q / A\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe.\n\nFor a pipe with a circular cross-section, the area is given by:\n\nA = \u03c0 * r^2\n\nNow, we can solve for the flow speed at the point with a diameter of 3 cm.\n\nGiven:\nDiameter at point 1 = 2 cm = 0.02 m\nFlow speed at point 1 = 18 m/s\n\nDiameter at point 2 = 3 cm = 0.03 m\n\nFirst, let's find the flow rate at point 1.\n\nUsing the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we get:\n\nQ1 = (\u03c0 * \u0394P1 * (0.02)^4) / (8 * L1)\n\nWe don't have the pressure difference (\u0394P1) or the length (L1) for point 1, but we know that the flow rate is constant. So, we can set the flow rate at point 1 equal to the flow speed at point 1:\n\n18 m/s = Q1\n\nNow, we can find the pressure difference (\u0394P1) using the continuity equation:\n\n\u0394P1 = \u0394P2\n\nSince the flow rate is constant, we have:\n\nQ1 = Q2\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values and solve for \u0394P1:\n\n18 m/s = (\u03c0 * \u0394P1 * (0.02)^4) / (8 * L1)\n\n\u0394P1 = (18 m/s * 8 * L1) / (\u03c0 * (0.02)^4)\n\nNow, we can use the continuity equation to find \u0394P2:\n\n\u0394P1 = \u0394P2\n\n\u0394P2 = (18 m/s * 8 * L1) / (\u03c0 * (0.03)^4)\n\nNow, we can find the flow speed at point 2:\n\nv2 = Q2 * A2 / (2 * \u03c0 * r1^2)\n\nSince the flow rate is constant:\n\nQ2 = Q1 = 18 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the flow speed at point 2:\n\nv2 = 18 m/s * \u03c0 * (0.03)^2 / (2 * (0.02)^2)\n\nv2 \u2248 12 m/s\n\nSo, the flow speed at the point with a diameter of 3 cm is approximately 12 m/s. The correct answer is D. 12 m/s.",
