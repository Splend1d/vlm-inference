During intense exercise, the body's oxygen supply becomes limited, which can lead to a decrease in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy source for the muscles. Phosphocreatine is used to regenerate ATP during exercise, and its resynthesis is critical for muscle recovery. A lack of oxygen can prevent the efficient resynthesis of phosphocreatine, leading to muscle fatigue and delayed recovery.",
