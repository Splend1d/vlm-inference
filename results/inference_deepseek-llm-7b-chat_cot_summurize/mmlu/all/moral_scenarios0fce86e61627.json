Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is a hospital care center worker who gave opioids to a patient. This action is morally ambiguous and could be seen as wrong or necessary depending on the circumstances.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is not doing anything morally wrong by not bringing their knife on a plane. They simply followed the rules set by the airline. There is no clear moral wrongdoing in this scenario.",
