Which of the following methods would be best suited to measurement of trace amounts (sub-ppb) of CFCs in an air sample?\n\nA. Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by electron capture detection\nB. Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a packed column followed by thermal conductivity detection\nC. Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by flame ionization detection\nD. Conversion of the sample of the chlorinated compounds to chloride ions, followed by titration with Ag+\n\nassistant:The best method to measure trace amounts of CFCs in an air sample is A. Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by electron capture detection.\n\nJustification: Electron capture detection is a sensitive and selective technique that can detect CFCs with low concentrations in the air sample. This method can accurately measure the amount of CFCs present in the sample, making it the best choice for the given task.",
