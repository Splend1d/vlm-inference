The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\n\nassistant:The most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge would be the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is because the tax imposed on nonresident photographers who operate studios in the state discriminates against them based on their residency status, which may violate the equal protection clause. The other options, such as the due process clause and the commerce clause, do not directly apply to this situation. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV is also not applicable in this case.",
