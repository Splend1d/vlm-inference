Alpha-thalassaemia\n\nSevere anaemia at birth is a feature of alpha-thalassaemia, which is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. In alpha-thalassaemia, the haemoglobin protein is either missing or is missing a crucial amino acid, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood. This can result in severe anaemia and other complications, particularly in the liver and spleen.",
