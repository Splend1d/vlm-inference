God demands that all sexual activity occur in the context of marriage.\nB. this will ultimately produce the most happiness for the greatest number of persons.\nC. in marriage two persons equally and reciprocally transfer their whole person to the other.\nD. the universal law formulation of the categorical imperative requires that each of us be married.\n\nassistant:Kant's views on marriage and sexuality are primarily centered around the idea that marriage is a moral institution that allows individuals to treat each other with respect and dignity. According to Kant, in marriage, spouses are not merely means to an end, but rather ends in themselves. This means that they are treated as ends in themselves, rather than simply as means to achieve other goals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. in marriage two persons equally and reciprocally transfer their whole person to the other.\n\nThis view aligns with Kant's ethical philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of treating individuals as ends in themselves, rather than as means to an end. By transferring their whole person to each other in marriage, spouses are able to engage in sexual activity without treating each other as mere means to their own pleasure or satisfaction. Instead, they are able to view each other as ends in themselves, and respect and value each other as individuals.",
