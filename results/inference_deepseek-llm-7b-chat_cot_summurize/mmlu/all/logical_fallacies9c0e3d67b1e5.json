In this scenario, the person is making a claim that doing something will lead to extreme consequences without providing any evidence or cause and effect relationship between the act and those consequences. This can create a slippery slope argument, where one action leads to another and another, ultimately leading to a negative outcome that the person is warning against. This type of argument can be seen as a form of exaggeration or alarmism, as it may not necessarily lead to the extreme consequences that the person is claiming.",
