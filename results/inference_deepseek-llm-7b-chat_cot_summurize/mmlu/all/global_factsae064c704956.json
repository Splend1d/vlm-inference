However, it's important to note that this percentage may have changed since then.\n\nIn recent years, there have been significant changes in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights in Brazil. In 2013, Brazil became the first Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage, and in 2018, it was the first country in the region to legalize same-sex adoption.\n\nIt's also worth noting that attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights in Brazil are not evenly distributed across the country. In the case of same-sex marriage, for example, the country is divided on the issue. In 2016, a controversial law was passed that criminalized gay marriage in the country's 26 states that did not already allow it. The law was later overturned by the Supreme Court, which ruled that it violated the constitution.\n\nOverall, it's clear that attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights in Brazil are evolving, and while there is still work to be done, there have been important gains in recent years.",
