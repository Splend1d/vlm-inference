Synthesis of ATP\nB. Reduction of NADP+ to NADPH\nC. Release of O2\nD. Reduction of CO2 to sugar\n\nassistant:When electrons flow cyclically through the electron transport chain associated with photosystem I in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells, the following occurs:\n\nB. Reduction of NADP+ to NADPH.\n\nThis process is known as the light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis, and it is responsible for generating the energy required to power the light-independent reaction, or the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reaction, photons of light are absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in the thylakoid membrane, causing electrons to be excited and transferred through a series of protein complexes called photosystems. As the electrons flow through the electron transport chain, they lose energy, which is used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. This molecule plays a crucial role in the Calvin cycle, as it acts as a source of reducing power that is used to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.",
