Which of the following must be a factor of the number?\n\nA. 4\nB. 6\nC. 10\nD. 15\n\nassistant:To determine which of the given options must be a factor of the number, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the prime factors.\n\nThe prime factors of the number are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. Let's find their GCD:\n\n2 \ufffd 2 = 1\n5 \ufffd 5 = 1\n7 \ufffd 7 = 1\n13 \ufffd 13 = 1\n31 \ufffd 31 = 1\n\nThe GCD of all these prime factors is 1. This means that the number is a prime number itself.\n\nNow let's check which of the given options are factors of the number:\n\nA. 4: 2\u00b2\nB. 6: 2 \u00d7 3\nC. 10: 2 \u00d7 5\nD. 15: 3 \u00d7 5\n\nNone of the given options is a factor of the number.\n\nTherefore, none of the options must be a factor of the number.",
