This is because when the FED purchases bonds, it effectively increases the amount of reserves held by banks, which in turn leads to an increase in the money supply.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. the money supply will decrease: When the FED buys bonds, it increases the money supply, not decreases it.\nC. the money supply will not be affected: This is incorrect as the money supply is directly affected when the FED buys bonds in the secondary market.\nD. the discount rate would be affected: While the actions of the FED can affect the discount rate, the primary mechanism for influencing the money supply is by purchasing bonds in the secondary market, not through the discount rate.",
