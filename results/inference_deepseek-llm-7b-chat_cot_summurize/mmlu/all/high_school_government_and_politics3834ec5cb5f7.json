Instead, they are often seen as radical or extreme by the public, which leads to their abandonment. Many of their supporters become frustrated and withdraw from the political process, and the third party itself may disintegrate when one or both of the major parties adopt its goals.\n\nSo, the best answer to the question is:\n\nB. They are ultimately abandoned by the public because their politics are perceived as too radical.",
