Monumental works, such as large statues or buildings, indicate a well-established and complex society. These works require a high level of organization, planning, and skill to create, which suggests that the society had a complex social structure and hierarchy.\n\nB. Burials with grave goods are another sign of a complex society. These goods often include valuable items such as jewelry, weapons, or tools. By providing these items to the deceased, the society may have been attempting to express their status, wealth, or power. This suggests that the society had a complex social structure and hierarchy.\n\nC. Leisure and a sedentary lifestyle also indicate a complex society. When people have leisure time and choose to live in one place instead of constantly moving, it suggests that they have enough resources and security to do so. This suggests that the society had a complex social structure and hierarchy, with a well-established system for providing resources and security to its members.",
