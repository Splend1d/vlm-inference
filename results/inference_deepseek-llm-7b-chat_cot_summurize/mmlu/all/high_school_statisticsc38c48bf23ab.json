If the weather is dry that day, there is a 0.2% chance of an accident on Highway 48; if the weather is wet that day, there is a 1.0% chance of an accident. Today, the weather station announced that there is a 20% chance of the weather being wet. What is the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today?\n\nA. 0.0004\nB. 0.0016\nC. 0.002\nD. 0.0036\n\nassistant:To find the probability of an accident on Highway 48 today, we can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(A \u2229 B) = P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) \\* P(B | A)\n\nwhere A is the event that it will be wet weather today, and B is the event that there will be an accident on Highway 48.\n\nWe are given that there is a 20% chance of it being wet today, so P(A) = 0.2. We also know that if it is wet, there is a 1% chance of an accident, so P(B | A) = 0.01.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 0.2 \\* 0.01 = 0.002\n\nSo the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today is 0.002, which corresponds to answer C.",
