Their mean income is $20,500, and the standard deviation of their incomes is $3,750. The distribution of incomes is normally distributed. How many of the 400 employees do you expect to have an income of between $13,000 and $28,000?\n\nA. 50\nB. 100\nC. 200\nD. 390\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of normal distribution and the given information.\n\nStep 1: Find the z-scores for the given income range.\n\nWe know that the mean income is $20,500 and the standard deviation is $3,750. To find the z-scores, we can use the following formula:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere z is the z-score, x is the income value, \u03bc is the mean income, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the lower bound of the income range ($13,000), the z-score is:\n\nz1 = (13000 - 20500) / 3750 = -2.1\n\nFor the upper bound of the income range ($28,000), the z-score is:\n\nz2 = (28000 - 20500) / 3750 = 2.8\n\nStep 2: Find the probability of the z-scores.\n\nWe need to find the probability of having incomes between z1 and z2. To do this, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nP(z1 < x < z2) = P(z2 < x < z1)\n\nWe can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probabilities for z1 and z2:\n\nP(z1) = P(z1 < x) = P(x < z1) = 0.1671\nP(z2) = P(z2 < x) = P(x < z2) = 0.8329\n\nStep 3: Find the number of employees in the income range.\n\nNow, we can find the number of employees with incomes between $13,000 and $28,000 using the cumulative probabilities:\n\nNumber of employees = (P(z2) - P(z1)) * 400\nNumber of employees = (0.8329 - 0.1671) * 400\nNumber of employees = 0.6658 * 400\nNumber of employees = 266.32\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an employee, we can round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nNumber of employees = 266\n\nTherefore, there are 266 employees with incomes between $13,000 and $28,000. The closest option to this answer is C. 200.",
