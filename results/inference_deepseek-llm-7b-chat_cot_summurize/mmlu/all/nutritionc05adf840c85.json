The plasma concentration of calcitonin\nB. The plasma concentration of prothrombin\nC. The time for blood to clot\nD. Haemolysis due to oxidative damage to red cell membranes\n\nassistant:B. The plasma concentration of prothrombin\n\nVitamin K is essential for the synthesis of prothrombin, which is a protein that helps the blood to clot. Therefore, a vitamin K deficiency can lead to a decrease in the plasma concentration of prothrombin and an increased risk of bleeding.",
