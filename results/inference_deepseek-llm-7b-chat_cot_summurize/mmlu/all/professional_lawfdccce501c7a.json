However, the court may exclude the testimony if it is not more probative than any other evidence the skier can procure through reasonable efforts, or if the skier has not given the ski resort reasonable notice that they would offer the deposition. In this case, the deposition was offered in good faith, and the skier had given the ski resort reasonable notice, so it would be admissible.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because former testimony is generally admissible, but it must meet certain requirements to be admissible.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the right to confront witnesses is not violated by the admission of former testimony.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the deposition testimony is not considered hearsay, as it was taken during a discovery deposition and is therefore not subject to the rules of hearsay.",
