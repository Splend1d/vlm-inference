Their calendars, which were based on their observations of the sky, were far more precise than those of their contemporaries, and their mathematical calculations were equally impressive.\n\nThe Maya were also known for their extensive stone carvings and inscriptions, which provide a wealth of information on their culture, religion, and beliefs. However, unlike Mesopotamian writings, which often focused on political and military history, the Maya records primarily deal with astronomy, mathematics, and calendrical systems.\n\nTheir astronomical observations were so precise that they were able to predict the positions of celestial bodies, and even the alignment of planets and stars. This knowledge was crucial to the Maya, who relied heavily on agriculture and required precise knowledge of the weather and planting seasons.\n\nThe Maya also developed complex mathematical systems that allowed them to accurately predict the passage of time and the movement of celestial bodies. They were able to create calendars that spanned hundreds of years, and their calculations were used to predict the cycles of the moon, the sun, and other astronomical events.\n\nIn conclusion, the Maya records were principally concerned with astronomy and mathematics, while Mesopotamian writings were more focused on political and military history.",
