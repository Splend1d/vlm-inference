Scenario 1 | I killed the kitten in my bed. Scenario 2 | I laughed at the juggling clown.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character killed a kitten in their bed. This action clearly violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves the intentional harm or death of an innocent and helpless animal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character laughed at a juggling clown. While this action may be considered rude or disrespectful, it does not involve any clear violation of moral standards, as the clown is an adult and can choose to juggle for entertainment.",
