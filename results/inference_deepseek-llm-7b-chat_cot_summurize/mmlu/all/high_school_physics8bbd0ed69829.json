Keeping the charge of each ball the same, the mass of one of the balls but not the other is doubled. What is the new electric force between the balls?\n\nA. 50 \u03bcN\nB. 100 \u03bcN\nC. 200 \u03bcN\nD. 400 \u03bcN\n\nassistant:The answer is B. 100 \u03bcN.\n\nWhen the charge of each ball is kept the same, doubling the mass of one of the balls will increase the electric force between them. The force between two point charges with distance 'd' is given by Coulomb's law: F = (k * Q1 * Q2) / d^2, where 'k' is the Coulomb constant (9 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2) and Q1 and Q2 are the charges on the balls.\n\nSince the charges are the same, we can write the force between the balls as F = k * Q^2 / d^2. When the mass of one of the balls is doubled, the force on that ball will be reduced by a factor of \u221a2. Therefore, the new force between the balls will be F_new = (k * Q^2 / d^2) * (\u221a2).\n\nLet's denote the original force as F_old = 50 \u03bcN. We are given that F_old = k * Q^2 / d^2. Plugging this into the equation for F_new, we get:\n\nF_new = (k * Q^2 / d^2) * (\u221a2)\n\nWe can then solve for the new force:\n\nF_new = 100 \u03bcN\n\nTherefore, the new electric force between the balls is 100 \u03bcN.",
