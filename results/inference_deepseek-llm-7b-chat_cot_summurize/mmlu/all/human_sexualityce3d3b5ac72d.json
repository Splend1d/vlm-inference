Identify the key terms in the question: \"menstrual cycle\", \"monkey species\", \"ape species\", \"dogs\", and \"some breeds of dogs\".\n2. Analyze the question to determine the relationships between the terms: We are comparing the presence of menstrual cycles in different species or breeds of animals.\n3. Evaluate the options based on the relationships:\n\nA. Some monkey species - Monkeys are mammals, and mammals typically have menstrual cycles. So, this option is plausible.\nB. Some ape species - Apes are also mammals, and like monkeys, they typically have menstrual cycles. So, this option is also plausible.\nC. Some breeds of dogs - Dogs are mammals, but not all breeds have menstrual cycles. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that all or some breeds of dogs have menstrual cycles. So, this option is not certain.\nD. A and B only - This option is plausible since both monkey species and ape species are mammals, and as mentioned above, most mammals have menstrual cycles.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is:\n\nD. A and B only",
