Perception.\n\nThe consumer proposition acquisition process consists of four main stages: motive development, information gathering, proposition evaluation, and perception. Perception refers to how consumers interpret and understand the information they have gathered during the information gathering stage, and how they evaluate and compare different propositions in order to make a decision. While perception is an important part of the consumer proposition acquisition process, it is not one of the four main stages listed in the question.",
