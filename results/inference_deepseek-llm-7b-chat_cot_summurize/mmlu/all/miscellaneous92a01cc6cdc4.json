Identify the key information in the question: \"United States\", \"past week\", and \"coffee consumption\".\n2. Use my knowledge of the United States population and coffee consumption data to estimate the number of cups of coffee consumed in the United States in the past week (as of 2013).\n3. Compare the estimated number of cups of coffee consumed in the United States in the past week (as of 2013) with the options provided (A, B, C, D) and identify the closest option.\n\nBased on my knowledge, the average annual coffee consumption per capita in the United States is around 400 cups per year. In the past week (as of 2013), the U.S. population was around 314 million people. Therefore, the estimated number of cups of coffee consumed in the United States in the past week (as of 2013) is 314 million cups per week.\n\nComparing this number with the given options:\nA. 300 million cups per week\nB. 1 billion cups per week\nC. 3 billion cups per week\nD. 9 billion cups per week\n\nThe closest option to the estimated number of cups of coffee consumed in the United States in the past week (as of 2013) is option A, with 300 million cups per week.",
