If the text segment of P begins at 0x77E80000 in P\u2019s virtual address space and if the debugger has mapped this same text segment at 0x01000000 in its virtual address space, which of the following is the virtual address used by the debugger in its WRITE operation, along with a description of how the debugger has mapped the virtual memory page containing this address?\n\nA. 0x01001234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access\nB. 0x01001234; page mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access\nC. 0x76E81234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access\nD. 0x76E81234; page mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the virtual addresses in the two virtual address spaces (P and the debugger). \n\nFirst, let's find the virtual address used by the debugger in its WRITE operation:\n\n1. The text segment of process P begins at 0x77E80000 in P's virtual address space.\n2. The debugger has mapped this same text segment at 0x01000000 in its virtual address space.\n\nThe virtual address used by the debugger for the load instruction (0x77E81234) is the same as the virtual address used by the debugger for the WRITE operation in its virtual address space.\n\nNow, let's consider the mapping of the virtual memory page containing the virtual address 0x77E81234 in process P's virtual address space.\n\n1. The debugger placed a breakpoint at a load instruction at virtual address 0x77E81234 in process P.\n2. The text segment of process P begins at 0x77E80000 in P's virtual address space.\n\nSince the load instruction is being executed in process P, the virtual memory page containing the virtual address 0x77E81234 must be the same as the virtual memory page containing the text segment of process P.\n\nTherefore, the virtual address used by the debugger in its WRITE operation, along with a description of how the debugger has mapped the virtual memory page containing this address, is:\n\nA. 0x01001234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access",
