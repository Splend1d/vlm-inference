The equation is: 3x - 4(x - 2) + 6x - 8 = 0. First, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n3x - 4x + 8 + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, let's simplify the parentheses:\n\n(-1x + 8) + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nNext, combine the x terms:\n\n7x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, let's solve for x by adding 8 to both sides:\n\n7x = 8\n\nFinally, divide by 7:\n\nx = 8/7\n\nSo, the value of x is 8/7. Since the answer is not listed in the given options, it means the answer is not one of the choices.",
