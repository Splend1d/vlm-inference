This is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character used online forums to find women to date. This could be considered morally wrong, depending on the circumstances and the intentions behind it. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine if this is clearly morally wrong or not. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Wrong, Not wrong\" as it is possible that the actions in Scenario 1 are not morally wrong, while the actions in Scenario 2 could be morally wrong depending on the circumstances.",
