The amplitude is a measure of the height of the wave, or how much the sound energy fluctuates as it travels. The amplitude of a sound wave is directly related to the loudness of the sound, with larger amplitudes resulting in louder sounds. The other options are not as closely related to the loudness of a sound:\n\nA. Frequency refers to the number of oscillations of the wave per unit of time, and is related to the pitch of the sound.\nB. Period refers to the time it takes for the wave to complete one full oscillation.\nC. Wavelength refers to the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of the wave.",
