In his book \"The Care Theory of Justice,\" Carens argues that developed countries should provide aid to poor countries and enable their citizens to have a better life, rather than imposing strict restrictions on immigration. However, he also acknowledges that in some cases, restrictions on free migration can be justified, such as when they are necessary to preserve a distinct culture or way of life in the receiving country.",
