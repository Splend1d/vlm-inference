However, the subsequent session of the state legislature passed a bill prohibiting baseball, which led to a lack of admission charges. This lack of admission charges would impair the obligation of the bondholders' contract, as they would not be able to use the required amount of admission charges to repay the bond debt. Therefore, the statute is unconstitutional.",
