They passed laws intended to persecute and harass foreign residents.\n\nassistant:The Chinese emperor's response to King George III's envoys in 1793 reflects their belief in their own superiority and the lack of interest in foreign objects. It also shows their intention to maintain control over trade and not to be influenced by the technological advancements of other countries.\n\nDuring the era 1750-1900, the Chinese government did impose extraordinary tariffs on foreign products to restrict foreign trade. This was a way to protect their domestic industries and ensure that their own products had a competitive advantage. The Chinese also controlled the trade routes, which further limited foreign influence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question of how the Chinese restricted foreign trade during this era is:\n\nC. The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products.",
