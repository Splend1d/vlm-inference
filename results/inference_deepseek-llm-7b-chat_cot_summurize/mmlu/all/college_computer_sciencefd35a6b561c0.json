A 32-bit segment of this string has the hexadecimal value D4FE2003. The percentage of occupied tracks for the corresponding part of the disk, to the nearest percent, is\n\nA. 12%\nB. 25%\nC. 38%\nD. 44%\n\nassistant:To determine the percentage of occupied tracks, we can use the binary representation of the hexadecimal value D4FE2003. \n\nFirst, we convert the hexadecimal value to binary:\n\nD4FE2003 (hex) = 0x106000\n\nNow, we convert the binary value to decimal:\n\n0x106000 (bin) = 1010101000000\n\nNext, we count the number of occupied bits:\n\n1010101000000 (bin) = 56 (decimal)\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of occupied tracks:\n\n56 (occupied bits) / 128 (total bits) * 100 = 44%\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 44%.",
