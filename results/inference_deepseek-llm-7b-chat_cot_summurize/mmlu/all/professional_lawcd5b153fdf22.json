No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n\nThe manufacturer of the drug did not have access to the full extent of scientific knowledge when the product was developed and put on the market. Therefore, it cannot be held strictly liable for a defect that was not yet known at the time. However, the manufacturer can still be held liable for negligence or gross negligence, which means that they may have failed to exercise reasonable care in the development and testing of the drug.",
