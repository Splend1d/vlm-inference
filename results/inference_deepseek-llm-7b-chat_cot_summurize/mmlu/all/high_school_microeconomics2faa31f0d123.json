Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given information and calculate the profit for each option:\n\nA. Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $20.\n\nShort-run profit = Total revenue - Total cost\nShort-run profit = ($10 * 9) - ($80 + $20)\nShort-run profit = $90 - $100\nShort-run profit = $10\n\nOption A is incorrect because the short-run profit is positive, and Jason should continue operating.\n\nB. Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10.\n\nShort-run profit = Total revenue - Total cost\nShort-run profit = ($10 * 9) - ($80 + $20)\nShort-run profit = $90 - $100\nShort-run profit = -$10\n\nOption B is incorrect because the short-run profit is negative, indicating economic losses, but Jason should continue operating.\n\nC. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.\n\nThis option contradicts the information given in the problem, as Jason has a positive short-run profit ($10) when cleaning 9 pools per day.\n\nD. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.\n\nShort-run profit = Total revenue - Total cost\nShort-run profit = ($10 * 9) - ($80 + $20)\nShort-run profit = $90 - $100\nShort-run profit = -$10\n\nOption D is incorrect because the short-run profit is negative, indicating economic losses, but Jason should continue operating.\n\nNone of the given options are true for Jason's situation in the perfectly competitive local market.",
