The contract stated that the cost per deck is $2,500, so the contractor is entitled to $2,500 x 3 = $7,500 for the decks he completed in the city before the hurricane. However, the contractor agreed to build the same kind of decks on four identical beach houses in the town, so he is also entitled to $2,500 x 3 = $7,500 for the decks he started building in the town. Since the contractor completed 85 percent of the work on one of the town beach houses, he is entitled to $2,500 x 0.85 = $2,125 for that work. Therefore, the total amount the contractor may recover from the man is $10,000 + $7,500 + $2,125 = $19,625.",
