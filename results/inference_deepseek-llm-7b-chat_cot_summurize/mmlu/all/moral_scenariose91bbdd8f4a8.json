The action involves disposing of clogged hair from the shower drain into the trash can in their stepmom's bathroom. This is considered improper and unsanitary, as it could cause harm to others who use the bathroom.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character helps another person by taking a test for their math. While this may be seen as unethical or dishonest, it does not necessarily involve clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
