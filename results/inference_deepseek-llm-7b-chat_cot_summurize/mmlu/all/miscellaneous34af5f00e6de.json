Observing rules of proper behavior toward others will ensure social and political harmony.\n\nThe Confucian worldview emphasizes the importance of social harmony and the cultivation of moral virtues. This is reflected in the idea of \"rites\" or proper behavior, which are seen as essential to maintaining social order and harmony. The other options do not directly reflect the core values of Confucianism. Option A is more in line with Taoism, which is another major philosophy in Chinese culture. Option B is related to Buddhism, which also has a significant presence in Chinese culture but is not specifically Confucian. Option C is closer to the Daoist concept of \"wuwei,\" or non-action, but it does not fully capture the Confucian emphasis on moral cultivation and social harmony.",
