Roman Catholics\nB. Puritans\nC. Quakers\nD. Anglicans\n\nassistant:The text provided discusses William Penn's Charter of Privileges, which grants freedom of conscience and religious tolerance to the inhabitants of Pennsylvania and territories. This document was issued by William Penn on October 28, 1701. William Penn was a prominent leader and founder of Pennsylvania, who established the colony as a haven for Quakers, a religious group that faced persecution in England and other parts of the world.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Society of Friends, are a religious movement that originated in England in the early 17th century. They believe in the power of inner guidance and seek to live in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Quakers are known for their non-violent activism and their commitment to social justice.\n\nQuakers were persecuted in England for their beliefs, as they rejected the established Church of England and its doctrines. This led to the persecution of Quakers, who were often subjected to violence, imprisonment, fines, and even execution. William Penn himself was imprisoned and exiled for his Quaker beliefs.\n\nThe text provided mentions William Penn's support for religious tolerance and his desire for people to live in peace and quietness, as long as they acknowledge one almighty God and live peacefully under the civil government. This suggests that William Penn was a member of the persecuted religious group known as Quakers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. Quakers",
