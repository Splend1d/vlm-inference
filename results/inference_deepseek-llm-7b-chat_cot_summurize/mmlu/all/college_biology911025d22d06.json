These species are often the primary source of food for many other species in the ecosystem, and their presence or absence can have a significant impact on the overall health and stability of the ecosystem.\n\nOption A is incorrect because keystone species do not necessarily reduce diversity by eliminating food resources for other species. In fact, they often provide a critical food resource for many other species.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while keystone species may be more abundant than most other species in their communities, this is not the primary reason for their importance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because keystone species do not necessarily prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction. Instead, they play a critical role in maintaining the balance and stability of the ecosystem by providing a food resource for many other species.",
