At trial, after briefing from both parties, the court permitted the jury to hear testimony that there had been several previous accidents in the same building. The jury found for the student, and the university appealed. One of the university's arguments on appeal is that the testimony about the previous accidents should have been excluded as irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Which standard of review applies to this argument?\n\nA. Abuse of discretion.\nB. Clearly erroneous.\nC. De novo.\nD. Harmless error.\n\nassistant:This is an argument about the admissibility of evidence at trial, specifically testimony about previous accidents in the same building. The standard of review that applies to this argument is abuse of discretion.\n\nAbuse of discretion is a standard of review that is used when a court reviews a decision made by a lower court or administrative agency. It is used when the decision made by the lower court or agency involves a significant departure from the proper exercise of discretion. In this case, the university is arguing that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the jury to hear the testimony about previous accidents, which it believes was irrelevant and highly prejudicial.\n\nThe other standards of review (Clearly erroneous, De novo, and Harmless error) do not apply to this argument. Clearly erroneous is a standard of review used when a lower court's decision is clearly against the weight of the evidence, and De novo is a standard of review that requires a court to review a decision made by a lower court or agency as if it were making the decision for the first time. Harmless error is a standard of review that applies when a court finds that an error was committed, but that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.\n\nIn summary, the standard of review that applies to the university's argument about the admissibility of the testimony about previous accidents is abuse of discretion.",
