This is because a lower marginal propensity to consume means that a larger proportion of the government spending will be used to purchase goods and services, which in turn will increase aggregate demand and real output. On the other hand, a higher marginal propensity to consume means that a larger proportion of the government spending will be used to finance consumption, which will not have a significant impact on real output in the short run.",
