Scenario 1 | My little brother has a peanut allergy so I gave him peanut free cookies. Scenario 2 | I turned up the music when my neighbors complained about the noise in my apartment.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is giving peanut-free cookies to their little brother to avoid any potential allergic reaction. This action is morally good as it prioritizes the safety and well-being of their sibling.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is turning up the music in their apartment when their neighbors complain about the noise. This action could be seen as morally wrong as it could potentially disturb the neighbors and infringe upon their right to peace and quiet. However, the main character does not do anything clearly morally wrong, as they are only responding to a complaint.",
