One result of this policy would be\n\nA. a decrease in the demand for coffee-brewing machines.\nB. a persistent shortage of coffee in the market.\nC. an increase in consumer surplus due to lower coffee prices.\nD. an increase in the demand for coffee.\n\nassistant:C. an increase in consumer surplus due to lower coffee prices.\n\nA price floor is a minimum price below which a product cannot be sold. In the case of coffee, a price floor would be a policy that sets a minimum price for coffee beans, preventing them from falling below that price. One of the results of this policy would be an increase in consumer surplus due to lower coffee prices.\n\nConsumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a product and the actual price they pay for it. When a price floor is implemented, the minimum price is set below the market equilibrium price, which means that consumers can purchase coffee at a lower price than they would have otherwise. This increases their consumer surplus, as they are getting more value for their money.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily accurate results of a price floor policy. A price floor would not necessarily decrease the demand for coffee-brewing machines, as the demand for these machines is not directly related to the price of coffee. A persistent shortage of coffee in the market could occur if the price floor is set too high, causing sellers to exit the market or reduce their production. An increase in the demand for coffee could also occur if the price floor is set too low, as consumers may overconsume coffee due to its affordability.",
