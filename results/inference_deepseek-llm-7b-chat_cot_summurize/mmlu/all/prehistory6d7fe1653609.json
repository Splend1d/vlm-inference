They are known for their advanced agricultural techniques, irrigation systems, and elaborate canal networks. Mesoamerica, a region that includes present-day Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, is famous for its complex societies and their connections to the ancient civilizations of the Americas.\n\nIn your question, you are looking for evidence that the Hohokam borrowed a practice from Mesoamerican culture. Among the options given, A, B, and C are practices that were common in Mesoamerica but not in the Hohokam culture. The Hohokam did not practice ritual human sacrifice, as it was uncommon in their societies. They did not engage in playing ritual ball games, as there is no evidence to support this.\n\nOption D, \"construction of stepped pyramids,\" is the most plausible answer. While the Hohokam did not build stepped pyramids like those found in Mesoamerica, they did construct other types of structures, including pit houses, granaries, and ball courts. These structures often featured multiple stories and platforms, which could be interpreted as \"stepped\" in a way. However, it is important to note that these structures were not built with the same architectural style or purpose as the stepped pyramids found in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe Hohokam's architectural techniques and materials were similar to those found in other ancient cultures, such as the Anasazi and Mogollon, who inhabited the region before and during the Hohokam period. Despite this, there is evidence that the Hohokam borrowed some practices from their neighboring cultures, such as the Mogollon, who had a more complex societal structure and practiced agriculture and irrigation similar to the Hohokam.\n\nIn conclusion, although the Hohokam did not borrow the practice of ritual consumption of maize beer or ritual human sacrifice from Mesoamerican culture, there is evidence that they borrowed the practice of building stepped pyramids from their neighboring cultures, such as the Mogollon.",
