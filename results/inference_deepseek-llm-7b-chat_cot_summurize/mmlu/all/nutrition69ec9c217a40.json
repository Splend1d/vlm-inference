Depressive symptoms\nB. Significant Weight Loss\nC. Body Image Distortion\nD. Fear of becoming fat\n\nassistant:Anorexia Nervosa is a complex mental health disorder that can manifest in various ways, and each diagnostic feature is important in understanding and treating the condition. Among the options provided, the one that is not considered a diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa is:\n\nD. Fear of becoming fat\n\nThis is because the fear of becoming fat is more associated with the eating disorder Bulimia Nervosa rather than Anorexia Nervosa. In Anorexia Nervosa, individuals often exhibit a distorted body image, and they may have a strong fear of being perceived as overweight or obese, but this fear itself is not a diagnostic feature of the disorder.",
