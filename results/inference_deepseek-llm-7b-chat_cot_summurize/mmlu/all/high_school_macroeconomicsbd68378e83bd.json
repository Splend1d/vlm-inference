The MPC is a measure of the proportion of additional income that is spent on consumption. It is calculated as:\n\nMPC = (Additional consumption / Additional income) * 100\n\nGiven that the MPC is 0.8, it means that for every additional dollar of income, 80 cents is spent on consumption and 20 cents is saved.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario of a $500 increase in spending. This increase in spending will result in an additional $400 of income (500 - 100 = 400).\n\nUsing the MPC, we can calculate the proportion of this additional income that will be spent on consumption:\n\nMPC = (Additional consumption / Additional income) * 100\nMPC = (400 / 400) * 100\nMPC = 1 * 100\nMPC = 100%\n\nSince the MPC is 100%, all of the additional $400 of income will be spent on consumption. This means that the largest total increase in GDP will be the same as the increase in consumption, which is $400.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $400.",
