After the defendant learned about these rumors, she was furious and decided that she would teach the woman to keep her mouth shut. Late that night, the defendant went over to the woman's house with the intent to punch her in the mouth. When the defendant arrived at the woman's home, she peered in the bedroom window and saw the woman asleep in bed. The defendant proceeded to pry open the bedroom window and climbed inside. The defendant then grabbed the woman and punched her in the face and hurriedly fled from the home. The force of the blow fractured the woman's jaw. If the defendant is subsequently prosecuted for burglary, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because she broke into the woman's home at night with the intent to commit a felony therein.\nB. guilty, because the woman suffered a broken jaw as a result of the blow inflicted by the defendant.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to seriously injure the woman.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to commit a felony at the time of the breaking and entry.\n\nassistant:The defendant will most likely be found guilty for several reasons. First, she broke into the woman's home at night with the intent to commit a felony therein. This would make her guilty of the charge of burglary, a felony crime. Second, she inflicted serious bodily harm to the woman by punching her in the face, causing her jaw to fracture. This would make her guilty of the charge of aggravated assault, another felony crime.\n\nGiven these two charges, the defendant will likely be found guilty of both burglary and aggravated assault. However, the specific outcome will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the evidence presented in court.\n\nIt is important to note that the outcome of a criminal case is ultimately determined by a judge or jury, and the defendant has the right to a fair and impartial trial. In this case, the defendant's intent to commit a felony and the serious bodily harm she caused to the woman make her likely to be found guilty.",
