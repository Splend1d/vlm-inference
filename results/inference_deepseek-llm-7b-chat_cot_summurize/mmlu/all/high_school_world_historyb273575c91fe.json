The passage mentions that the Romanists (Catholics) claim that only the Pope has the authority to interpret the Scriptures, while Luther (the author) criticizes this notion, arguing that the Pope is not infallible in matters of faith, and that the Holy Spirit can dwell in pious souls, not just in those at the Roman Church.",
