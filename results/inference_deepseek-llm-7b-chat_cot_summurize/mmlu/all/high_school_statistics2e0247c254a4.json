The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the changes step by step:\n\n1. The rent increases by 5 percent, which can be represented as 5 percent of the current rent value.\n2. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents.\n\nThe original range of prices is from $3.99 to $29.99. After the price increase, the new minimum price will be the old maximum price ($29.99 + 0.50) = $30.49, and the new maximum price will be the old minimum price ($3.99 + 0.50) = $4.49. So, the new range of prices will be from $3.99 to $4.49.\n\nNow let's calculate the new mean price. The old mean price is $14.75. After the price increase, the new mean price will be ($3.99 + $29.99) / 2 = $14.99.\n\nSo, the mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n\nThe correct answer is A. The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.",
