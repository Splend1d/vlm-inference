Functional immunity covers the person but not the act\nB. Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act\nC. Functional immunity covers the State and incidentally also the act\nD. Functional immunity covers both private and public acts as long as they are sanctioned by the State\n\nassistant:Functional immunity, also known as \"ratione materiae\" immunity, refers to a legal doctrine that provides protection to certain individuals or entities from legal liability for actions or conduct that are specifically authorized or permitted by law. In other words, functional immunity applies when the person or entity being sued is performing a function or exercising a power that is conferred by the law.\n\nUnder this doctrine, the person or entity is immune from liability for any resulting harm or damages, even if the conduct or action that caused the harm was unreasonable or improper. The purpose of functional immunity is to encourage individuals and entities to carry out their legal duties and functions without fear of being sued for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe correct answer to the question is D. Functional immunity covers both private and public acts as long as they are sanctioned by the law. This means that functional immunity applies not only to acts performed by public officials or entities, but also to acts performed by private individuals or entities that are authorized or permitted by law.",
