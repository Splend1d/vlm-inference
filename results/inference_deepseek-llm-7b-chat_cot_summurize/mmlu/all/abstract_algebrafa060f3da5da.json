Statement 2 | If V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent.\nThis statement is true. In the real plane (R^2), if a set of two vectors are linearly independent, it means that they cannot be represented as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. For example, if {v1, v2} are two vectors in R^2, they are linearly independent if and only if the only way to express v2 as a linear combination of v1 is to have v2 = a*v1, where a is a scalar.\n\nStatement 2: If V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.\nThis statement is false. The dimension of a set of vectors is equal to the number of independent vectors in the set. If {v1, v2} are linearly independent and span a set V of dimension k, then there must be k linearly independent vectors in V. However, it is not necessarily the case that v1 and v2 are among these k linearly independent vectors. For example, consider a set V = {v1, v2, v3} in R^3, where v1 and v2 are linearly independent, but v3 is not. In this case, v3 is not a linearly independent vector in V, yet V = span(v1, v2) = span(v3). Therefore, dim(V) = k, but v1 and v2 are not among the k linearly independent vectors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False",
