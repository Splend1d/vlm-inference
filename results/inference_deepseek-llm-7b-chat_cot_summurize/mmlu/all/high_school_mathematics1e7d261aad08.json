What is the probability that the two numbers rolled sum to 4?\n\nA. \\frac{1}{4}\nB. \\frac{1}{12}\nC. \\frac{1}{3}\nD. \\frac{1}{9}\n\nassistant:To find the probability that the sum of the two numbers rolled is 4, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. List all possible outcomes: There are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n2. Count the number of outcomes that sum to 4: We can do this by counting the number of outcomes that sum to 4, 5, 6, and 7, and then subtracting the ones that sum to 4.\n\nNumber of outcomes that sum to 4:\n- (1, 3)\n- (2, 2)\n- (3, 1)\n- (4, 0)\n- (5, -1)\n- (6, -2)\n\nNumber of outcomes that sum to 5:\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 3)\n- (3, 2)\n- (4, 1)\n- (5, 0)\n- (6, -1)\n\nNumber of outcomes that sum to 6:\n- (1, 5)\n- (2, 4)\n- (3, 3)\n- (4, 2)\n- (5, 1)\n- (6, 0)\n\nNumber of outcomes that sum to 7:\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 4)\n- (4, 3)\n- (5, 2)\n- (6, 1)\n\nTotal number of outcomes: 36\n\nNumber of outcomes that sum to 4: 6\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the two numbers rolled is 4 is:\n\nP(sum = 4) = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\nSo the correct answer is C. \\frac{1}{3}.",
