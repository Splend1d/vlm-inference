Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters.\n\nEthernets use a technology called Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD), which is a distributed protocol that allows for multiple hosts to share the same physical medium. This means that Ethernet networks can span long distances, rather than being limited to a few hundred meters as the statement suggests.",
