The landowner lived in a farmhouse on the orchard and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the orchard directly to the west was a 10-acre vineyard that was owned in fee simple by a farmer.

The farmer discovered that the southern portion of the orchard was rarely used by the landowner for any of the landowner's farming activities and found a convenient gravel road leading from the vineyard across the orchard all the way to the four- lane highway. The farmer used this road adversely and openly for the entire 20-year prescriptive period, and in doing so, the farmer has acquired a prescriptive easement over the roadway across the orchard.

The description in the farmer's deed to the buyer was inadequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway. The deed only mentioned an easement for the right of way across the orchard, but did not specify which portion of the orchard was included in the easement. Therefore, the landowner was able to bring an action to prevent the buyer from using the roadway across the orchard.\n\nB. The buyer will make excessive use of the roadway is not relevant to the outcome of the suit. The issue at hand is whether the buyer has acquired an easement over the roadway, not whether they will use it excessively.\n\nC. Easements can be reserved to third parties is not relevant to the outcome of the suit. The issue at hand is whether the buyer has acquired an easement over the roadway, not whether it can be reserved to third parties.\n\nD. The easement was appurtenant is also not relevant to the outcome of the suit. The issue at hand is whether the buyer has acquired an easement over the roadway, not whether it was appurtenant.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is A. The description in the farmer's deed to the buyer was inadequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway.",
