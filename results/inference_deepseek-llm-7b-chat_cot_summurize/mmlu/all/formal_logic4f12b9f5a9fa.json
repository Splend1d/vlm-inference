B \u2283 W\nB. W \u2283 B\nC. B \u2261 W\nD. Both A and B\n\nassistant:To determine which formula is the best symbolization of the given sentence, we need to analyze the relationship between the subject, verb, and object.\n\nStep 1: Identify the subject, verb, and object in the sentence.\n- Subject: Beth\n- Verb: rides\n- Object: her bike\n- Result: gets to work earlier\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the subject, verb, and object.\n- If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier.\n\nThis sentence implies that riding the bike is the cause of getting to work earlier.\n\nStep 3: Match the relationship to one of the given formulas.\n- A. B \u2283 W: If B, then W\n- B. W \u2283 B: W \u2192 B\n- C. B \u2261 W: B is equal to W\n- D. Both A and B: Both formulas apply\n\nStep 4: Determine which formula best represents the relationship between the subject, verb, and object.\n- Formula A represents a conditional relationship, where B causes W.\n- Formula B represents a direct relationship, where W is the result of B.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best symbolization of the given sentence is formula A. Therefore, the answer is A. B \u2283 W.",
