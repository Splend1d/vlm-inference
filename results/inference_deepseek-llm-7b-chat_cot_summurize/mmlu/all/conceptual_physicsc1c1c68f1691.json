None of these\n\nassistant:B. Longitudinal waves\n\nPolarization refers to the direction of oscillation of the electric or magnetic field of a wave. Longitudinal waves, such as sound waves or water waves, have their oscillations in the same direction that the wave travels. Transverse waves, on the other hand, have their oscillations perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. Therefore, polarization is a property of longitudinal waves and not of transverse waves or all waves.",
