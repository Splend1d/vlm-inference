We can rewrite $x\\sqrt{x^3}$ as $x\\sqrt{x^3}$ by applying the power rule, which states that when a variable raised to a power is multiplied by another variable raised to the same power, the exponents add. So, $x\\sqrt{x^3} = x^{1+\\frac{3}{2}} = x^2\\sqrt{x^3}$. Now, we can simplify the expression $(x^2\\sqrt{x^3})^4$ by applying the power rule again: $x^2\\sqrt{x^3}^4 = x^{2\\cdot4}\\sqrt{x^3}^4 = x^8\\sqrt{x^3}^4$. Since $x^3$ is raised to the power of 4, we can rewrite the expression as $x^8\\sqrt{x^{12}}$. Now, we can simplify further by applying the power rule one more time: $x^8\\sqrt{x^{12}} = x^8x^3 = x^{11}$. Finally, we can rewrite the exponent as $x^{11-4} = x^7$. Therefore, the answer is D. 12.",
