The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, \"Deal.\" The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\nB. No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\nD.

Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n\nassistant:A. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\n\nThe statute of frauds is a law that requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the contract between the manufacturer and the supplier was for the supply of 300 washing machine motors of a particular model. The supplier agreed to supply the motors at a price of $300 per motor, for a total price of $90,000. The manufacturer's representative said \"Deal\" to the supplier's offer, indicating a binding agreement.\n\nThe fact that the manufacturer distributed catalogs to its regular customers advertising the specified motors shows that they relied on the contract and believed it was in place. This reliance by the manufacturer makes the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds, even though the note from the manufacturer's representative did not contain a signature. The supplier's statute of frauds defense is unlikely to succeed in this case.",
