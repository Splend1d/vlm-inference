What should Toft report as earnings per share for the year?\n\nA. $2.69\nB. $2.87\nC. $3.00\nD. 3.2\n\nassistant:To calculate the earnings per share (EPS), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of outstanding shares after issuing additional shares on April 1.\n2. Calculate the total dividends paid on nonconvertible preferred stock.\n3. Calculate the net income available for common shareholders.\n4. Calculate the earnings per share.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of outstanding shares after issuing additional shares on April 1.\n120,000 (outstanding shares on January 1) + 40,000 (additional shares issued on April 1) = 160,000 outstanding shares\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total dividends paid on nonconvertible preferred stock.\n$5 (dividend per share) x 1,000 (number of shares of nonconvertible preferred stock) = $5,000\n\nStep 3: Calculate the net income available for common shareholders.\n$480,000 (net income) - $5,000 (dividends paid on nonconvertible preferred stock) = $475,000\n\nStep 4: Calculate the earnings per share (EPS).\n$475,000 (net income available for common shareholders) / 160,000 (outstanding shares) = $2.94375\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the answer is $2.94.
