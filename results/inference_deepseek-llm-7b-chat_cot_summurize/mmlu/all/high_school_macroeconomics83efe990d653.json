This means that a country has imported more than it has exported, which corresponds to option A. A balance of payments deficit can have negative consequences for a country's economy, such as a decrease in its foreign currency reserves and an increase in the value of its domestic currency. On the other hand, a balance of payments surplus occurs when a country exports more than it imports.",
