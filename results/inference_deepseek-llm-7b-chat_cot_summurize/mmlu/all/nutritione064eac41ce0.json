Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\nB. The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese\nC. The problem is one of greed and gluttony, whereby people override strong satiety signals on a regular basis\nD. Flavour signals from tasty, processed food will override satiety signals even after a large meal\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese.\n\nExplanation: The intestine plays a crucial role in the development of obesity. It is responsible for the absorption of nutrients and the regulation of energy intake and expenditure. The gut/brain signalling pathway is a critical component of this process, as it helps to regulate energy intake by sending signals from the gut to the brain that signal fullness and satiety. If this pathway is disrupted, it can lead to overeating and weight gain, which are key factors in the development of obesity. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement about the role of the intestine in the development of obesity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it focuses on the role of gut hormones in regulating appetite, rather than the gut/brain signalling pathway. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that obesity is caused by gluttony and overeating, which is not supported by the evidence. Option D is incorrect because it focuses on the influence of taste signals on appetite, rather than the role of the intestine in overall energy balance.",
