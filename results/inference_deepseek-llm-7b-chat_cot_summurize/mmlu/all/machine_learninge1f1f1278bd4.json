Thus, the variance of a Bernoulli random variable, which is equal to 1 - $\\sigma(x)$, is not equal to the derivative of the sigmoid function.\n\nStatement 2 is True. Setting the bias parameters to 0 in a neural network changes the bias-variance trade-off. The model's variance increases, and the model's bias decreases. This is because removing the bias parameters from the model essentially turns it into a linear model, which has lower bias but higher variance.",
