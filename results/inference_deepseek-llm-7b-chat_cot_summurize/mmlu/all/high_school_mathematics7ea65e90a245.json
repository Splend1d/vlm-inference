We can solve for x by factoring:\n\nx(e^(-x) - 1) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either x = 0 or e^(-x) = 1. Since e^(-x) is always greater than or equal to 0, we have:\n\nx = 0\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = 0\nf(1) = e^(-1)\nf(-1) = e^(-1)\n\nSince f(0) = 0, the maximum value of the function f(x) = xe^(-x) is 1.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nA. 1/e",
