Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character does something clearly morally wrong by sticking a knife in someone's back. This action is harmful and involves violence, which is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character brings a file tool into the courtroom, which is not morally wrong. It may be seen as inappropriate or unethical, but it is not morally wrong in the same sense as the first scenario.",
