Pelvic ultrasonography\nD. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast\n\nassistant:The most appropriate next step in diagnosis for this patient would be a pelvic ultrasonography. This imaging test can provide a detailed view of the pelvic area, including the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, which can help determine if there is any inflammation or other abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago, as well as her intermittent constipation for the past 12 years, also suggest that a pelvic ultrasonography may be beneficial in further evaluating her symptoms.",
