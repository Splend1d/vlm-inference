Increase taxes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase the reserve ratio.\nThis combination of fiscal and monetary policy would increase the reserve ratio, which would reduce the amount of money available in the economy, potentially slowing down economic growth. At the same time, increasing taxes would reduce disposable income, leading to a decrease in consumption and investment, which could worsen the recessionary gap.\n\nB. Decrease spending. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sell Treasury securities.\nDecreasing spending would reduce government expenditures and potentially lead to a decrease in the overall level of aggregate demand in the economy. Selling Treasury securities would reduce the money supply, which could also contribute to slowing down economic growth and reducing the recessionary gap.\n\nC. Decrease taxes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy Treasury securities.\nDecreasing taxes would increase disposable income, leading to an increase in consumption and investment. Buying Treasury securities would increase the money supply, potentially leading to an increase in economic growth and a reduction in the recessionary gap.\n\nD. Increase spending. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase the reserve ratio.\nIncreasing spending would increase aggregate demand and potentially lead to an increase in economic growth. However, increasing the reserve ratio would reduce the money supply, which could potentially counteract the positive effects of increased spending on economic growth.\n\nBased on this analysis, the combination of fiscal and monetary policies that would most likely reduce a recessionary gap is option C: Decrease taxes and Buy Treasury securities. This combination would increase disposable income, leading to an increase in consumption and investment, while also increasing the money supply, which would contribute to an increase in economic growth and a reduction in the recessionary gap.",
