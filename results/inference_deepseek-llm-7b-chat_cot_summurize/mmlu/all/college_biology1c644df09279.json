This is because nodes are where the vascular tissues of the plant are concentrated, allowing for efficient gas exchange to occur.\n\nNodes are the intersections between the xylem and phloem tissues in a woody stem, and they are responsible for transporting water and nutrients to the rest of the plant. These tissues are responsible for gas exchange, as they are in close proximity to the xylem and phloem, allowing for gas exchange to occur efficiently.\n\nIn contrast, terminal buds, which are found at the ends of stems, are responsible for the growth of the plant and not gas exchange. Internodes, which are the spaces between the nodes, are responsible for the support of the plant, and do not play a role in gas exchange. Finally, lenticels, which are small pores found on the bark of woody plants, are not involved in gas exchange.",
