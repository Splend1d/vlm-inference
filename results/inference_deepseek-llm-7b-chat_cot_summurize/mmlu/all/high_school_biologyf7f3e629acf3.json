She notices, after a few generations, a new variant that has a distinct phenotype. When she tries to breed the original phenotype with the new one, no offspring are produced. When she breeds the new variants, however, offspring that look like the new variant result. What originally caused the change in the variant?\n\nA. Karyotyping\nB. Balance polymorphism\nC. Mutation\nD. Polyploidy\n\nassistant:The original cause of the change in the variant is likely to be a mutation. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that occur during the replication of genetic material, leading to changes in the expression of genes and ultimately the phenotype of an organism. In this case, the mutation in the fern population led to the development of a new variant with a distinct phenotype. When the original phenotype was bred with the new variant, no offspring were produced, indicating that the two phenotypes were incompatible. However, when the new variants were bred, offspring with the new phenotype resulted, indicating that the mutation had been passed on to the next generation.",
