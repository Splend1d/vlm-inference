Infants and children normally express sufficient lactase levels as not to experience clinical symptoms. Overall, adults can be classified as lactase-persisters or lactase non-persisters. What is the approximate percentage of Lactase non-persisters worldwide?\n\n\nA. 45%-50%\nB. 70%-75 %\nC. 10%-15%\nD. 30%-35%\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Define the key terms:\n   - Intestinal lactase deficiency: A condition in which the body lacks the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose (a sugar found in milk).\n   - Lactose maldigestion: Inability to properly digest lactose, leading to discomfort and other symptoms.\n   - Lactose intolerance: The inability to digest lactose, leading to discomfort and other symptoms.\n   - Lactase-persisters: People who produce enough lactase to digest lactose, even after their weaning period.\n   - Lactase non-persisters: People who do not produce enough lactase to digest lactose, leading to lactose intolerance.\n\n2. Understand the question: The user is asking for the approximate percentage of people who are lactase non-persisters worldwide.\n\n3. Research the percentage of lactase non-persisters: There is no single source that provides the exact percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide. However, according to the National Library of Medicine, approximately 75% of the world's population is lactose intolerant.\n\n4. Match the found percentage to the answer choices: The percentage of lactase non-persisters is not clearly indicated in the answer choices. However, since 75% is the closest option, I will choose that as the answer.\n\nAnswer: B. 70%-75%",
