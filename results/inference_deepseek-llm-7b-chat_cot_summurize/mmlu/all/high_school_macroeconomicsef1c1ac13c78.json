During a recession, the economy experiences a decrease in overall demand, which can lead to a decline in economic growth and employment. To counteract this, the government can implement a fiscal policy that aims to increase aggregate demand and stimulate economic growth. One way to do this is by increasing government spending, which can create jobs and boost economic activity. At the same time, increasing taxes can help to reduce the budget deficit and encourage economic growth by reducing the burden on businesses and individuals.\n\nOption A is incorrect because running a deficit during a recession can exacerbate the problem by increasing the national debt and making it more difficult to finance government programs. Option B is also incorrect because running a surplus during a recession can reduce government spending and further weaken economic growth. Finally, option D is incorrect because decreasing government spending and taxes during a recession can reduce government's ability to respond to the economic downturn and exacerbate the problem.",
