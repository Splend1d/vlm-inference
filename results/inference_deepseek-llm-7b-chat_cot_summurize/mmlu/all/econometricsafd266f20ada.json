It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude.\n\nThe leverage effect refers to the phenomenon where a small change in one input variable can have a disproportionately large effect on the output variable, compared to the effect of a large change in that input variable. In the context of a news impact curve, this means that small negative events may have a larger impact on the model's output than large positive events of the same magnitude. Therefore, the news impact curve would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude.\n\nB. It would be symmetrical about zero is incorrect because the leverage effect is not symmetric.\nC. It would rise less quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude is also incorrect because the leverage effect actually causes the news impact curve to rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude.\nD. It would be zero for all positive disturbances is incorrect because the leverage effect does not make the news impact curve zero for all positive disturbances.",
