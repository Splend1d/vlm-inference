The proprietor subjectively believed that the man understood that the proprietor would only be obligated to pay a set fee for each mile covered during the charity run.\n\nassistant:Let's break down the question and look at each option:\n\nA. The customary practice of the other charity runs in the community is the same as the proprietor's understanding, that the sponsor be responsible for paying only a set fee for each mile covered during the charity run.\n- This option suggests that the typical practice in the community is the same as the proprietor's understanding. However, it does not directly address whether the man's understanding was different from the proprietor's.\n\nB. A reasonably objective individual would have attached the same meaning to the manifestations of the parties as did the proprietor.\n- This option suggests that an objective individual would have interpreted the contract the same way the proprietor did. However, it does not directly address whether the man's understanding was different from the proprietor's.\n\nC. At the time the agreement was entered into, the man had reason to know the proprietor's understanding of what the parties meant, although the proprietor did not know the man's understanding was different from his.\n- This option suggests that the man knew the proprietor's understanding of the contract, but it does not directly address whether the man's understanding was different from the proprietor's.\n\nD. The proprietor subjectively believed that the man understood that the proprietor would only be obligated to pay a set fee for each mile covered during the charity run.\n- This option directly addresses the question. It states that the proprietor believed the man understood the contract differently than the proprietor did. If this was true, then the man's manifestation (the contract) would not have been operative according to the meaning the proprietor judged.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
