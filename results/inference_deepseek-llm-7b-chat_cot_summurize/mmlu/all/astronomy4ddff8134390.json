Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nUranus and Neptune have blue methane clouds due to the presence of methane (CH4) in their atmospheres. Methane is a greenhouse gas that absorbs infrared radiation, which traps heat and causes the temperature in the atmosphere to rise. In contrast, Jupiter and Saturn have much warmer temperatures due to their massive size and the heat generated by their internal processes. The warmer temperatures in these planets prevent methane from condensing into ice, which is why they do not have blue methane clouds.",
