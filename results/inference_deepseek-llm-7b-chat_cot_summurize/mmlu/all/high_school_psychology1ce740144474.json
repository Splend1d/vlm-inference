However, it does provide guidance on the ethical use of deception in research. According to the APA, deception should be used only when it is necessary and justified in the research design, and the potential benefits of the research outweigh the risks and harms to the participants. Additionally, the use of deception should be disclosed to the participants, and they should be informed of the nature and purpose of the deception.",
