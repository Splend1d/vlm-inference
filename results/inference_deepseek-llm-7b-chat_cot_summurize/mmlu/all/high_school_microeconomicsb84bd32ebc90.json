This is because when the price elasticity of demand is highly elastic, a small change in price will have a significant impact on the quantity demanded by consumers. Therefore, if the supplier is required to pay a tax, they may need to raise prices in order to maintain their profit margin.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price elasticity of demand is highly inelastic, a small change in price will have little effect on the quantity demanded. In this case, the supplier may be able to absorb the cost of the tax without passing it on to the consumer in the form of a price increase.\n\nSimilarly, if the wage elasticity of demand is highly elastic, a small change in wages will have a significant impact on the quantity demanded by consumers. In this case, the supplier may be able to absorb the cost of the tax without passing it on to the consumer in the form of a price increase.\n\nIn summary, if the price elasticity of demand is highly elastic, the supplier is more likely to pass the cost of the tax on to the consumer in the form of a price increase.",
