No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. No, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult.\n\nIn this case, the 16-year-old boy was developmentally disabled and was bullied at school. He took a licensed handgun from his father and shot one of the bullies dead. The district attorney prosecuted the boy as an adult and asked for the death penalty due to aggravating circumstances. The trial court certified the boy over to adult criminal court, and he was convicted and sentenced to death. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Court agreed to hear the case on the merits.\n\nUnder the Eighth Amendment, minors under 16 cannot be tried in adult court, and the whole prosecution was unconstitutional. However, the Court applied the bright-line test that forbids capital punishment of youth under the age of 18 because there are distinct differences between an adolescent and an adult. Therefore, the Court would affirm the sentence of death for the 16-year-old boy, even though he was developmentally disabled and was treated as an adult in the criminal court proceedings.",
