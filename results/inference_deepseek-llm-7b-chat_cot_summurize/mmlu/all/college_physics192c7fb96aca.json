Electron\nB. Meson\nC. Photon\nD. Boson\n\nassistant:The negative muon, mu^-, has properties most similar to that of the electron, which is option A. Muons and electrons are both leptons, a type of fundamental particle in particle physics. They have similar properties such as charge, mass, and spin. The negative muon has the same properties as an electron, except for the fact that it is negatively charged rather than positively charged.\n\nMesons and photons are also fundamental particles, but they belong to different particle families and do not have properties similar to the negative muon. Mesons are made up of two quarks, while photons are elementary particles that carry the electromagnetic force. Bosons, on the other hand, are a class of particles that include both leptons and quarks, but the negative muon is not a boson because it is a lepton.\n\nIn conclusion, the negative muon has properties most similar to that of an electron, which is option A.",
