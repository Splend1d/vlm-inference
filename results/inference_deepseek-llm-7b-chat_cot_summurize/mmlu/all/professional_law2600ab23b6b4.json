The man approached the building, and saw a sign on the door that said, \"Members only \u0080\u0094No restroom facilities available for non-members. \" The owner of the gym hung up the sign because he knew that people frequently entered the gym just to use the restroom, and he was annoyed by this. However, the owner of the gym knew that the sign was not effective and that people still regularly entered the gym just to use the restroom. The man needed to use the bathroom very urgently, so he entered the building despite the sign. The restrooms were near the front door of the gymnasium. The man walked directly to the restroom as soon as he entered the building. The clerk working at the front desk in the gymnasium was busy and did not notice the man enter the building or the restroom. After making use of the restroom facilities, the man washed his hands and proceeded to turn on the electric blow dryer. The dryer, because of a malfunctioning heating coil, emitted intense heat, which caused severe burns to the man's hands. The man was unaware of the fact that 15 minutes earlier, a gym member had received similar injuries from the malfunctioning dryer and notified the gym's owner. The owner immediately taped a \"DO NOT USE\" sign to the dryer. However, the sign had fallen to the floor and was lying face down under the bathroom sink when the man was making use of the restroom.

An absolute duty of care.\n\nassistant:The gym owner had a duty to inspect the premises for unknown dangers and to disclose their existence to others. This includes putting a \"DO NOT USE\" sign on the malfunctioning dryer after a member had already received injuries from it. The gym owner failed in this duty of care by not putting the sign in a visible location, which led to the man using the dryer and getting injured. Therefore, the best answer is B. A duty to inspect the premises for unknown dangers and to disclose their existence to others.",
