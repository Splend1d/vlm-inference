Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Kant does not claim that all sexual relations are immoral. He believes that there is a distinction between sexual desires and moral duties, and that one can fulfill their moral duties even if they experience sexual desires.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Kant's argument does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that it is impossible to treat people in light of their humanity in all circumstances. He believes that one can act morally even if they experience sexual desires.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Kant does not claim that there is a universal law of attraction. His argument is based on the specific context of sexual attraction.",
