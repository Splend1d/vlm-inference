The man claimed that he acted in self-defense after he was attacked by the victim, who was drunk and belligerent. As his first defense witness, the man calls his neighbor to testify that the man is a good neighbor.

The neighbor's testimony that the man is a good neighbor could be used to suggest that the man is unlikely to have committed a violent act in a barroom argument. This is a common tactic used in self-defense cases, where the defendant tries to show that they are not the type of person to commit an unprovoked attack.\n\nB. admissible, because it is relevant to support the man's credibility.\nC. inadmissible, because it is merely the opinion of a character witness.\nD. inadmissible, because it is not directed toward a pertinent trait of the man's character.\n\nThese options are incorrect because the neighbor's testimony is admissible because it is relevant to show the improbability of the man's having committed an unprovoked attack, not because it is merely the opinion of a character witness. Additionally, the testimony is admissible because it is relevant to the man's credibility, not because it is not directed toward a pertinent trait of the man's character.",
