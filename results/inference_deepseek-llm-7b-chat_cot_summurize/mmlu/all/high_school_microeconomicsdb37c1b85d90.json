This means that as the price of the product increases, the quantity demanded by consumers decreases, leading to a downward sloping demand curve. Additionally, the firm's demand curve is equal to the market demand curve, as both curves reflect the total quantity demanded for the product in the market.\n\nOption B is incorrect because in a perfectly competitive market, the firm's demand curve is not perfectly elastic. Perfectly elastic demand means that the price and quantity are indifferent to the consumer, but in a perfectly competitive market, the firm's demand curve is downward sloping, reflecting the law of demand.\n\nOption C is incorrect because in a perfectly competitive market, the firm's demand curve is not perfectly inelastic. Perfectly inelastic demand means that the consumer has no choice but to buy the product, but in a perfectly competitive market, the firm's demand curve is downward sloping, reflecting the law of demand.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it does not describe the demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm's product. The kinked demand curve refers to a situation where the demand curve is not smooth, but this does not apply to a perfectly competitive firm's product.",
