However, the cowboy, who had undergone major heart surgery and was wearing a pacemaker, touched the fence while retrieving his hat, and the electric current short-circuited his pacemaker, resulting in his death by electrocution.\n\nIn a wrongful death action by the cowboy's estate against the rancher, the installation of the electrical wiring device would most likely constitute both the legal cause and the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death. The rancher's negligence in installing the electrical wiring device and not warning others about it could be considered a legal cause of the cowboy's death. Additionally, the electric current short-circuiting the cowboy's pacemaker, which was a direct result of his touching the fence, could be considered the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.",
