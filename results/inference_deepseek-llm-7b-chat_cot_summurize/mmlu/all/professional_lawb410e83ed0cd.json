The boy is not liable because he did not intentionally cause the golf ball to traverse onto the plaintiff's property. The fact that golf balls from the golf course regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property did not give the homeowner a right to be protected from every golf ball that might strike him. The homeowner assumed the risk by choosing to live next to a golf course. The boy's act of hitting the golf ball was not a trespass, and the fact that it deflected off a tree and struck the homeowner does not change this.",
