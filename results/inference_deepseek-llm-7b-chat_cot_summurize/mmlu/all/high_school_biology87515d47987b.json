You would expect to find similar proton pumps in the plasma membranes of\n\nA. bacteria\nB. mammalian muscle cells\nC. mammalian nerve cells\nD. plants and fungi\n\nassistant:B. mammalian muscle cells.\n\nThis is because the process of generating ATP in mammalian muscle cells involves the use of a proton pump, similar to the one described in the question. In this case, the proton pump is called the sodium-potassium pump, which is responsible for pumping three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions. This process helps to maintain the concentration gradient of ions across the membrane and allows for the production of ATP through a process called sodium-potassium exchange.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Bacteria do not have mitochondria, so they do not generate ATP in the same way as eukaryotic cells.\nC. Mammalian nerve cells, also known as neurons, do not generate ATP through the process described in the question. They generate ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which is different from the process described in the question.\nD. Plants and fungi do not have mitochondria, so they do not generate ATP in the same way as eukaryotic cells. However, they do have other ways of generating ATP, such as through the process of photosynthesis.",
