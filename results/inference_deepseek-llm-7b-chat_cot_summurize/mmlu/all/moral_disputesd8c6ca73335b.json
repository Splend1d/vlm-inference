This approach emphasizes that the punishment should be proportional to the offense committed, in order to achieve a balance between the severity of the punishment and the gravity of the offense. This approach is often contrasted with the retributivist approach of preventive retribution, which emphasizes the prevention of future harm as the primary goal of punishment.",
