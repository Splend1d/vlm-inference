The question is about the population of pharaohs and the percentage of farmers among them.\n\nThe correct answer is D, which states that the pharaoh ruled a population of 5,000,000, with 100% of them being farmers. This answer is correct because it correctly identifies the population size and the percentage of farmers among the pharaoh's population.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not correctly identify the population size or the percentage of farmers among the pharaoh's population. Option A states that the population was 100,000 with 25% being farmers, but this is a much smaller population and not consistent with the pharaoh's rule over a large population. Option B states that the population was 1,000,000 with 50% being farmers, but this is still not a large enough population for a pharaoh to rule over. Option C states that the population was 3,000,000 with 75% being farmers, but again, this is not a large enough population for a pharaoh to rule over.",
