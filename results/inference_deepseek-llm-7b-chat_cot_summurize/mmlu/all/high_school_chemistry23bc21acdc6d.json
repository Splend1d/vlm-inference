What will be the molar concentration of iodine vapor if 15 grams of HI gas is introduced into a 12.0-L flask and allowed to come to equilibrium?\n\nA. 4.58 mol/L\nB. 0.00687 mol L-1\nC. 4.4 \u00d7 10^-3 M\nD. 9.76 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the equilibrium constant expression for a chemical reaction:\n\nKc = [H^+][I^-] / [HI]\n\nWe know that Kc = 21 atm, [H^+] = 1 mol/L, and [I^-] = 1 mol/L. We also know that 1 mol of HI dissociates into 1 mol of H^+ and 1 mol of I^-. Therefore, the initial concentration of HI is [HI] = [H^+][I^-] = (1 mol/L)^2 = 1/1 = 1 mol/L.\n\nNow, we can use the dissociation equation:\n\nHI \u2192 H^+ + I^-\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the concentration of I^-:\n\n[I^-] = [HI] / 2\n\nSince we know that [HI] = 1 mol/L, we can calculate the molar concentration of I^-:\n\n[I^-] = 1 mol/L / 2 = 0.5 mol/L\n\nNow, we can use the equilibrium constant expression to find the molar concentration of I^- at equilibrium:\n\nKc = [H^+][I^-] / [HI]\n\nSince we know that Kc = 21 atm, [H^+] = 1 mol/L, [I^-] = 0.5 mol/L, and [HI] = 1 mol/L, we can solve for [I^-] at equilibrium:\n\n21 = (1 mol/L)^2 / [HI]\n[I^-] = 21 * [HI]\n\nWe know that [HI] = 1 mol/L, so:\n\n[I^-] = 21 * 1 mol/L = 21 mol/L\n\nHowever, this result is incorrect because the molar concentration of I^- at equilibrium cannot be greater than the molar concentration of I^- at the start (0.5 mol/L). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.00687 mol L-1",
