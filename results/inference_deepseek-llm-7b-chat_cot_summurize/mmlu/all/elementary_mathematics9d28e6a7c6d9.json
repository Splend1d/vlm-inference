Which of these could be the total number of batteries that she bought?\n\nA. 22\nB. 26\nC. 28\nD. 30\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's go through each option step by step:\n\nA. 22: If Mrs. Kinney bought 4 batteries in each pack, then we can calculate the total number of batteries by multiplying the number of packs by the number of batteries in each pack.\nNumber of packs = 22 \ufffd 4 = 5.5\nSince we can't have a fraction of a pack, this option is not correct.\n\nB. 26: Similar to option A, we calculate the total number of batteries by multiplying the number of packs by the number of batteries in each pack.\nNumber of packs = 26 \ufffd 4 = 6.5\nSince we can't have a fraction of a pack, this option is not correct.\n\nC. 28: Similar to options A and B, we calculate the total number of batteries by multiplying the number of packs by the number of batteries in each pack.\nNumber of packs = 28 \ufffd 4 = 7\nThis option is correct because Mrs. Kinney bought 4 batteries in each pack, and she bought 7 packs in total. So, she bought 7 \u00d7 4 = 28 batteries.\n\nD. 30: Similar to options A, B, and C, we calculate the total number of batteries by multiplying the number of packs by the number of batteries in each pack.\nNumber of packs = 30 \ufffd 4 = 7.5\nSince we can't have a fraction of a pack, this option is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: Mrs. Kinney bought 28 batteries in total.",
