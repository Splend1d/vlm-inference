An eigenvector of a matrix is a vector that, when subjected to the matrix's linear transformation, remains unchanged in direction (but may change in magnitude).\n\n2. The product of an invertible matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix. In other words, A * A^(-1) = I.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\nI. If v is an eigenvector of A, then 2A is also an invertible matrix. So, multiplying 2A by v will give us another eigenvector, but it will not necessarily be the same vector v.\n\nII. A^2 is the square of the matrix A. Since eigenvectors are only determined by the eigenvectors of A (and not by the eigenvalues), multiplying A^2 by an eigenvector v of A will not give another eigenvector of A^2.\n\nIII. A^(-1) is the inverse of A. Multiplying A^(-1) by an eigenvector v of A will give another eigenvector of A^(-1), which is the same as v, because A^(-1) is the inverse of A.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. III only.",
