The most prominent of these criticisms include the lack of informed consent, nonrandom sampling procedures, and the risk of psychological harm.\n\nA. Lack of Informed Consent: The Milgram study did not receive ethical approval from the Yale University Institutional Review Board, which is responsible for ensuring that research involving human subjects is conducted in an ethical manner. Additionally, participants were not fully informed about the risks and potential consequences of participating in the study.\n\nB. Nonrandom Sampling Procedures: The participants in the Milgram study were all recruited from the same local area, which means that they were not randomly selected and were not representative of the wider population. This can lead to biases and inaccuracies in the results of the study.\n\nC. Violation of Anonymity: The Milgram study involved the administration of electric shocks, which is a potentially harmful and invasive procedure. The study did not take adequate steps to protect the anonymity of the participants, which could have led to feelings of guilt and distress.\n\nD. Risk of Psychological Harm: The study involved the administration of electric shocks, which is a potentially harmful and invasive procedure. The participants were not fully informed about the potential risks and consequences of participating in the study, which could have led to feelings of distress and anxiety. Additionally, the study was conducted in a laboratory setting, which could have created a sense of pressure and stress for the participants.\n\nOverall, the Milgram study was criticized for a variety of ethical grounds, including lack of informed consent, nonrandom sampling procedures, violation of anonymity, and the risk of psychological harm.",
