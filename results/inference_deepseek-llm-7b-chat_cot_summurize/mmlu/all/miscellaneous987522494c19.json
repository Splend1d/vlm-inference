Dutch colonization in the 18th century\nD. increased commercial contacts with Indian and Arab merchants\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. increased commercial contacts with Indian and Arab merchants.\n\nIslam first spread to Indonesia through increased commercial contacts with Indian and Arab merchants. The first Muslim traders arrived in Indonesia during the 7th century, and their presence was primarily limited to the island of Java. However, with the rise of the Islamic empires in the 10th and 11th centuries, Muslim traders began to establish more permanent settlements in Indonesia. These traders introduced Islam to the indigenous peoples of the region, and the religion quickly spread throughout Indonesia. In the 16th century, the Portuguese and Dutch began to colonize Indonesia, but it was not until the 18th century that Dutch colonization had a significant impact on the spread of Islam in the region.",
