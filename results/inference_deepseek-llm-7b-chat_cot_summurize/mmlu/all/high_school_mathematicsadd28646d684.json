This means that $x-a$ and $x+20$ must be multiples of 5. \n\nIf $a$ is a multiple of 5, then $x-a$ will also be a multiple of 5. Thus, we can rewrite the first equation as $f(x-a)=f(x)$. \n\nIf $a$ is not a multiple of 5, then $x-a$ will not be a multiple of 5. In this case, we can rewrite the first equation as $f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right)=f(x)$. \n\nSince $a$ is a positive integer, $x-a$ is also a positive integer. Therefore, we can say that $f(x-a)=f(x)$ for all positive integers $x$. \n\nIn either case, we have shown that $a$ must be a multiple of 5 in order for the resulting graph to be identical to the original graph. Therefore, the smallest positive $a$ such that $a$ is a multiple of 5 is $\\boxed{5}$.",
