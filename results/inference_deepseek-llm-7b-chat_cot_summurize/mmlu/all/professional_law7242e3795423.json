The contract states that the owner was to pay the landscaper $5,000, which was intended as a graduation present for the son. Therefore, the son has a right to the payment, and he can bring an action against the owner for the $5,000.\n\nA. may be incorrect because the written contract between the owner and the landscaper did operate as a valid assignment to the son, but this does not necessarily mean the son will prevail in court.\n\nC. may be incorrect because the owner and the landscaper did not effectively modify their agreement, they simply changed the intended recipient of the payment from the landscaper's son to the landscaper himself. This does not deprive the son of any rights he may have had.\n\nD. may be incorrect because the son did provide consideration in the form of the landscaper's promise to landscape the exterior of the owner's house, which was a valuable consideration for the owner.",
