This is because the lease only contained provisions about the term of the lease and the rental amount, but did not mention anything about liability in the event of a fire. Therefore, the two tenants would not be liable for rent or any other obligations under the lease, as there was no provision regarding liability for fire in the lease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. there was nothing in the lease regarding liability for fire.",
