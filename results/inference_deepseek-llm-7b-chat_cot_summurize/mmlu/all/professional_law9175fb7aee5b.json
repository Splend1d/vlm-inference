In some jurisdictions, a construction company may be strictly liable for injuries that occur on their property due to their failure to take reasonable precautions to warn or protect others from potential hazards. This means that the construction company may be held liable for the cyclist's injuries, even if the cyclist could have foreseen the risk or assumed the risk.",
