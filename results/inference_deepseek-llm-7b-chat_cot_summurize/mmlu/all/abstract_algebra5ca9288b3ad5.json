Let's list out the elements and their sums:\n\n1. (a, 1) + (a, 1) = (2a, 2) = (0, 3)\n2. (a, 1) + (a, 3) = (4a, 4) = (0, 7)\n3. (a, 1) + (a, -1) = (2a, 0) = (0, 3)\n4. (a, 3) + (a, -3) = (2a, 0) = (0, 3)\n\nFrom this, we can see that the only element in the ring Z_3 x 3Z that adds up to zero is (0, 3). Therefore, the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x 3Z is 3.\n\nThe answer is: B. 3",
