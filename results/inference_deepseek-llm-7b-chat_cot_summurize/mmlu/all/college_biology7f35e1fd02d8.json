In a cross between a tall violet plant, with the genotype DDWw, and a dwarf white plant, what phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be expected from this cross?\n\nA. All tall violet\nB. 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet\nC. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white\nD. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white\n\nassistant:To determine the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny from this cross, we need to analyze the parental genotypes and determine the possible genotypes of the offspring.\n\nThe tall violet plant has the genotype DDWw, which means it has the tall allele (D) for plants and violet allele (W) for flower color. The dwarf white plant has the genotype ddWW, which means it has the dwarf allele (d) for plants and white allele (w) for flower color.\n\nWhen two heterozygous individuals (one tall and one dwarf) are crossed, the offspring will have a 3:1 ratio of one dominant trait to two recessive traits. In this case, the tall plant is heterozygous for plants (Dd) and the dwarf plant is heterozygous for flower color (dw).\n\nThe possible genotypes of the offspring are:\nDDWw (tall violet), Ddw (tall white), Ddd (dwarf white), and ddWW (dwarf white)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio of the offspring would be:\n1 tall violet (DDWw)\n1 tall white (Ddw)\n1 dwarf white (ddWW)\n1 dwarf white (ddWw)\n\nSo the correct answer is C. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf white: 1 dwarf white.",
