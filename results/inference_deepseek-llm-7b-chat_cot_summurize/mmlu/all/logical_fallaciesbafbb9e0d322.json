Inconsistency.\n\nIn this excerpt, E.F. Schumacher is discussing the term \"intermediate technology\" and how it was changed to \"appropriate technology\" by the organizers of an all-India conference. Schumacher acknowledges the change in terminology but does not seem to have a problem with it, as he is willing to accept both terms. The inconsistency lies in the fact that the original term \"intermediate technology\" was rejected, but the new term \"appropriate technology\" was accepted.",
