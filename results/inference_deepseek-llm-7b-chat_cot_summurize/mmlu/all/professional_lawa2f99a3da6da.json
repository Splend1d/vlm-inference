However, the collector did not fulfill his obligation to re-ship the tapestry within a reasonable time. As a result, the dealer was entitled to sell the tapestry to a third party and recover damages for the lost profit. The dealer's recovery would be limited to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% of the resale price, which in this case would be $120,000. Therefore, the collector should recover $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the resale price.",
