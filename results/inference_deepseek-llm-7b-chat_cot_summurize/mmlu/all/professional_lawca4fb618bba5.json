Also appearing on the show was a professional football player. During the course of the television show, the comedian continually referred to the player as a \"bench warmer. \" Angered by the comedian's insults, the player told him on the telecast, \"Listen, I am a starter, not a bench warmer. \"The football player sued the comedian for slander. At trial, the football player calls a witness who saw the show in question to describe what he had heard on the broadcast. The comedian's attorney objects, claiming that the witness's testimony would be hearsay. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the witness's testimony is not the best evidence.\nB. sustain the objection, because the witness does not have firsthand knowledge whether the comedian was reading from a script.\nC. overrule the objection, because defamatory statements aren't hearsay.\nD. overrule the objection, because the witness is qualified to render a lay opinion as to what he heard.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. overrule the objection, because the witness is qualified to render a lay opinion as to what he heard.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay is a statement that is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, there are some exceptions to the rule against hearsay. One of these exceptions is the \"lay opinion\" exception, which allows a witness to testify about what they heard on a broadcast if they are qualified to render a lay opinion on the matter. In this case, the football player's witness is qualified to render a lay opinion on what he heard on the television show, so the comedian's attorney's objection should be overruled.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The witness's testimony would not be hearsay if it were offered for a non-hearsay purpose, such as to show the truth of the matter asserted. The fact that the witness saw the show in question does not automatically make his testimony hearsay.\n\nB. The comedian's attorney's objection is not based on the fact that the witness does not have firsthand knowledge of whether the comedian was reading from a script. Instead, the objection is based on the fact that the witness did not have firsthand knowledge of what was said on the broadcast.\n\nC. Defamatory statements are not hearsay. If the statements made by the comedian during the television show were defamatory, they would be subject to a separate cause of action, not hearsay.",
