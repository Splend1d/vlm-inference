The roots of the polynomial are the solutions to the equation:\n\n(x - sqrt(2)*sqrt(3))^2 = 0\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\nx^2 - (2*sqrt(3) + 2)x + (2*sqrt(3) + 3) = 0\n\nThe roots of this polynomial are the solutions to the equation:\n\n2*sqrt(3) + 2 = 0\n\nSolving for sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3) = -1\n\nThe other root is:\n\nsqrt(3) + 1\n\nSince the minimal polynomial has 2 distinct roots, the degree of the field extension is 2. Therefore, the answer is C.",
