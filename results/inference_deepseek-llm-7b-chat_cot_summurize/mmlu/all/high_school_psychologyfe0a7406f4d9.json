According to the theory, the body goes through three stages in response to stress: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. The alarm stage is when the body recognizes a stressor and prepares to respond to it. The resistance stage is when the body tries to cope with the stressor and maintain homeostasis. The exhaustion stage is when the body's resources are depleted, and the body is no longer able to effectively cope with stressors. During this stage, the body is most susceptible to disease, as its ability to fight off infections and recover from stress is diminished.",
