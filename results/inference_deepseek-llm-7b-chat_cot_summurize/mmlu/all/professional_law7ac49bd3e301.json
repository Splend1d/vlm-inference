The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\n\nThe Supreme Court has consistently recognized that the right to liberty is a fundamental aspect of substantive due process, which is protected by the United States Constitution. In this case, the statute in question criminalizes a private, consensual act between two adults, which infringes upon the men's right to liberty and privacy. Furthermore, the Court has held that laws that target specific groups based on their sexual orientation are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the Supreme Court would likely find the statute unconstitutional as it violates the men's right to liberty and privacy under the United States Constitution.",
