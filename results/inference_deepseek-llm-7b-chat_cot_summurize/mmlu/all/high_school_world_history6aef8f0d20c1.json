Preference on the part of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements\nD. Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas.\n\nExplanation: In the passage provided, Senegalese poet L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor writes about New York in a highly lyrical and poetic manner, which suggests that there may have been strong transatlantic influences that linked art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas. This could be due to the increasing exchange of ideas and cultural practices between Africa, Europe, and the Americas during this time period.\n\nOption A is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of political violence or outmigration from Africa. Option C is not relevant to the passage, as it does not discuss the preferences of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements. Option D is also not supported by the passage, as the passage does not suggest a lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa.",
