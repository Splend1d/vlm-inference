During her recovery, she offered to sell her car for $450 to her neighbor, who owned a house-cleaning service. The neighbor said, \"That's great! I need a car to transport all the people who work for me to their job sites.\" In fact, the woman's car was worth $3,000, and the neighbor knew this. He was also aware that the woman had undergone surgery and noted that she seemed \"out of it\" because of the medication she was taking. Several days later, the woman's son found out about the deal and contacted the neighbor, telling him that the woman would sell him the car, but for $3,450. The next day, when the neighbor tendered $450 and demanded that the woman give him the car, she refused. If the neighbor sues the woman for breach of contract, will he be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\nB. No, because the woman put nothing in writing.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.\nD. Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.\n",

Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.\n\nassistant:The neighbor will likely be able to prevail in suing the woman for breach of contract. The reason for this is that the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable. The neighbor was aware of the woman's situation, and he still chose to accept her offer, which means that he was aware of the risks associated with the contract. Therefore, the contract can be considered enforceable.\n\nAnswer: C. Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.",
