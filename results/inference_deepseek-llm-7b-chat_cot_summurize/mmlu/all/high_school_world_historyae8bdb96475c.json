This is because the treaty states that the Parties undertake to settle any international dispute by peaceful means, and to refrain from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. This means that the United Nations is an organization that promotes peaceful resolution of disputes between nations, rather than advocating for the use of force or violence.",
