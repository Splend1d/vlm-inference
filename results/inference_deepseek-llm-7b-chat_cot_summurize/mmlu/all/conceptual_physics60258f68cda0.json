All of these.\n\nassistant:The speed of sound in air depends on several factors, including frequency and air temperature. Frequency and wavelength are related, with the speed of sound being inversely proportional to the square root of the wavelength. Therefore, the speed of sound is affected by both frequency and wavelength. Additionally, air temperature can also affect the speed of sound, as changes in temperature can cause changes in the density of the air, which in turn affects the speed of sound. Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of these.",
