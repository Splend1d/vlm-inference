This is because a reverse-biased diode acts as an open circuit, meaning it does not allow current to flow through it. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. Zener diode: A Zener diode is a special type of diode that is designed to operate in the reverse-biased mode and maintain a constant voltage level, typically around 1.2V.\nC. Capacitor: A capacitor is an electrical component that stores charge in an electric field. It is not related to the behavior of a reverse-biased diode.\nD. On Switch: This option is not related to the behavior of a reverse-biased diode.",
