It provided experimental proof of the theories of ancient thinkers, such as Aristotle, on how the universe worked.\n\nassistant:The passage about Galileo's discovery of the four Medicean planets demonstrates the use of information obtained through experimentation to conceptualize the universe. Galileo observed the stars and measured their distances using the telescope, which is an example of experimentation. This information was then used to form ideas about the universe, specifically that the planets complete their revolutions around the sun. This process of using experimentation to form ideas about the universe is best exemplified by the passage. Therefore, option C is the best answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about better scientific tools or a rise in the standard of living during the seventeenth century across Europe.\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not mention the ideas of the ancient Greeks guiding their ideas.\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not provide experimental proof of the theories of ancient thinkers, such as Aristotle, on how the universe worked. Instead, Galileo's observations and measurements formed new ideas about the universe.",
