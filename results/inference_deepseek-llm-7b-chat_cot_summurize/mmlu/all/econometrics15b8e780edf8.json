An ARMA(p,q) model has an autocorrelation function (ACF) that declines geometrically and a partial autocorrelation function (PACF) that is zero after p lags. The PACF is zero after q lags. The ACF and PACF of an ARMA(p,q) model are both declining, which is different from options A and D. Option B is incorrect because the PACF is not zero after p lags. Option D is incorrect because the ACF is not zero after q lags.",
