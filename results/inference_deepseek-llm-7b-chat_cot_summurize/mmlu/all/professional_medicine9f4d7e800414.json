Osmotic diuretic\n\nassistant:The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The patient has increased calcium excretion in their urine, which may indicate a condition called hypercalciuria. This can be caused by a deficiency in the kidney's ability to reabsorb calcium, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can help reduce calcium excretion by increasing the kidney's reabsorption of calcium.",
