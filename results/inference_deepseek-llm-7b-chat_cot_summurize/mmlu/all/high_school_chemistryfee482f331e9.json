Rinse a volumetric flask with distilled water and then pour the rinsing water into another container to avoid spills.\n2. Add 600 mL of the stock solution of H2SO4 to the volumetric flask.\n3. Fill the flask partway with water, leaving a small space between the water and the neck of the flask.\n4. Add 167 mL of the stock solution of H2SO4 to the flask, swirling the solution to mix it.\n5. Fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water, swirling the solution to ensure a uniform mixture.\n\nThe correct answer is option B.",
