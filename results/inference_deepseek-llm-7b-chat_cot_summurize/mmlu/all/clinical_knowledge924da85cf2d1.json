Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration.\n\nBronchial breathing is a characteristic feature of asthma and other respiratory diseases. It is characterized by a longer and louder inspiratory component, with a gap between inspiration and expiration. This is due to the narrowing of the airways, which causes the air to flow more slowly and with more effort. The expiratory component is usually shorter and quieter, as the airways are more relaxed during expiration.",
