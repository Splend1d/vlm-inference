Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract.

Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office.

There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\nC. The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\nD. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n\nassistant:The most accurate statement of law in this situation would be A. There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not \"run with the land.\"\n\nIn this case, the developer initially placed the restriction on mobile homes in the subdivision in each of the first 60 deeds. However, the man who subsequently placed a mobile home on his property did not purchase his lot from the developer or the builder, but rather directly from one of the original individual purchasers. Therefore, the restriction on mobile homes was not included in his deed, and it did not \"run with the land\" to his property.\n\nSince the mobile-home restriction was not included in the man's deed, it is not enforceable against him. The restriction was only included in the deeds of the original 60 lots sold by the developer and the subsequent 40 lots sold by the builder, but not in the man's deed. Consequently, the mobile-home restriction did not \"run with the land\" to his property, and he is not bound by it.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The man's deed did include the mobile-home provision, but since it did not \"run with the land,\" it is not enforceable against him.\nC. The common development scheme established for the entire subdivision does not affect the enforceability of the mobile-home restriction in this specific case.\nD. The outcome does not depend on whether a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision, but rather on whether the mobile-home restriction \"ran with the land\" to the man's property.",
