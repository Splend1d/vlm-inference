This means that even if the witness is not in court, the burden is on the party seeking to disqualify the witness to show that they made a good-faith effort to contact the witness and bring them to court. In some cases, the court may also consider whether the witness had a valid reason for not appearing in court.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.",
