Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.\n\nThis experiment would test the hypothesis that ants defend the plant by either killing or chasing away leaf-feeding insects. If the ants are removed and there is an increase in leaf damage, it would suggest that the ants are defending the tree by keeping the leaf-feeding insects away.",
