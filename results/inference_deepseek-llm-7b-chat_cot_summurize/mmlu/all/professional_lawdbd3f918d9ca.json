No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\n\nassistant:The estates of the two decedents have a strong case for prevailing on their tort claim, despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers. This is because the company had a duty to warn the squatters about the hazardous conditions on their property, especially since they were aware of the pollution in the water.\n\nUnder the doctrine of premises liability, a landowner has a duty to protect invitees, licensees, and trespassers from unreasonable dangers on their property. In this case, the squatters could be considered licensees, as they were not invited onto the property but did not have permission to be there.\n\nThe company's defense that they are only responsible for willful or wanton disregard for the safety of trespassers is not applicable in this case. The company's failure to warn the squatters about the dangerous conditions on their property constitutes a breach of their duty to protect the safety of those on their land. This breach of duty is sufficient to establish liability for the two decedents' deaths.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the company was aware of the pollution in the water and had not taken steps to address it further supports the estate's claim. The company's negligence in this regard likely contributed to the decedents' deaths, and they will likely be held liable for the resulting harm.\n\nIn conclusion, the estates of the two decedents are likely to prevail on their tort claim, as the company had a duty to protect the safety of the squatters, and their failure to do so constitutes a breach of that duty.",
