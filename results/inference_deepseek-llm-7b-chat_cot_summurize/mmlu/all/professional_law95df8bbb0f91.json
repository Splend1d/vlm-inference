Yes, because the plaintiff's previously dismissed actions asserting the same claims dismissed actions asserting the same claims operate as an adjudication on the merits.\n\nassistant:The court is likely to grant the defendant's motion. This is because the plaintiff's previously dismissed actions, which assert the same claims, operate as an adjudication on the merits. As a result, the plaintiff cannot bring a second or third action based on the same claims, as it would be an abuse of the judicial system. The plaintiff should have sought a court order dismissing the second action instead of opposing the motion to dismiss. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, because the plaintiff's previously dismissed actions asserting the same claims dismissed actions asserting the same claims operate as an adjudication on the merits.",
