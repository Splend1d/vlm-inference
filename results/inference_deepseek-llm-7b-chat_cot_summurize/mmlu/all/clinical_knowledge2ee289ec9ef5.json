This process is part of the glycolysis pathway, which is the initial step in cellular respiration. During glycogenolysis, glycogen, a complex carbohydrate stored in the liver and muscle cells, is broken down into individual glucose units (glucose molecules). These glucose units are then released into the bloodstream, where they can be used as energy by the body's cells. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose is an important process because it helps regulate the body's glucose levels, particularly during times of fasting or low carbohydrate intake.",
