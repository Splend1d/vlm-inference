Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\n\nIn a temperature-varying environment, the fluidity of the plasma membrane can be affected by the type and arrangement of lipids in the membrane. Phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails tend to increase the fluidity of the membrane, while those without double covalent bonds in their tails reduce it. By changing the ratio of these phospholipids, the bacteria or yeast cells can maintain homeostasis and adapt to the temperature changes.",
