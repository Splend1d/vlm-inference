The lowest common ancestor of vertices u and v in T is a vertex w of T such that w is an ancestor of both u and v, and no child of w is an ancestor of both u and v.

If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. II and III\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. post(u) < post(v)\nThis statement is true. In a depth-first search tree, if pre(u) < pre(v), then the postorder traversal of the tree will visit u before v. Therefore, post(u) < post(v) must be true.\n\nII. u is an ancestor of v in T.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The depth-first search tree may not include the edge (u, v), and the tree may not contain a path between u and v. Therefore, u may not be an ancestor of v in T.\n\nIII. If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The lowest common ancestor of u and v in T may not be u. For example, if T is a tree with two vertices a and b, and the edge (a, b) is not in T, then the lowest common ancestor of a and b in T is a, but a is not the lowest common ancestor of a and b in the original graph G. Therefore, we cannot conclude that w = u.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. I only. The statement I is true, but statements II and III are not necessarily true.",
