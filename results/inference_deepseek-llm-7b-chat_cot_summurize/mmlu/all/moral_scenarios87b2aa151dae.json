Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character copied answers from a book during an open book test, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because cheating on a test is dishonest and unfair to the teacher and other students.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character told their friends about their friend's crush, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, it's not necessarily morally wrong, as gossip and sharing private information can be a part of everyday social interactions. While it may be seen as wrong by some, it is not as clearly morally wrong as copying answers from a test.",
