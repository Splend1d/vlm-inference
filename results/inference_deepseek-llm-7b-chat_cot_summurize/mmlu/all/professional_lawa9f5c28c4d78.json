The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed. This is because the defendant did not intend to kill or even participate in the actual robbery, but was still convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The Supreme Court may rule that this is a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, and therefore the defendant's conviction and sentence must be overturned.",
