You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: If f is a linear function with nonzero slope, and c < d, which of the following must be FALSE?\n\nA. f (c) = f (d)\nB. f (c) \u2260 f (d)\nC. f (c) > f (d)\nD. f (c) < f (d)\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. f(c) = f(d)\nIf f is a linear function with nonzero slope, it means that as the input increases or decreases, the output also increases or decreases proportionally. Therefore, if c < d, f(c) would be a lower value than f(d). So, this option must be FALSE.\n\nB. f(c) \u2260 f(d)\nThis option is true because f(c) would be a lower value than f(d), which means they are not equal.\n\nC. f(c) > f(d)\nThis option is false because as c < d, f(c) would be a lower value than f(d).\n\nD. f(c) < f(d)\nThis option is true because as c < d, f(c) would be a lower value than f(d).\n\nSo, the answer is B. f(c) \u2260 f(d)",
