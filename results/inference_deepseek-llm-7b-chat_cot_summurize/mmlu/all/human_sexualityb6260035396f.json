This is because self-disclosure can facilitate emotional bonding and trust between partners, and can lead to increased intimacy and understanding in the relationship.\n\nA. is not supported by research. While one partner may initially be less likely to self-disclose in response to the other's disclosure, research suggests that over time, both partners are likely to engage in reciprocal self-disclosure.\n\nC. is not supported by research. In fact, research suggests that self-disclosure can positively impact relationship satisfaction. When partners feel more connected and understood through self-disclosure, they are more likely to experience satisfaction in the relationship.\n\nD. is not supported by research. There is a strong relationship between the amount of self-disclosure in a relationship and relationship satisfaction. Partners who engage in more self-disclosure tend to report higher levels of satisfaction in their relationship.",
