Which of the following research methods is she using?\n\nA. naturalistic observation\nB. survey\nC. controlled experiment\nD. quasi-experiment\n\nassistant:Jyoti is using a naturalistic observation. This is because she is observing the behavior of people in a natural setting without any manipulation or interference from the researcher. In this case, the setting is the line for tickets to rock concerts, where people are behaving naturally and without any specific instructions or stimuli. This allows Jyoti to gather data on the behavior of the participants in a real-world context.\n\nA controlled experiment would involve manipulating one or more variables to see how they affect the behavior of the participants. A survey would involve asking the participants questions to gather information. A quasi-experiment would involve a less controlled setting than a controlled experiment, but still allows for some manipulation of variables.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. naturalistic observation.",
