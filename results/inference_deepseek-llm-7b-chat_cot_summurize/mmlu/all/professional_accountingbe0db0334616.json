Cooley's corporate tax rate is 25%. What amount of the gain should be included in Cooley's net income and other comprehensive income at the end of the current year? Net income Other comprehensive income\n\nA. $100000 $0\nB. $75000 $25000\nC. $25000 $75000\nD. $0 $75000\n\nassistant:To determine the amount of the gain that should be included in Cooley's net income and other comprehensive income, we need to calculate the taxable gain. The taxable gain is calculated by subtracting the amount of the unrealized gain from the cost basis of the debt investment. Since the investment is classified as available-for-sale, the cost basis is the original cost plus any subsequent gains or losses.\n\nLet's assume the cost basis of the debt investment is $100000 plus $20000 in gains (unrealized or otherwise).\n\nTaxable gain = Unrealized gain - Cost basis\nTaxable gain = $100000 - ($100000 + $20000)\nTaxable gain = $0\n\nSince the taxable gain is $0, the entire unrealized gain of $100000 should be included in Cooley's net income and other comprehensive income at the end of the current year. Therefore, the answer is D. $0 $75000.",
