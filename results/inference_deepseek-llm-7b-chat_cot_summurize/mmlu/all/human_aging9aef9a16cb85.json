Over exercising which causes physical damage\nB. Suppression of the immune system\nC. Less eating and, in many cases, severe eating disorders\nD. Risky behaviors such as speeding and not using a seat belt\n\nassistant:The best answer for the question is B. Continued stress is damaging to health and longevity because it leads to suppression of the immune system.\n\nLong answer:\n\nThe immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body against harmful pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign invaders. When the body is under stress, it releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can suppress the immune system's ability to function properly. This suppression can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections and illnesses, and can also exacerbate existing medical conditions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because over exercising can cause physical damage, but it does not directly relate to the immune system.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while eating disorders can have negative effects on overall health, they do not directly suppress the immune system.\n\nOption D is incorrect because risky behaviors such as speeding and not wearing a seatbelt can increase the risk of accidents and injuries, but they do not directly suppress the immune system.",
