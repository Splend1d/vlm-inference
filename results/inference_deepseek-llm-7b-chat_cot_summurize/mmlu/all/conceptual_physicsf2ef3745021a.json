This phenomenon is known as constructive interference, which occurs when two or more waves meet at an angle and their waves overlap, resulting in an overall wave that has a greater amplitude than the individual waves. This is commonly seen in the pattern formed by sunlight shining through two slits, where the interference pattern results in bright and dark bands on the screen.",
