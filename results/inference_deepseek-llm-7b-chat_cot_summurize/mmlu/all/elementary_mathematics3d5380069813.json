How many gallons of gasoline would the car need to travel 144 miles?\n\nA. 6.5 gallons\nB. 6 gallons\nC. 5.5 gallons\nD. 5 gallons\n\nassistant:To find the number of gallons needed, we can divide the total miles by the miles per gallon. In this case, we have 144 miles and the car gets 24 miles per gallon. So we can calculate it as follows:\n\n144 miles / 24 miles per gallon = 6 gallons\n\nTherefore, the car would need 6 gallons of gasoline to travel 144 miles. The correct answer is B. 6 gallons.",
