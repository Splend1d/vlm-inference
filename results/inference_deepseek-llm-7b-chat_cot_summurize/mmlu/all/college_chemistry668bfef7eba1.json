What is the difference in the 13C NMR frequencies of the two compounds on a 600 MHz spectrometer?\n\nA. 7.73 kHz\nB. 30.7 kHz\nC. 91.6 kHz\nD. 122 kHz\n\nassistant:To find the difference in the 13C NMR frequencies of the two compounds on a 600 MHz spectrometer, we need to use the following formula:\n\nFrequency difference = (2 * 13C chemical shift) * (1 / (1 + 1 / (2 * spectrometer frequency)))\n\nFirst, let's calculate the frequency of each compound:\n\nFrequency of benzene = (2 * 128.4 ppm) * (1 / (1 + 1 / (2 * 600 MHz))) = 1.067 kHz\nFrequency of chloroform = (2 * 77.2 ppm) * (1 / (1 + 1 / (2 * 600 MHz))) = 0.446 kHz\n\nNow, let's find the difference in frequency:\n\nFrequency difference = (2 * 128.4 ppm) * (1 / (1 + 1 / (2 * 600 MHz))) - (2 * 77.2 ppm) * (1 / (1 + 1 / (2 * 600 MHz)))\nFrequency difference = 1.067 kHz - 0.446 kHz\nFrequency difference = 0.621 kHz\n\nThe closest answer to this result is option C: 91.6 kHz.",
