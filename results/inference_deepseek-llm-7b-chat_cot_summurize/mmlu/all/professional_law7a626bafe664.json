Where all that is available regarding intent is the use of the word \"knowingly\", the prosecution must at least prove that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or regulations.\n\nThe federal appellate court is likely to decide that the lower court's interpretation of the criminal intent required under the statute is incorrect. The court should instruct the jury that the defendant must have known his conduct was unauthorized by statute or regulations, as stated in option B. This is because the statute explicitly mentions that it is a crime for anyone to \"knowingly\" use, transfer, acquire, alter, or possess food stamps in any manner not authorized by statute or federal regulations. Therefore, the government should be able to prove that the defendant knew they were acting illegally without having to prove a specific intent.",
