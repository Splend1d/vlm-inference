Scenario 1 | The kitten could not drink on its own, so I fed it with a bottle. Scenario 2 | I borrowed a book and ripped out some pages to remember them.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong. In both scenarios, the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character takes care of a kitten by feeding it with a bottle. However, they are clearly morally wrong in stealing the kitten (or taking it without the owner's permission) and keeping it as their own. This is considered animal cruelty and theft, both of which are morally wrong actions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character borrows a book and rips out some pages to remember them. This action is morally wrong because it destroys the book's value and integrity, and violates the trust of the book owner. Stealing or damaging someone else's property is considered a morally wrong action.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, but the main character in Scenario 1 is also involved in stealing and animal cruelty, making the actions even more morally wrong than in Scenario 2.",
