N \u00b7 ~Q\n   This means N and not Q.\n\nNow let's check the consistency of the propositions set using indirect truth tables:\n\nAssume N is true.\n\nCase 1: O is true, P is true\n~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is true, ~O is false, Q is true, N \u00b7 ~Q is true. This is a consistent valuation.\n\nCase 2: O is true, P is false\n~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is true, ~O is true, Q is false, N \u00b7 ~Q is true. This is a consistent valuation.\n\nCase 3: O is false, P is true\n~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is false, ~O is true, Q is true, N \u00b7 ~Q is true. This is a consistent valuation.\n\nCase 4: O is false, P is false\n~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is false, ~O is false, Q is true, N \u00b7 ~Q is true. This is a consistent valuation.\n\nSo, for the given set of propositions, there are four consistent valuations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false.",
