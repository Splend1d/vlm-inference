Assuming that the transaction has commercial substance, what is the gain on the exchange?\n\nA. $0\nB. $5,000\nC. $30,000\nD. $35,000\n\nassistant:To calculate the gain on the exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the fair value of the machinery.\n2. Calculate the fair value of the land.\n3. Calculate the difference between the fair values of the machinery and the land.\n4. Determine the gain on the exchange.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the fair value of the machinery.\nFair value = Original cost + Depreciation\nFair value = $55,000 = $20,000 + Depreciation\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fair value of the land.\nFair value = Appraised value + Depreciation\nFair value = $50,000 = $50,000 + Depreciation\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference between the fair values of the machinery and the land.\nDifference = Fair value of machinery - Fair value of land\nDifference = $55,000 - $50,000\n\nStep 4: Determine the gain on the exchange.\nGain = Difference - Original cost of land\nGain = ($55,000 - $50,000) - $20,000\n\nGain = $5,000\n\nThe gain on the exchange is $5,000, so the correct answer is B. $5,000.",
