K-W-L chart\n\nA K-W-L chart is a teaching strategy that allows teachers to collect data on their students' prior knowledge, what they learn during a lesson, and what they still need to learn. This can be a useful tool for teachers to identify individual student needs and tailor their instruction accordingly. The other options are not specifically designed for collecting data on individual student needs:\n\nA. Concentric circles: This is a concept map technique that helps students organize and visualize their understanding of a topic, but it does not directly collect data on individual student needs.\n\nC. Book pass: This is a reading strategy in which students pass a book around the classroom and take turns reading aloud. It is not a data collection tool for individual student needs.\n\nD. Reciprocal teaching: This is a collaborative learning strategy in which students and teachers work together to improve comprehension and critical thinking skills. It is not specifically designed for collecting data on individual student needs.",
