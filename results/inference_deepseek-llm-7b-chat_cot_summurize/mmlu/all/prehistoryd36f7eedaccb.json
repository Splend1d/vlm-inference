Mesopotamians.\nB. Chavin.\nC. Chinese.\nD. Olmec.\n\nassistant:The Maya, who lived in what is now Mexico and Central America, did not derive their writing and mathematics from the Mesopotamians, the Chavin, the Chinese, or the Olmec. Instead, they developed their own unique systems for writing and mathematics based on their own cultural and historical experiences.\n\nMayan writing, called \"Mayan hieroglyphic script,\" is an ancient system of writing that was used by the Maya people from around 300 BCE to 900 CE. The writing system is made up of glyphs, or symbols, that represent sounds and ideas. The Maya also developed a sophisticated calendar system and a complex mathematical system.\n\nThe Mesopotamians, the Chavin, the Chinese, and the Olmec were all separate cultures and civilizations that existed at different times and places. The Mesopotamians were an ancient civilization that lived in the region that is now Iraq, and their writing system was called \"cuneiform.\" The Chavin were an ancient civilization that lived in what is now Peru, and their writing system is called \"Chavin script.\" The Chinese have a long and rich history of writing and mathematics, and their writing system is called \"Chinese characters.\" The Olmec were an ancient civilization that lived in what is now Mexico, and their writing system is still undeciphered.\n\nSo, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. The Maya did not derive their writing and mathematics from the Mesopotamians, the Chavin, the Chinese, or the Olmec. Instead, they developed their own unique systems for writing and mathematics based on their own cultural and historical experiences.",
