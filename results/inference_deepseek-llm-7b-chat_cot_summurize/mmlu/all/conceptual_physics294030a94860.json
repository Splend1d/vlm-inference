Both of these\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:The mutual induction of electric and magnetic fields can produce B. energy. This is because when two magnets are brought close together, they induce an electric current in each other. This process is known as electromagnetic induction. It is responsible for many of the practical applications of electricity, such as generators and transformers.",
