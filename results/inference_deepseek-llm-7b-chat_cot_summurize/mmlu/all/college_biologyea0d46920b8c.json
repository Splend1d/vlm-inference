The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics foster photosynthesis.\n\nThe tropics are characterized by warm temperatures and high levels of precipitation, which provide an optimal environment for photosynthesis. Water is essential for the growth and development of plants, and the availability of water in the tropics ensures that plants have access to the water they need to carry out photosynthesis. Additionally, the warm temperatures in the tropics promote the growth of plants, allowing them to photosynthesize more efficiently. These factors combine to create an environment in which net primary productivity tends to increase toward the tropics.",
