II and III only\n\nassistant:To answer the question, I will analyze each statement and determine which one or ones are true.\n\nI. Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\n- This statement is not true. The number of time steps required by a program is determined by the number of clock cycles and the program's complexity, not by the architecture type.\n\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\n- This statement is not entirely true. While some horizontal architectures use unencoded microinstructions, not all of them do. Some horizontal microinstructions can be encoded, depending on the specific architecture.\n\nIII. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\n- This statement is true. Horizontal microinstructions typically have a single opcode, which is followed by multiple operand specifiers that specify the data or addresses to be executed during each clock cycle.\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer is D (II and III only).",
