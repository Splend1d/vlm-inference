If the total pressure exerted by the gases is 2.0 atm, what is the partial pressure of the nitrogen?\n\nA. 0.33 atm\nB. 0.40 atm\nC. 0.50 atm\nD. 2.0 atm\n\nassistant:This problem is a mixture of ideal gas laws and stoichiometry. To solve it, we first need to find the total pressure exerted by the gases in the container, which is given as 2.0 atm. Then, we can use the ideal gas law to find the total volume of the container, which is the total pressure times the total volume. Then, we can use stoichiometry to find the total number of moles of each gas, which is the total mass of each gas divided by the molar mass of that gas. Finally, we can use the ideal gas law to find the partial pressure of each gas, which is the total pressure divided by the total number of moles of that gas.\n\nFirst, let's find the total pressure exerted by the gases in the container:\n\nTotal pressure = (Mass of nitrogen/Molar mass of nitrogen) * (Pressure of nitrogen) + (Mass of argon/Molar mass of argon) * (Pressure of argon) + (Mass of water vapor/Molar mass of water vapor) * (Pressure of water vapor)\n\nTotal pressure = (28.0 g/28.0 g/mol) * (1.01325 * 10^5 Pa) + (40.0 g/40.0 g/mol) * (1.01325 * 10^5 Pa) + (36.0 g/36.0 g/mol) * (1.01325 * 10^5 Pa)\n\nTotal pressure = 1.01325 * 10^5 Pa\n\nNext, let's find the total volume of the container:\n\nTotal volume = (Total pressure) * (1/R)\n\nTotal volume = (1.01325 * 10^5 Pa) * (1/0.29632 L atm/mol K)\n\nTotal volume = 345.47 L\n\nNow, let's find the total number of moles of each gas:\n\nTotal moles of nitrogen = (Mass of nitrogen/Molar mass of nitrogen)\n\nTotal moles of nitrogen = 28.0 g / 28.0 g/mol\n\nTotal moles of nitrogen = 1 mol\n\nTotal moles of argon = (Mass of argon/Molar mass of argon)\n\nTotal moles of argon = 40.0 g / 40.0 g/mol\n\nTotal moles of argon = 1 mol\n\nTotal moles of water vapor = (Mass of water vapor/Molar mass of water vapor)\n\nTotal moles of water vapor = 36.0 g / 36.0 g/mol\n\nTotal moles of water vapor = 1 mol\n\nFinally, let's find the partial pressure of each gas:\n\nPartial pressure of nitrogen = (Total pressure) * (1/Total moles of nitrogen)\n\nPartial pressure of nitrogen = (1.01325 * 10^5 Pa) * (1/1)\n\nPartial pressure of nitrogen = 1.01325 * 10^5 Pa\n\nPartial pressure of argon = (Total pressure) * (1/Total moles of argon)\n\nPartial pressure of argon = (1.01325 * 10^5 Pa) * (1/1)\n\nPartial pressure of argon = 1.01325 * 10^5 Pa\n\nPartial pressure of water vapor = (Total pressure) * (1/Total moles of water vapor)\n\nPartial pressure of water vapor = (1.01325 * 10^5 Pa) * (1/1)\n\nPartial pressure of water vapor = 1.01325 * 10^5 Pa\n\nTherefore, the partial pressure of the nitrogen is 0.33 atm. The answer is:\n\nA. 0.33 atm",
