The Treaty of Nanjing is a treaty between China and the British Empire, which allowed British subjects to trade freely in certain Chinese cities, and allowed British officials to act as mediators between the Chinese government and these British traders.\n\nThe answer to this question is B. Spheres of influence. This treaty created a sphere of influence for the British Empire in China, where British traders were allowed to operate freely in specific cities, and British officials were able to act as mediators between the Chinese government and these British traders. This allowed the British Empire to exert influence over trade and diplomacy in these specific areas, without creating colonies or protectorates.\n\nIt is important to note that the concessions offered in this treaty did not create British businesses, as the British traders were allowed to operate freely in these cities, but they were not directly owned by the British government.",
