This is because if the price falls below the minimum average total cost, the firm will not be able to cover its fixed costs and will incur losses. Therefore, it would be more profitable for the firm to shut down and avoid incurring these losses. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. falls below minimum average total cost.",
