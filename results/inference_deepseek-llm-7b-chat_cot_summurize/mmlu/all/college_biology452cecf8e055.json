Marine birds absorb salts from the environment through specialized salt-exchange glands and produce large volumes of concentrated urine in the kidneys.\n\nMarine birds, such as gulls and terns, have specialized salt-exchange glands called avian rectal glands. These glands allow them to absorb salts from the environment, which helps them maintain a hypoosmotic internal environment. The kidneys then concentrate the urine, resulting in large volumes of concentrated urine. This allows the birds to excrete excess solutes and maintain their osmolarity at a constant level that is hypoosmotic to seawater.",
