The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants. This means that the plumber could not change his mind about doing the work, and the contractor was entitled to rely on the plumber's bid in calculating his overall bid to the developer. When the plumber later refused to do the work, the contractor was entitled to compensation for the additional cost he incurred in hiring another plumber to complete the work. Therefore, the contractor may be able to claim $10,000 as damages for the additional cost he incurred as a result of the plumber's failure to perform.",
