The expected return on the market is 10% and the risk-free rate is 7%. Using CAPM and this stock information, what is the required rate of return for Stocks A and B, respectively?\n\nA. 9.4% and 11.2%\nB. \u22122.6% and 4.9%\nC. 4.3% and 7.4%\nD. 6.4% and 10.5%\n\nassistant:To calculate the required rate of return for Stocks A and B, we can use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM formula is:\n\nRequired Return = (Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Market Return) / (1 + Risk-Free Rate)\n\nStock A has a beta of 0.8 and Stock B has a beta of 1.4. The expected return on the market is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 7%.\n\nFor Stock A:\nRequired Return = (7% + 0.8 * 10%) / (1 + 7%)\nRequired Return = (7% + 8%) / (1 + 7%)\nRequired Return = 15.1% / 1.71%\nRequired Return = 8.8566 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nFor Stock B:\nRequired Return = (7% + 1.4 * 10%) / (1 + 7%)\nRequired Return = (7% + 14%) / (1 + 7%)\nRequired Return = 21.1% / 1.71%\nRequired Return = 12.3764 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nThe required rate of return for Stock A is approximately 8.86%, and the required rate of return for Stock B is approximately 12.38%.\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match these values.
