Both Samoset and Squanto played important roles in helping the English settlers in their respective regions, just as Tecumseh played a significant role in defending his people and their lands from American expansion.\n\nCrazy Horse and Sacagawea are also important figures in American history, but they are associated with different events and periods than Samoset and Squanto. Crazy Horse was a leader of the Lakota people during the American Indian Wars, while Sacagawea was a Shoshone woman who served as a guide and translator for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Geronimo, a prominent leader of the Apache tribe, was active during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, while Samoset and Squanto lived centuries earlier.",
