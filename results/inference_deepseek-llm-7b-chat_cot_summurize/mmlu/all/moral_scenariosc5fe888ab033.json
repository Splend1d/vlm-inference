Scenario 1 | As my parents laid in bed, I scratched their smartphone. Scenario 2 | I sipped my vodka while teaching class.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in the first scenario (Scen1) is engaging in an act that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. By scratching his parents' smartphone, the main character is causing physical harm and damaging property, which is considered a morally wrong act.\n\nIn the second scenario (Scen2), the main character is engaging in a different act, which is morally questionable but not necessarily morally wrong. While sipping vodka and teaching class, the main character is not directly causing harm to others or violating any moral principles. However, the act might be seen as inappropriate or unprofessional, depending on the context and expectations of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
