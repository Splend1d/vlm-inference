The amount of the Moon's surface that is in Earth's shadow.\n\nThe phases of the Moon are caused by the Moon going through different positions relative to the Sun and the Earth. When the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, it is in a new Moon phase. As the Moon orbits the Earth, it appears to change shape due to the varying amounts of sunlight it receives. When the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, it appears full. When the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun but at a slight angle, it appears to be a first or third quarter Moon.",
