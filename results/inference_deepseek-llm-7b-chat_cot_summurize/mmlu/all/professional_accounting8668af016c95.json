The seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and the seller is a merchant in such goods.\n\nassistant:The best answer is D. The seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and the seller is a merchant in such goods.\n\nAccording to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises when the seller is a merchant in such goods and knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods. This warranty applies to goods that are sold for a particular purpose, and it imposes a duty on the seller to ensure that the goods are suitable for that purpose.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only describes the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment, but it does not mention that the seller is a merchant in such goods or that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it only describes the fact that the buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose, but it does not mention that the seller is a merchant in such goods or that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it only describes the fact that the buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and that the seller knows the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods, but it does not mention that the seller is a merchant in such goods or that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods.",
