With which of the following conflicts is she faced?\n\nA. frustration-aggression\nB. intrinsic-extrinsic\nC. approach-avoidance\nD. approach-approach\n\nassistant:Delia is faced with the conflict described in option B: intrinsic-extrinsic.\n\nIntrinsic-extrinsic conflicts occur when an individual is torn between two options that are driven by different motivations or values. In this case, Delia is faced with choosing between two prestigious universities, Harvard and Yale. Both universities offer excellent educational opportunities, but the decision is not solely based on the academic quality of the institutions.\n\nDelia is likely considering factors such as location, student life, extracurricular activities, and other personal preferences. These factors are intrinsic to her decision-making process because they directly affect her experience at the university. On the other hand, factors such as reputation, rankings, and prestige are extrinsic to her decision, as they are more concerned with the external perception of the university rather than her personal experience.\n\nAs Delia considers both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors, she faces an intrinsic-extrinsic conflict. She must weigh her personal preferences and values against the social and academic prestige associated with each institution. This conflict can be emotionally challenging for her, as it involves making a decision that will significantly impact her future.\n\nIn conclusion, Delia is faced with an intrinsic-extrinsic conflict when deciding between attending Harvard University or Yale University. This type of conflict is common in situations where individuals must choose between two options driven by different motivations or values.",
