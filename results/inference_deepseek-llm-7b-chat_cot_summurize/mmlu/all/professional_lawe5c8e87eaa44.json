The prosecution must prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, not just one element based on circumstantial evidence. The fact that four matches were missing from the matchbook could be seen as circumstantial evidence, but it is not enough to prove the defendant's intent to set the fire beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury should be able to make its own decision based on the evidence presented in court, not be instructed by the judge on what they should infer from the evidence.",
