Supply refers to the amount of a particular good or service that is available for sale, while demand refers to the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase. When supply and demand are in balance, prices tend to be stable. However, when supply is greater than demand, prices tend to decrease, and when demand is greater than supply, prices tend to increase. This system helps to allocate resources efficiently and allows for the efficient allocation of goods and services in a free market.",
