An increase in the money supply.\nB. Contractionary demand management policies.\nC. Expansionary demand management policies.\nD. An increase in government spending.\n\nassistant:A. An increase in the money supply.\n\nAn increase in the money supply could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. This is because a larger money supply means that each unit of money has less purchasing power, which in turn leads to a decrease in the overall demand for goods and services in the economy. As a result, the aggregate demand curve would shift to the left, indicating a decrease in the equilibrium level of output and a decline in the price level.",
