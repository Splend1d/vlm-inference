By analyzing the frequency of the star's light, astronomers can determine the presence of a planet and even measure its size and orbit.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the shift of the star's position against the sky due to the planet's gravitational pull is not a reliable method for detecting the presence of a planet.\n\nOption C is incorrect because detecting a planet ejected from a binary star system is not a common method for discovering new planets.\n\nOption D is incorrect because detecting the starlight reflected off the planet is not a reliable method for detecting the presence of a planet.",
