Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nThe other options are not entirely accurate or do not capture the essence of Socrates' view on the difference between appearances and reality. A. is not entirely correct because Socrates does not believe that what is right or wrong, true or false varies from one culture to another. B. is not accurate because Socrates does not believe that appearances are the only way we have for knowing reality. D. is not entirely correct because while Socrates does believe in objective principles for thought and action, he also believes that these principles are not necessarily the same for everyone and that they can be discovered through dialectical inquiry.",
