Leucine, cysteine and glycine are all essential amino acids that should be included in the diet. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and there are 20 different amino acids that the body needs to function properly. However, some of these amino acids cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained through the diet. These are called essential amino acids, and include leucine, cysteine, and glycine.",
