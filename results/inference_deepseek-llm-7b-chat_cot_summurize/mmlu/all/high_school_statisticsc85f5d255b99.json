How many students should be sampled to get a 90 percent confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08?\n\nA. 27\nB. 64\nC. 106\nD. 423\n\nassistant:To determine the appropriate sample size for the given situation, we need to calculate the required sample size for the t-distribution with a given confidence level and margin of error. We can use the formula:\n\nn = (Z^2 * \u03c3^2) / E^2\n\nwhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the t-score for the desired confidence level (90 percent) and level of precision (0.08)\n- \u03c3 is the population standard deviation\n- E is the desired margin of error\n\nSince we don't have the population standard deviation (\u03c3), we can assume a value for it. A common value for the population standard deviation is 15. We can also assume that the population proportion is 0.5, as this is the most common case when estimating a proportion.\n\nLet's calculate the sample size for each option:\n\nA. 27:\nn = (2.30 / 15^2) * 0.5^2\nn = 0.02 / 289 * 0.25\nn \u2248 0.00037\n\nB. 64:\nn = (2.30 / 15^2) * 0.5^2\nn = 0.02 / 289 * 0.25\nn \u2248 0.00037\n\nC. 106:\nn = (2.30 / 15^2) * 0.5^2\nn = 0.02 / 289 * 0.25\nn \u2248 0.00037\n\nD. 423:\nn = (2.30 / 15^2) * 0.5^2\nn = 0.02 / 289 * 0.25\nn \u2248 0.00037\n\nAs we can see, none of the options provide a sample size that meets the desired margin of error (0.08). Therefore, we need to choose a different approach to solve the problem.\n\nLet's use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to calculate the required sample size. The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample proportion will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough.\n\nLet's assume a sample size of n = 200. Under the 90 percent confidence level, we can calculate the t-score as:\n\nt = Z * sqrt(p * (1-p) / n)\n\nwhere:\n- p is the sample proportion\n- Z is the t-score for the desired confidence level (90 percent)\n- n is the sample size\n\nWe can use the t-distribution table or calculator to find the corresponding t-score for a 90 percent confidence level and a margin of error of 0.08.\n\nOnce we have the t-score, we can calculate the sample proportion (p) using the formula:\n\np = (number of successes) / (number of successes + number of failures)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the required sample size using the formula we derived earlier:\n\nn = (t^2 * \u03c3^2) / E^2\n\nWe can plug in the values and solve for the sample size. However, this approach may not provide the most accurate result, as it assumes that the population standard deviation (\u03c3) is the same as the sample standard deviation. In practice, it is better to use a more accurate method, such as simulation or bootstrapping, to estimate the required sample size.\n\nSo, without more information about the population, we cannot definitively determine the correct sample size for the given problem.",
