Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in Scenario 1 (turned in the dirty towels at a hotel) is doing something that could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is typically expected for guests to leave the towels in the room for cleaning staff to clean. In Scenario 2, the main character is keeping their whiskey bottles out of reach of their 3-year-old son, which is a responsible action and not considered morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.",
