The government will have to cut spending on important programs to close the gap.\n\nHere's how I arrived at this answer:\n\nFiscal policy is a tool used by the government to manage the economy. When the government wants to stimulate economic growth, it can use expansionary fiscal policy, which involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes. This can help to increase aggregate demand and encourage businesses to hire more workers and invest in new projects.\n\nOn the other hand, when the government wants to reduce the size of the economy, it can use contractionary fiscal policy, which involves decreasing government spending or increasing taxes. This can help to reduce aggregate demand and encourage businesses to slow down their hiring and investment.\n\nIn the case of closing a recessionary gap, the government would use contractionary fiscal policy. This means that it would reduce government spending and/or increase taxes to reduce the size of the economy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while unemployment might rise as a result of fiscal policy, it is not necessarily a drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap. In fact, the government might hope to stimulate employment by increasing government spending.\n\nOption B is incorrect because raising taxes would actually increase the size of the economy, not reduce it. This would not be consistent with a goal of closing a recessionary gap.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the equilibrium price level is not necessarily affected by fiscal policy. The price level is determined by the overall supply and demand for goods and services in the economy, not by government spending or taxation decisions.",
