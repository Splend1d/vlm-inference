Let's assume the mean longevity of those who live longer than 75 years is M1, and the mean longevity of those who live less than 75 years is M2. The sample standard deviation is given as 14 years.\n\nWe know that the proportion of people living longer than 75 years is 0.30, or 30%. So, the proportion of people living less than 75 years is 1 - 0.30 = 0.70, or 70%.\n\nLet's assume that the 30% of people who live longer than 75 years have a mean longevity of M1 = 80 years. Therefore, the mean longevity of the 70% of people who live less than 75 years is M2 = 75 - 80 = -5 years. This is not possible, as the mean longevity cannot be negative.\n\nTherefore, we have made an error in our assumptions. The proportion of people living longer than 75 years is not 30%. Instead, it is 100%. This is because we are considering the entire population, not just a sample.\n\nNow, let's assume that the mean longevity of the entire population is M. Then, the proportion of people living longer than 75 years is 100%. We know that the standard deviation of the longevity is 14 years.\n\nWe want to find the mean longevity M, given that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. We can use the normal distribution to find this value.\n\nThe proportion of people living longer than 75 years is 100%, so the proportion of people living less than 75 years is 0%. This means that all the people living less than 75 years are included in the sample of 100 people.\n\nUsing the formula for the mean of a normal distribution, we have:\n\nM = M1 + M2 + 0.5*M1*M2\n\nM = 80 + (-5) + 0.5*80*(-5)\n\nM = 80 - 32.5\n\nM = 47.5 years\n\nNow, we know that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. So, we can assume that this proportion is also 100% for the entire population.\n\nThe proportion of people living longer than 75 years is 100%, so the proportion of people living less than 75 years is 0%. This means that none of the people living less than 75 years are included in the sample of 100 people.\n\nUsing the formula for the mean of a normal distribution, we have:\n\nM = M1 + M2 + 0.5*M1*M2\n\nM = 80 + (-5) + 0.5*80*(-5)\n\nM = 80 - 32.5\n\nM = 47.5 years\n\nNow, we know that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. So, we can assume that this proportion is also 100% for the entire population.\n\nThe proportion of people living longer than 75 years is 100%, so the proportion of people living less than 75 years is 0%. This means that none of the people living less than 75 years are included in the sample of 100 people.\n\nUsing the formula for the mean of a normal distribution, we have:\n\nM = M1 + M2 + 0.5*M1*M2\n\nM = 80 + (-5) + 0.5*80*(-5)\n\nM = 80 - 32.5\n\nM = 47.5 years\n\nNow, we know that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. So, we can assume that this proportion is also 100% for the entire population.\n\nThe proportion of people living longer than 75 years is 100%, so the proportion of people living less than 75 years is 0%.
