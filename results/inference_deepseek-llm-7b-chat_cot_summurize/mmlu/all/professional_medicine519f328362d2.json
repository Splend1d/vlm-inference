He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet. All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?\n\nA. Amputation\nB. Application of topical collagenase\nC. Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes\nD. Hyperbaric oxygen\n\nassistant:The most appropriate treatment for this patient would be C. Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes. This would involve removing the dead tissue from the affected toes to prevent further infection and promote healing.\n\nAmputation (A) is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of severe tissue damage or infection. Application of topical collagenase (B) is not a standard treatment for frostbite or necrotizing fasciitis, and hyperbaric oxygen (D) may not be effective in this case, as the patient is already receiving rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet.",
