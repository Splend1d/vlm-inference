The machine had an estimated useful life of eight years and a salvage value of $60000. Hall chose to depreciate the machine using the double- declining balance method. What was the carrying amount of the machine in Hall's balance sheet at the end of its second year of operations?\n\nA. $60,000\nB. $61,250\nC. $78,750\nD. 80000\n\nassistant:To find the carrying amount of the machine at the end of its second year of operations, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and add it to the original cost.\n\nYear 1:\nDouble-Declining Balance Method:\n- Annual depreciation = 1/8 * ($140,000 - $60,000) = $15,000\n- Total depreciation for the year = $15,000\n- Carrying amount at the end of the year = $140,000 - $15,000 = $125,000\n\nYear 2:\n- Annual depreciation = 1/8 * ($125,000 - $60,000) = $12,500\n- Total depreciation for the year = $12,500\n- Carrying amount at the end of the year = $125,000 - $12,500 = $112,500\n\nThe carrying amount of the machine in Hall's balance sheet at the end of its second year of operations is $112,500. The closest answer to this is option C, $78,750, but it is not the correct answer.",
