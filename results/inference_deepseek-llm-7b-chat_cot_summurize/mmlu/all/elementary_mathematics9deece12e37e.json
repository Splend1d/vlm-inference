At this rate, how much will a bucket of 100 golf balls cost?\n\nA. $10.00 \nB. $10.50 \nC. $13.50 \nD. $16.00\n\nassistant:To calculate the cost of a bucket of 100 golf balls, we can use the given rate of $4.00 for 40 golf balls as a proportion. The cost of 1 golf ball is $4.00 / 40 = $0.10. Therefore, the cost of 100 golf balls is 100 * $0.10 = $10.00.\n\nThe correct answer is A. $10.00.",
