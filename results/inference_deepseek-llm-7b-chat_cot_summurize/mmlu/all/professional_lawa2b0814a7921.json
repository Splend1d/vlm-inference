The letter stated, \"I want to sell my antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. If you are interested please contact me.\" Three days later Bobby sent a letter to Susan stating \"I agree to pay your asking price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster.\" The next day Susan sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. If Bobby brings suit against Susan for breach of contract, the likely outcome is\n\nA. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mail box rule.\nB. For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\nC. For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\nD. For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n\nassistant:The likely outcome of Bobby bringing suit against Susan for breach of contract is A. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mailbox rule.\n\nIn this scenario, Susan sent an email to Bobby, stating that she wants to sell her antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000, and Bobby replied to Susan's email three days later, stating that she agrees to pay the asking price of $20,000. Bobby's response is considered an acceptance of Susan's offer, and it was delivered to Susan within the time period specified in the email. Therefore, Bobby's acceptance was timely under the mailbox rule.\n\nThe mailbox rule states that an offer becomes a binding contract when it is delivered to the offeree, and the offeree's acceptance of the offer is deemed to have been delivered at the same time and place as the offer. In this case, Susan's email was sent to Bobby, and Bobby's response was delivered to Susan within the time period specified in the email. Therefore, Bobby's acceptance was considered to have been delivered at the same time and place as Susan's email, and the contract between Susan and Bobby was formed at that time.\n\nHowever, Susan later sold the car to Harriet for $25,000. This sale was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted her offer. Therefore, Susan may be in breach of contract. However, Bobby may also be in breach of contract, as she accepted Susan's offer after Susan had already made a new offer to Harriet.\n\nIn conclusion, the likely outcome of Bobby bringing suit against Susan for breach of contract is A. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mailbox rule. However, both parties may be in breach of contract, and the outcome of the lawsuit may depend on the specific terms of the contract and the actions of both parties.",
