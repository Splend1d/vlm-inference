One of the State's witnesses is Sally. Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is\n\nA. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\nB. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\nC. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\nD. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\n\nassistant:A. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\n\nSally's conviction for vehicular homicide is relevant evidence that can be used to impeach her credibility as a witness. Impeachment refers to the process of challenging a witness's credibility by introducing evidence that may discredit the witness. In this case, the fact that Sally has a prior conviction for a crime that carries a maximum penalty of more than one year could be used to suggest that she may have a motive to lie or provide false testimony in order to protect the former police officer being prosecuted. Therefore, the evidence of Sally's conviction is admissible to impeach her at trial.\n\nB. is incorrect because Sally's plea of nolo contendere does not necessarily mean she did not admit guilt. Nolo contendere is a Latin phrase that means \"no contest,\" and it is a plea of guilty without admitting guilt. Therefore, even though Sally did not admit guilt, her plea of nolo contendere could still be used to impeach her credibility as a witness.\n\nC. is incorrect because the fact that Sally received a suspended sentence does not necessarily mean that her conviction is not relevant to her credibility as a witness. The fact that she received a suspended sentence could be used to suggest that she may have a motive to lie or provide false testimony in order to protect the former police officer being prosecuted.\n\nD. is incorrect because Sally is a witness and not the criminal defendant. As a witness, she can still be impeached by evidence of her prior conviction.",
