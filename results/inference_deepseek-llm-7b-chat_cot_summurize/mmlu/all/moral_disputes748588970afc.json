It assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts.\n\nAccording to Aldo Leopold, a conservation system based wholly on economic motives assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts. This means that the system does not consider the non-economic values and ecological processes that are essential for the long-term health of the biotic system. For example, an economic system might focus on maximizing profits from timber or wildlife, but it would not take into account the importance of preserving habitat for other species or maintaining the integrity of ecosystems. Without considering these non-economic values, the system is likely to fail in the long run, as it does not address the full range of factors that are important for the health and sustainability of the biotic system.",
