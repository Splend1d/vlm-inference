This is because the fixed costs of the firm are spread across a large number of units, and the firm can take advantage of economies of scale to produce at a lower cost per unit.\n\nHowever, if the government were to regulate the output of the natural monopoly, it would want to ensure that the firm produces an allocatively efficient level of output. Allocative efficiency occurs when the quantity produced is such that the total value of the good or service produced is equal to the total value of the resources used to produce it.\n\nIn a natural monopoly, the marginal cost of producing one additional unit is equal to the marginal cost of producing the next unit. This is because the firm has already incurred the fixed costs of production and can therefore produce at a constant marginal cost.\n\nTherefore, if the government were to regulate the output of a natural monopoly so that it produces an allocatively efficient level of output, it would want to ensure that the price is equal to marginal cost. This would ensure that the firm is producing an optimal level of output, maximizing social welfare.",
