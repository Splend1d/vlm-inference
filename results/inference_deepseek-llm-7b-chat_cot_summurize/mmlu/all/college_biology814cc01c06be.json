Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\nB. Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species.\nC. An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\nD. A human embryo displays features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species. This conclusion is justified because embryologists study the development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus, and they would observe that early embryos of different species share similar features in their development.\n\nA. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny is a controversial theory that suggests that the course of individual development (ontogeny) resembles the evolutionary history of the species (phylogeny). However, it is not directly related to the development of a vertebrate organism from the zygote stage to fetus.\n\nC. An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos is partially correct. While it is true that early human embryos share some features with early fish and avian embryos, the conclusion should be more specific to the class, order, and species of the vertebrate organism being studied.\n\nD. A human embryo displays features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development is not the same as option B. This statement suggests that human embryos have features of adult fish and birds, while option B states that early embryos have features in common with their class, order, and species, regardless of whether they are adults or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species.",
