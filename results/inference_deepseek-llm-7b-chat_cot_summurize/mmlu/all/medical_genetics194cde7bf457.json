All of these.\n\nIntergenerational transmission refers to the transfer of traits or experiences from one generation to the next. In the context of the question, parental exposures to war, natural disasters, and hunger can all lead to negative consequences for their offspring. For example, exposure to war can lead to psychological trauma that is passed down to future generations, while exposure to natural disasters can result in physical harm or loss of resources that can impact the health and well-being of offspring. Similarly, exposure to hunger can lead to malnutrition and other health problems that can affect the next generation.",
