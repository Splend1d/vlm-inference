Let L be the set of strings in {0, 1}^* such that x \\in L if and only if the number of 0's in x is divisible by k and the number of 1's in x is odd.

The pumping lemma states that if there exists a language L that can be recognized by a DFA with fewer than or equal to n states, then for any string s in L, there exists an integer p such that s can be divided into three non-empty strings: x, y, and z, where |y| >= p, and the following conditions hold:\n\n1. |y| * |z| >= |s|\n2. yz is in L\n3. For all i >= 0, the substring z^(i*p) is in L\n\nIn our case, we want to find the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes L. Let's consider the conditions:\n\n1. If |y| * |z| >= |s|, then the number of 0's in x or the number of 1's in x will be divisible by k. Since the number of 0's in x is divisible by k, the number of 1's in x must be odd. Therefore, the DFA will recognize L.\n\n2. If yz is in L, then the number of 0's in y or the number of 1's in y will be divisible by k. Since the number of 0's in y is divisible by k, the number of 1's in y must be odd. Therefore, the DFA will recognize L.\n\n3. If z^(i*p) is in L for all i >= 0, then the number of 0's in z^(i*p) or the number of 1's in z^(i*p) will be divisible by k. Since the number of 0's in z^(i*p) is divisible by k, the number of 1's in z^(i*p) must be odd. Therefore, the DFA will recognize L.\n\nSince the pumping lemma states that if there exists a language L that can be recognized by a DFA with fewer than or equal to n states, then for any string s in L, there exists an integer p such that s can be divided into three non-empty strings: x, y, and z, where |y| >= p, and the following conditions hold, we can conclude that the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes L is k + 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. k + 2.",
