It consists of several principles that must be considered in order to determine whether a war is just or not. The first of these principles is jus ad bellum, which refers to the considerations that must be made before engaging in a war. This includes whether the war is necessary, if other peaceful alternatives have been exhausted, and whether the war is just and proportionate.\n\nThe second principle of the Just War Theory is jus in bello, which refers to the moral rules that govern the conduct of a war. This includes prohibitions against attacking civilians, destroying undefended property, and using torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nTherefore, the principle of military necessity, which is one of the key elements of the Just War Theory, belongs to both jus ad bellum and jus in bello.",
