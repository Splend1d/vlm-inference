These pathways help plants convert sunlight into energy. Changes in plant communities that were associated with the diets of ancient hominids, such as humans, indicate that their diets also changed over time.\n\nOption A is correct because ancient hominids, such as early humans, were originally focused on grasses, which were the primary food source for these early humans. However, as plant communities evolved and changed due to the C3 and C4 pathways, the diets of ancient hominids also shifted to include more nuts and fruits. This is a transition from a species focused on grasses to one that includes nuts and fruits.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the transition in the diets of ancient hominids was not from meat to fruits and vegetables. Instead, they shifted from a primarily grass-based diet to one that included more nuts and fruits.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that ancient hominids shifted from a diet of nuts and fruits to a diet of fish.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the transition in the diets of ancient hominids was not from nuts and fruits to a species more focused on grasses. Instead, they shifted from a primarily grass-based diet to one that included more nuts and fruits.",
