Muslim missionaries who came from Southern Africa.\nB. Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara.\nC. Berber armies who conquered the former kingdom of Ghana.\nD. Pressure from Christian Ethiopia caused the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies.\n\nassistant:The spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali is best accounted for by trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara. This is based on the information provided by Al-Zawawi, which describes the trade relations between the kingdom of Mali and the pagan nation of Sudan. The fact that the kingdom of Mali sends copper ingots to Sudan and receives gold in return indicates a significant trade connection between the two regions. This trade connection likely facilitated the spread of Islam to Mali through merchants and travelers who were either Muslim themselves or were exposed to Islam during their travels.\n\nThe other options provided do not seem to be the main factors that led to the spread of Islam to Mali. Muslim missionaries from Southern Africa do not seem to have had a significant impact on the spread of Islam in West Africa, as there is no evidence to suggest that they played a major role in this process. Berber armies who conquered the former kingdom of Ghana do not seem to be the main factor either, as the kingdom of Mali was already established and had its own traditions and beliefs before the arrival of the Berbers. Finally, pressure from Christian Ethiopia does not seem to be a significant factor in the spread of Islam to Mali, as the two regions were not in direct contact with each other and there is no evidence to suggest that the king of Mali sought Muslim allies due to pressure from Ethiopia.",
