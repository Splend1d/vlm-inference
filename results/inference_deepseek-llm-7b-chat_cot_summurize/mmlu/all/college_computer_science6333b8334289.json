We can express this condition using the given inequality options.\n\nOption A: There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time. This option is incorrect.\n\nOption B: 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y\nSince this option involves ratios of the row and column sizes, it is a valid inequality to compare the two methods' time complexities.\n\nOption C: x > y\nThis option is not related to the time complexity of matrix multiplication.\n\nOption D: 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\nThis option is not related to the time complexity of matrix multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y",
