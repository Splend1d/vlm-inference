A relation R on a set A is symmetric if xRy implies yRx for all x, y in A. An anti-symmetric relation is one that is symmetric and also satisfies xRy and yRx implies x = y for all x, y in A. An equivalence relation is a relation that is both symmetric and anti-symmetric and also satisfies the additional property that the relation holds for all pairs of elements in A.\n\nLet's analyze the given relation S:\n\nS = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}\n\n1. Symmetry:\nIf xRy, then (1, 1) is in S, and (2, 2) is in S. So, S is symmetric.\n\n2. Anti-symmetry:\nIf xRy and yRx, then (1, 1) and (2, 2) are both in S. However, since both (1, 1) and (2, 2) are in S, we have a contradiction. Therefore, S is not anti-symmetric.\n\n3. Equivalence:\nSince S is not anti-symmetric, it cannot be an equivalence relation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\nD. an equivalence relation",
