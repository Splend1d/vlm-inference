We wish to produce clusters of many different sizes and shapes. Which of the following methods is the most appropriate?\n\nA. Decision Trees\nB. Density-based clustering\nC. Model-based clustering\nD. K-means clustering\n\nassistant:B. Density-based clustering is the most appropriate method for clustering spatial data such as the geometrical locations of houses. Density-based clustering algorithms consider the density of data points in a region and group points with similar densities together. This method is useful when clusters have varying sizes and shapes, as it can handle different densities within a cluster.",
