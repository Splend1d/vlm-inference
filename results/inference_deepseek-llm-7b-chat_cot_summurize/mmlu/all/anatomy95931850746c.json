Anterior fragment to be displaced downwards by the action of the digastric muscle.\n\nWhen a patient suffers an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible, the anterior fragment is usually displaced downwards by the action of the digastric muscle. This is because the digastric muscle, which is responsible for elevating the mandible, can exert a force on the anterior fragment, causing it to move downwards.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for rotating the mandible, not displacing the fragments. Option C is incorrect because the temporalis muscle is responsible for moving the mandible forward and backward, not displacing the fragments. Option D is incorrect because the medial pterygoid muscle is responsible for protruding the mandible, not displacing the fragments.",
