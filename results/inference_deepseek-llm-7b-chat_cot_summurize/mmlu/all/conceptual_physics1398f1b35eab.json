The heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration because the\n\nA. force due to gravity is the same on each.\nB. air resistance is always zero in free fall.\nC. inertia of both rocks is the same.\nD. ratio of force to mass is the same.\n\nassistant:A. force due to gravity is the same on each.\n\nExplanation: In free fall, both the heavy rock and the light rock experience the same force due to gravity, which is equal to the weight of the rock. Since the force due to gravity is the same on each rock, their accelerations are also the same. The other options (B, C, and D) do not directly relate to acceleration.",
