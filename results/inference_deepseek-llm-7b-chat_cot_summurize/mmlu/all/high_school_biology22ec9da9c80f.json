Females inspect the bowers and, if suitably impressed, allow males to mate with them. The evolution of this male behavior is due to\n\nA. frequency-dependent selection.\nB. artificial selection.\nC. sexual selection.\nD. natural selection.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Sexual selection. This is the process by which males compete for the attention of females through displays of their physical characteristics, such as the elaborate bowers they build. The females then evaluate the displays and choose the males with the most impressive displays to mate with. This process is driven by the desire of the males to increase their chances of passing on their genes. The other options (A, B, and D) are incorrect because they refer to different types of selection that do not apply to this situation. Frequency-dependent selection is the idea that the frequency of a trait is influenced by the fitness effects of that trait. Artificial selection is the process of humans selecting plants or animals based on specific traits. Natural selection is the process of natural selection, where traits that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on to the next generation.",
