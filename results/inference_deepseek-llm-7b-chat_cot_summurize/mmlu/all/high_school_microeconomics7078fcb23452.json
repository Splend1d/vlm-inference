The ability for firms to enter and exit a market over time means that the long run supply curve is more elastic. This is because when firms enter the market, they increase the supply of goods or services. Similarly, when firms exit the market, they decrease the supply of goods or services. This fluctuation in the number of firms in the market causes the long run supply curve to be more elastic, meaning it is more responsive to changes in the market conditions.",
