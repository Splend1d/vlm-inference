The hit-and-run statute in question requires the driver involved in an accident to disclose their name, address, and driver's license to the police or other persons at the scene. While this may seem to implicate the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination, the disclosure requirement is not sufficiently testimonial to trigger that protection.\n\nThe defendant's argument that the statute violates his privilege against self-incrimination is not valid. The privilege against self-incrimination, also known as the Fifth Amendment, protects individuals from being forced to provide incriminating evidence against themselves. However, the disclosure requirement of the hit-and-run statute does not amount to incrimination. Rather, it is a requirement to provide information that is necessary to aid in the investigation and prosecution of the crime.\n\nFurthermore, the legislative intent in enacting the statute was not designed to require disclosure of information to be used primarily in civil litigation. The purpose of the statute is to ensure that drivers involved in accidents provide necessary information to aid in the investigation and prosecution of the crime, and to deter hit-and-run incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, the defendant's motion to dismiss should be denied. The disclosure requirement of the hit-and-run statute does not implicate the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination, and the legislative intent in enacting the statute was not designed to require disclosure of information to be used primarily in civil litigation.",
