Aurignacian technology was focused on the production of hand axes.\n\nassistant:Aurignacian technology differed from Mousterian technology in several ways. One of the main differences was in the types of tools they produced. Mousterian technology produced a greater variety of tools, including points, blades, and choppers, while Aurignacian technology focused more on producing hand axes. Another difference was in the types of raw materials they used. Mousterian technology often used flint or quartz, while Aurignacian technology used a wider range of materials, including bone, antler, and ivory. Additionally, Aurignacian technology was often more polished and refined, while Mousterian technology was rougher and more utilitarian.",
