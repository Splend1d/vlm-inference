What is the P-value of this test?\n\nA. 1.06\nB. 0.1446\nC. 0.2275\nD. 0.8554\n\nassistant:To find the P-value of this test, we can use the z-test statistic and the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe z-test statistic is calculated as:\n\nz = (x\u0304 - p) / sqrt(s^2 / n)\n\nwhere x\u0304 is the sample mean, p is the hypothesized population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, x\u0304 = 0.35, p = 0.3, and s = sqrt(sum(xi - x\u0304)^2 / (n - 1)).\n\nFirst, we need to find the sample standard deviation:\n\ns = sqrt(sum(xi - x\u0304)^2 / (n - 1))\ns = sqrt((0.35 - 0.3)^2 + (0.35 - 0.35)^2 + ... + (xi - 0.35)^2) / (95 - 1)\ns = sqrt(0.005 + 0.005 + ... + 0.005) / 94\ns = sqrt(0.005 * 94) / 94\ns = sqrt(0.047) / 94\ns \u2248 0.0908\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-test statistic:\n\nz = (0.35 - 0.3) / sqrt(0.0908 * (95 / 94))\nz \u2248 0.2902\n\nNext, we need to find the P-value associated with this z-value using the standard normal distribution. We can look this up in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator.\n\nP-value \u2248 0.1446\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0.1446.",
