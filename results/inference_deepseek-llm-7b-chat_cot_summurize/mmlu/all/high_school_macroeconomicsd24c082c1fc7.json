Higher spending \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Higher taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lowering the discount rate\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Higher spending \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lower taxes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sell Treasury securities.\n\nDuring a recessionary gap, fiscal and monetary policymakers can combine spending, tax, and monetary policies to stimulate the economy and prevent large budget deficits.\n\n1. Higher spending: By increasing government spending, policymakers can create jobs, increase aggregate demand, and boost economic growth. This can be achieved through various channels, such as infrastructure projects, education, healthcare, and social safety net programs.\n\n2. Lower taxes: Reducing taxes can increase disposable income for households and businesses, which can increase consumption and investment. Lowering taxes on corporations and individuals can incentivize businesses to invest in new projects and hire more workers, which can stimulate economic growth.\n\n3. Sell Treasury securities: Selling Treasury securities can help reduce budget deficits by increasing government revenue. This can be done by selling off government bonds, which can raise funds that can be used for higher spending or tax cuts.\n\nOption B is incorrect because lower spending and higher taxes can reduce aggregate demand and exacerbate the recessionary gap. Option C is incorrect because lowering taxes and increasing the reserve ratio can reduce liquidity in the banking system, making it harder for businesses and households to access credit. Option D is incorrect because increasing spending and higher taxes can increase budget deficits and potentially crowd out private investment.",
