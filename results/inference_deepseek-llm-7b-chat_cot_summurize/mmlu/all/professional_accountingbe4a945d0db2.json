Minimize the likelihood of associating with clients whose management lacks integrity.\n\nQuality control policies and procedures are essential for establishing a strong foundation in the accounting profession. They serve as a means to ensure that clients are evaluated and selected based on their integrity and suitability. By minimizing the likelihood of associating with clients whose management lacks integrity, these policies and procedures protect the firm from potential legal and ethical issues.\n\nA. Providing reasonable assurance that personnel are adequately trained to fulfill their responsibilities is also an important aspect of quality control, but it is not the main purpose of establishing quality control policies and procedures for deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship.\n\nC. Documenting the matters that are required to be communicated to the audit committee is a part of the quality control process, but it is not the primary purpose of these policies and procedures for client selection.\n\nD. Enhancing the auditor's understanding of the client's business and its industry is an indirect result of having quality control policies and procedures, but it is not the main purpose for evaluating and selecting clients.",
