The President issues an executive order prohibiting the shipment and sale of the drug within the United States. Under this executive order, federal agents are empowered to prosecute all interstate shippers and sellers of the drug.

Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that \"Congress shall have the power ... To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\" The Constitution does not grant this power to the President, but rather to Congress.\n\nTherefore, the President's executive order is invalid because it is an unauthorized extension of executive power. The President does not have the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is a power specifically granted to Congress.",
