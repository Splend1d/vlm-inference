To achieve all the functions listed above\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. To enable the data bus to be used as a low order address bus.\n\nThe Intersil 8085A microprocessor has an ALE (Address Line Enable) signal that is used to control the use of the data bus as an address bus. When the ALE signal is made high, it enables the data bus to be used as a low order address bus. This allows the microprocessor to access memory locations using the lower half of the address bus, while the upper half of the address bus is used to select one of the eight 8-bit data registers.",
