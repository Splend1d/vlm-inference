What amount is the gain, if any, that the shareholder must recognize\n\nA. $0\nB. $6,000\nC. $8,000\nD. $12,000\n\nassistant:The shareholder recognizes a gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of the equipment over its basis (or cost, if greater) and subject to the liability. Therefore, the gain is: $20,000 - $6,000 = $14,000. Answer C: $8,000 is incorrect because the gain is not $8,000. Answer D: $12,000 is also incorrect because the gain is not $12,000. Answer A: $0 is incorrect because the gain is $14,000. Therefore, the correct answer is B: $6,000.",
