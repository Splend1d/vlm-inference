This DNA is subject to proofreading by several mechanisms. If a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, this would most likely be the work of which repair mechanism?\n\nA. DNA polymerase I\nB. DNA polymerase III\nC. Mismatch repair mechanism\nD. Endonuclease repair\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Mismatch repair mechanism.\n\nDuring DNA replication, mistakes can occur in the synthesis of the leading strand. These mistakes are usually corrected by proofreading enzymes such as DNA polymerase alpha and DNA polymerase beta. However, if a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, it is most likely the work of the mismatch repair mechanism. This mechanism detects mismatches between the newly synthesized strand and the template strand, and repairs them by excising the incorrect base and replacing it with the correct one.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. DNA polymerase I: This polymerase is involved in replication of both strands and is not specific to the leading strand.\n\nB. DNA polymerase III: This polymerase is involved in replication of both strands and is not specific to the leading strand.\n\nD. Endonuclease repair: This is a type of repair mechanism that cuts out damaged DNA and replaces it with healthy DNA. However, it is not specific to mismatches and is not the most likely mechanism in this scenario.",
