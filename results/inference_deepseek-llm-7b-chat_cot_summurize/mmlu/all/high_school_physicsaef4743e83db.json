Which of the following quantities must be the same for both capacitors? I. the charge stored on the capacitor II.  the voltage across the capacitor III. the capacitance of the capacitor\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. II and III only\nD. (E) I, II, and III\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\nIn this situation, the capacitors are hooked in parallel, which means they are connected in such a way that the current flows through both of them and they share the charge between them. \n\nI. The charge stored on the capacitor: Since both capacitors are identical, they will have the same charge stored on them.\n\nII. The voltage across the capacitor: When the capacitors are in parallel, the voltage across each capacitor is the same as the voltage of the external circuit. Since the external circuit is the same for both capacitors, the voltage across both capacitors will be the same.\n\nIII. The capacitance of the capacitor: The capacitance of a capacitor is a property of the specific capacitor and cannot be the same for two identical capacitors. Therefore, this statement is not true for both capacitors.\n\nTherefore, the quantities that must be the same for both capacitors are the charge stored on the capacitor and the voltage across the capacitor.",
