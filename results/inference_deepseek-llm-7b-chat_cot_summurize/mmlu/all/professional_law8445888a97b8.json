No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\nD.

At the time of the offense, the victim only saw her assailant's eyes. A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face.

Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.\n\nassistant:The court may allow the identification into evidence if it is considered reliable and accurate. In this case, the elderly woman observed the defendant's eyes during the mugging and was able to identify him later while waiting to be interviewed. While it is possible that suggestion or other factors may have influenced her identification, the fact that she saw the assailant's eyes during the offense may be considered a reliable basis for her identification. However, the court may still allow for cross-examination to challenge the reliability or credibility of the identification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.",
