Express your answer in interval notation.\n\nA. (0, 9)\nB. (1, 1)\nC. (6, 0)\nD. (6, 6)\n\nassistant:To find the values of $c$ for which the inequality $x^2-6x+c<0$ has real solutions for $x$, we first need to find the values of $c$ for which the quadratic equation $x^2-6x+c=0$ has real solutions.\n\nA quadratic equation has real solutions if the discriminant, $b^2-4ac$, is greater than or equal to 0. In this case, $a=1$, $b=-6$, and $c$ is the value we are trying to find.\n\nSo, we need to find the values of $c$ for which $(-6)^2-4(1)(c)>0$.\n\n$36-4c>0$\n\n$36-4c<0$\n\n$-4c<36$\n\n$c>9$\n\nTherefore, the values of $c$ for which the inequality $x^2-6x+c<0$ has real solutions for $x$ are in the interval $(9, \\infty)$. In interval notation, this is (0, 9).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. (0, 9).",
