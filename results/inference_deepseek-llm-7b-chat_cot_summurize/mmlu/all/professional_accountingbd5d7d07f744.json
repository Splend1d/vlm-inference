As a $180000 debit to insurance expense a $120000 credit to prepaid asset and $60000 credit to retained earnings.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the accounting treatment for insurance expenses on the accrual basis. On the accrual basis, insurance expense is recognized when the insurance policy is purchased, regardless of when the premium is paid.\n\nIn this case, Bailey purchased a four-year insurance policy in January of the prior year. Therefore, the insurance expense should be recognized in the current year's financial statements.\n\nThe correct answer is C: As a $60000 debit to insurance expense, a $120000 debit to prepaid asset, and $180000 credit to retained earnings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it records the insurance expense as a debit to prepaid insurance, which is not appropriate on the accrual basis.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it records the insurance expense as a debit to insurance expense only, which is not sufficient on the accrual basis.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it records the insurance expense as a debit to insurance expense and a credit to prepaid asset, which is not the correct accounting treatment.",
