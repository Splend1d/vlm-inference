What is the length of the longest side, in inches, immediately after the second fold? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\nA. 4.5\nB. 1\nC. 5.5\nD. 5\n\nassistant:To find the length of the longest side immediately after the second fold, we can visualize the folding process and then apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1. The paper is folded in half, resulting in two congruent triangles with base 4.5 inches and height 1 inch.\n2. The paper is folded in half again, resulting in four congruent triangles with base 2.25 inches and height 0.5 inches.\n\nNow, let's apply the Pythagorean theorem to each of the four congruent triangles:\n\nTriangle 1: (2.25)^2 + (0.5)^2 = 4.5^2\nTriangle 2: (2.25)^2 + (0.5/2)^2 = 4.5^2\nTriangle 3: (2.25)^2 + (0.25)^2 = 4.5^2\nTriangle 4: (2.25)^2 + (0.125)^2 = 4.5^2\n\nThe length of the longest side after the second fold is 4.5 inches. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 4.5 inches.",
