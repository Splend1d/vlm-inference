Seldom obsolete and usually fits the dimensions of your problem.\n\nSecondary data is often considered more reliable and accurate than primary data because it has already been collected and analyzed by someone else. Additionally, it is usually more complete and up-to-date than primary data, as it is based on information that has already been gathered. Furthermore, secondary data is often less expensive and time-consuming to gather than primary data, as it can be obtained from existing sources such as government reports, academic journals, and industry publications.",
