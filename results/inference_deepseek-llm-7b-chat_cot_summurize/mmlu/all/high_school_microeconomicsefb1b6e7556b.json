In other words, the more of a particular good or service an individual consumes, the less additional satisfaction they derive from each additional unit consumed.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because, according to the principle of diminishing marginal utility, total utility does not stay the same, and marginal utility does decrease. Option D is also incorrect because, according to the principle, both marginal utility and total utility decrease.",
