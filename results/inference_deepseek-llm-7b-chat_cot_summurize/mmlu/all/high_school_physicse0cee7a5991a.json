It is doubled.\nB. It is quadrupled.\nC. It is halved.\nD. It remains the same.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\nStep 1: Identify the given information\n- Mass of each object is doubled.\n- Distance between their centers is doubled.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for gravitational force between two objects\n- F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2\n\nStep 3: Substitute the given information into the formula\n- F = G * (2m1 * 2m2) / r^2\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression\n- F = G * (4m1 * m2) / r^2\n\nStep 5: Recognize that m1 and m2 are both doubled, so we can factor them out of the expression\n- F = G * (4m1 * m2) / r^2\n- F = 4 * G * m1 * m2 / r^2\n\nStep 6: Recall the inverse-square law of gravitation\n- F \u221d 1/r^2\n\nStep 7: Substitute the simplified expression back into the inverse-square law\n- F \u221d 4 * G * m1 * m2 / r^2\n- F \u221d 4 * m1 * m2 / r^2\n\nStep 8: Recognize that the mass of each object is doubled, so the original F is now 4 times smaller\n- F \u221d 4 * m1 * m2 / r^2\n- F \u221d 4 * m1 * m2 / (2^2)\n- F \u221d 4 * m1 * m2 / 4\n- F \u221d m1 * m2\n\nStep 9: Recall that the force of gravitational attraction between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\n- F \u221d 1/r^2\n- F \u221d 1/distance^2\n\nStep 10: Compare the original distance to the new distance\n- Original distance: 1 unit\n- New distance: 2 units\n\nStep 11: Calculate the ratio of the new distance to the original distance\n- New distance / Original distance = 2 / 1\n- New distance = 2 * Original distance\n\nStep 12: Determine the effect on the force of gravitational attraction\n- Original distance: 1 unit\n- New distance: 2 units\n- F \u221d 1/distance^2\n- F \u221d 1/(2^2)\n- F \u221d 1/4\n\nStep 13: Identify the correct answer\n- The force of gravitational attraction between two small objects is not doubled, quadrupled, halved, or remains the same. Instead, it is reduced by a factor of 1/4.\n\nAnswer: D. It remains the same.",
