In July 1990, the rancher acquired title to a 200-acre tract in a rural area. In 1997, the rancher conveyed the 200-acre tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my uncle, his heirs, and assigns, but if my uncle's wife dies without issue, to my personal assistant and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 200-acre tract, the uncle discovered considerable oil reserves on the property.

Months passed before the personal assistant learned that the uncle was selling oil from the drilling operations. The personal assistant has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal. If the decision is in favor of the uncle, it will be based on the fact that\n\nA. the right to remove oil is an incident of a defeasible fee simple.\nB. the personal assistant has no interest in the 200-acre tract.\nC. there was no showing that the uncle acted in bad faith.\nD. the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n\nThe uncle acquired title to the 200-acre tract in 1990, and the rancher's conveyance to the uncle included a provision that the uncle's wife's interest would pass to the personal assistant if she died without issue. The uncle acknowledged receipt of the consideration of one dollar and acknowledged that the property would pass to the personal assistant if the wife died without issue.\n\nTherefore, the personal assistant has an interest in the 200-acre tract and has standing to bring an action for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal. The fact that the uncle removed large quantities of oil from the property without giving notice to the personal assistant or obtaining her consent is evidence of bad faith, but it does not affect the personal assistant's right to bring an action for an accounting and an injunction.\n\nTherefore, the answer C is not correct.",
