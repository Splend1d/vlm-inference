Greene's basis at the beginning of the year is $15,000. Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000 and $2,000 of municipal bond interest for the year. Seagull distributed cash of $6,000 to Greene on November 1. What is Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year?\n\nA. $4,000\nB. $6,000\nC. $14,000\nD. $15,000\n\nassistant:To calculate Greene's basis at the end of the year, we need to consider the ordinary loss, the municipal bond interest, and the cash distribution.\n\n1. Ordinary loss: Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000 for the year. This loss reduces Greene's basis by $5,000.\n2. Municipal bond interest: Seagull reported $2,000 of municipal bond interest for the year. This interest reduces Greene's basis by $2,000.\n3. Cash distribution: Seagull distributed $6,000 to Greene on November 1. This distribution reduces Greene's basis by $6,000.\n\nLet's calculate Greene's basis at the end of the year:\n\nBasis at the beginning: $15,000\nOrdinary loss: -$5,000\nMunicipal bond interest: -$2,000\nCash distribution: -$6,000\n\nBasis at the end: $15,000 - ($5,000 + $2,000 - $6,000) = $15,000 - $13,000 = $2,000\n\nGreene's basis at the end of the year is $2,000. Therefore, the correct answer is A. $4,000.",
