However, the Fourteenth Amendment, which was adopted in 1868, incorporated the Bill of Rights against the states. This means that the Bill of Rights now applies to the states as well as the federal government. The doctrine of incorporation is the legal principle that allows the Bill of Rights to be applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.",
