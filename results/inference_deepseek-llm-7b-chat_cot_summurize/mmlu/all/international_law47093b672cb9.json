A State is 'injured' in case that it has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct\nB. A State is 'injured' in cases that there has been a violation of a peremptory norm of international law\nC. A State is 'injured' should it acknowledge the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct\nD. A State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States, including that State, and it was specially affected\n\nassistant:A State is 'injured' in the law of international responsibility when it has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct. This is option A. The injured State may seek compensation from the responsible State for the damage it has suffered. The injured State must prove that the conduct was wrongful and that it was directly and adversely affected by the conduct.\n\nTo elaborate, the internationally wrongful conduct must be of such a nature that it is incompatible with the norms of international law, and it must cause damage to the injured State. The injured State must have suffered a direct and immediate harm as a result of the internationally wrongful conduct. It must also be able to demonstrate that it was specially affected, meaning that the harm it has suffered is different or greater than the harm suffered by other States.\n\nIf the injured State can prove that it has suffered damage and that the conduct was internationally wrongful, it may seek compensation from the responsible State. The responsible State must then prove that it is not liable for the damage. This may be done by showing that the injured State failed to take reasonable care to avoid the harm or that it contributed to the harm itself.\n\nIt is important to note that the injured State must also acknowledge the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct before it can seek compensation. This is not a requirement for the conduct to be internationally wrongful, but rather a requirement for the injured State to have standing to bring a claim.\n\nIn summary, an injured State is one that has suffered damage as a result of internationally wrongful conduct. It may seek compensation from the responsible State, but the responsible State may avoid liability by proving that the injured State failed to take reasonable care to avoid the harm or that it contributed to the harm itself.",
