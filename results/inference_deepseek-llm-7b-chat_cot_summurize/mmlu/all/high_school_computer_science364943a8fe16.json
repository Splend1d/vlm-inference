An Internet Protocol (IP) address is assigned to the device.\n\nWhen a new device is connected to the Internet, it must be assigned a unique identifier to distinguish it from other devices on the network. This identifier is called an Internet Protocol (IP) address. The IP address is like a mailing address for devices on the Internet, allowing them to send and receive data.\n\nA device driver is a software program that allows a device to communicate with the computer's operating system. It is not assigned to the device when it is connected to the Internet. A packet number is used to track individual data packets in a network, but it is not assigned to the device. A Web site is a collection of web pages and related content that is hosted on the Internet. It is not assigned to a device when it is connected to the Internet.",
