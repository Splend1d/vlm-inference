Aquinas's moral theory is based on the idea that human beings are created to pursue the good and to fulfill their potential in life. According to Aquinas, this good is found in the pursuit of virtue, which is the habit of doing what is right and good.\n\nAquinas believed that morality is ultimately grounded in virtue because it is the foundation upon which all other moral principles are built. Virtues are the habits of mind and behavior that enable individuals to make good decisions and live a fulfilling life. Aquinas believed that the virtues are the ultimate source of moral authority, and that they provide the foundation for all other moral principles.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, there are seven chief virtues: wisdom, courage, temperance, justice, hope, faith, and charity. These virtues are the fundamental building blocks of human morality, and they provide the framework for all other moral principles. Aquinas believed that the pursuit of these virtues is the ultimate goal of human life, and that they are the key to living a good and fulfilling life.\n\nIn summary, according to Aquinas's moral theory, morality is ultimately grounded in virtue. Aquinas believed that the pursuit of the seven chief virtues is the foundation of all moral principles, and that it is the ultimate goal of human life.",
