There were two farms situated on the property, one farm on the eastern half and one farm on the western half of the property. The farmer recorded a general warranty deed conveying the property to his son. Two years later, the son obtained a mortgage, secured by the farm property, in favor of his friend. The friend promptly recorded the mortgage. Twenty years later, the son sold the property to an investor by a general warranty deed, with the investor assuming the friend's mortgage. The following year, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to a developer, while retaining the eastern farm. There was no mention of the mortgage in the general warranty deed between the investor and developer. The developer was unable to rezone the property to build houses as he had planned, so the developer sold the western farm to a florist. The conveyance to the florist made no mention of the friend's mortgage. Three years later, the florist entered into a contract with a rancher, pursuant to which the rancher would purchase the western farm for $75,000. The closing date for the deal was set for January 15.

The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\nD. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n\nassistant:B. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nThe friend's mortgage on the western farm is an encumbrance that makes the title to the western farm unmarketable. This is because the mortgage is a lien on the property, which means that the owner of the property (in this case, the florist) cannot sell or transfer the property without the mortgage being satisfied or released. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The rancher cannot rescind the real estate contract immediately just because the title search reveals the mortgage. The contract is between the rancher and the florist, and the florist is aware of the mortgage as it was not mentioned in the conveyance from the investor to the developer.\n\nC. The partition of the property by the investor did not create a joint tenancy between the eastern and western farms. The western farm remained subject to the friend's mortgage.\n\nD. The closing date for the deal is January 15, but the encumbrance (the mortgage) was revealed on January 10. The rancher would not be entitled to rescind the contract immediately, but only on January 15, when the closing date would have already passed.",
