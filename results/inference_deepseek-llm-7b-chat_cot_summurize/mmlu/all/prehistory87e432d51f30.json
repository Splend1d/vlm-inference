During this time, there were significant advancements in the way humans made and used tools, including the development of more advanced stone tool technologies. Additionally, the Upper Paleolithic period saw a shift in the types of resources that humans relied on for subsistence, as they began to hunt larger game animals and fish in addition to gathering plants and other resources. Finally, larger sites with increased populations can also be associated with the Upper Paleolithic period, as humans began to live in more complex and organized settlements.",
