For Mr. Hamm, the cost of pizza sauce is a component of which of the following? I. Total Fixed Costs II. Total Variable Costs III. Marginal Cost IV. Total Costs\n\nA. I and IV only\nB. II and III only\nC. II and IV only\nD. II, III, and IV only\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the cost components of Mr. Hamm's pizza sauce.\n\nI. Total Fixed Costs: These are costs that do not change with the level of production, such as rent or equipment costs. Since the cost of sauce does not depend on the number of pizzas produced, it is considered a fixed cost.\n\nII. Total Variable Costs: These are costs that change with the level of production, such as the cost of pizza dough, sauce, and toppings. The cost of sauce does depend on the number of pizzas produced, as Mr. Hamm adds more sauce with each pizza, so it can be considered a variable cost.\n\nIII. Marginal Cost: This is the additional cost incurred when producing one more unit of a good or service. In this case, the marginal cost of adding one more unit of sauce is $0.45.\n\nIV. Total Costs: These are all the costs required to produce one unit of a good or service. Since the cost of sauce is included in the total cost, it is also included in the total cost.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Hamm's cost of pizza sauce is a component of Total Fixed Costs, Total Variable Costs, Marginal Cost, and Total Costs. So the correct answer is D. II, III, and IV only.",
