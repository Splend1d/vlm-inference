This stage occurs during adolescence, around ages 12-20, and involves the struggle to establish a coherent and unique sense of self. During this stage, individuals explore their interests, values, and beliefs, and seek to establish their own identity separate from their parents. If successful, they develop a stable and confident sense of self, while if not, they may experience identity confusion and a sense of not belonging.",
