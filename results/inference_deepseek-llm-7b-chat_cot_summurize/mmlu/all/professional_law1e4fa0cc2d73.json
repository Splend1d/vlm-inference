The customer knew that the egg roll was on the floor and could have warned the wife, but chose not to do so. Therefore, the wife would not be able to recover for her injuries.\n\nA, B, and C are incorrect because they do not provide a valid reason for the wife not to recover. The fact that the egg roll was on the floor for a substantial period of time or that the chef did not know about the egg roll is not relevant to the customer's responsibility to warn the wife about the potential hazard.",
