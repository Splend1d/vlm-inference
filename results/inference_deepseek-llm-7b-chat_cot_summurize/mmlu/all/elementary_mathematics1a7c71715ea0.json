The product of 5 x 2 is even because both of the factors are even.\n5 x 2 = 10\n10 is indeed even since both 5 and 2 are both even numbers.\n\nB. The product of 4 x 4 is odd because both of the factors are even.\n4 x 4 = 16\n16 is even since 4 is even and 4 is even.\n\nC. The product of 2 x 7 is even because both of the factors are odd.\n2 x 7 = 14\n14 is even since 2 is even and 7 is odd.\n\nD. The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd.\n5 x 3 = 15\n15 is odd since 5 is odd and 3 is odd.\n\nSo, the correct statement is D. The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd.",
