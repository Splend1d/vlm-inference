Increase the speed with which messages can be transmitted. This is because the myelin sheath acts as an insulator, wrapping around the axon and increasing the speed of electrical signals (called action potentials) along the axon. This process, known as \"saltatory conduction,\" allows for much faster transmission of information compared to when the signal travels along the axon without myelin.",
