First, let's round the divisor (5.67) to the nearest whole number. \n\n5.67 \u2248 5.6\n\nNow, let's round the dividend (117.83) to the nearest whole number.\n\n117.83 \u2248 117\n\nNext, let's estimate the quotient using the rounded values.\n\n117 \ufffd 5.6 \u2248 20.96\n\nNow, let's compare the estimated quotient with the options given:\n\nA. about 10\nB. about 20\nC. about 30\nD. about 40\n\nThe estimated quotient is approximately 20.96, which is closest to option B. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. about 20",
