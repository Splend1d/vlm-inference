Determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n3. Choose the appropriate answer from the given options.\n\nStep 1: I have read and understood both scenarios.\nScenario 1: The main character sees a squirrel trapped and sets it free.\nScenario 2: The main character saves a child who was about to fall into a hole.\n\nStep 2: In the first scenario, the main character sets a squirrel free, which is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because releasing a trapped animal may put it in danger or harm it.\n\nStep 3: Since the first scenario involves a morally wrong action, the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.",
