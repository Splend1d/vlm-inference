This can lead to a change in the encoded amino acid sequence of the protein, which can have significant effects on the structure and function of the protein.\n\nIn the given options, the frameshift mutation occurs in option A. The change from \"HAS\" to \"HIT\" in the second codon results in a change from leucine to methionine, which can have significant effects on the structure and function of the protein.",
