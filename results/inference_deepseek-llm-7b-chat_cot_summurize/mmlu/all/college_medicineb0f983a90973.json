This is because ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy source for high intensity exercise, and its stores can only last for a short period of time. During high intensity exercise, muscle cells use ATP to generate energy quickly, but ATP is quickly depleted from the stores. At this point, muscle cells need to switch to other energy systems, such as glycolysis and the oxidative phosphorylation system, to continue generating energy.",
