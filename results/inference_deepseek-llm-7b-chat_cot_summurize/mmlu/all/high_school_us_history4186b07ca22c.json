It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value.

The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate. This is supported by the fact that Lincoln's reelection in 1864, which occurred after the Emancipation Proclamation, did not immediately result in the Radical Republicans' support. The other options do not directly explain why the Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861.",
