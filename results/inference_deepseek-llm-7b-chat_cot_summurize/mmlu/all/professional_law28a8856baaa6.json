Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\n\nThe defendant's right to a jury trial includes the right to have the jury decide the facts of the case. If a judge makes additional factual findings that increase the sentence beyond what the jury decided, it may be unconstitutional. The other answers are incorrect because:\n\nA. It is true that sentencing laws often allow for fact-finding, but this does not necessarily make it constitutional.\nB. The right to a jury trial does not depend on whether the defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. Courts have discretion to fashion sentences, but this does not mean they can do so unconstitutionally.",
