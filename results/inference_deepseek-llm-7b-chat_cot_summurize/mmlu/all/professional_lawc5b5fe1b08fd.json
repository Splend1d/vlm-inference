This falls under the exception to the hearsay rule known as \"party admission,\" which allows a party to introduce the statement of another party if the statement was made at or near the time of the event and was made by an agent or representative of the party offering the statement. In this case, the agent testified that he heard the broker make the same promise, which falls within the scope of his employment as a real estate agent. The broker's objection that the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal would not be successful in this case.",
