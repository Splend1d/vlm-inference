This means that the commissioners are selected from both the Republican and Democratic parties, which helps to ensure that the agency is not influenced by any one party.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about agencies planning policy cooperatively with congressional committees.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about agencies having to reapply for funding at the end of each fiscal year.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about agencies having to submit all planned policy changes to the president for approval.",
