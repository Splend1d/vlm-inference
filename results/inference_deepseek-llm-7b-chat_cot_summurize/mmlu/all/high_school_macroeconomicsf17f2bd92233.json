First, we need to understand the given information. Real GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given year, adjusted for inflation. Nominal GDP is the same, but it is not adjusted for inflation.\n\n2. We are given Real GDP = $200 billion.\n\n3. We are asked to find the value of Nominal GDP.\n\n4. To find Nominal GDP, we need to calculate the inflation rate for the year in question.\n\n5. Let's assume the inflation rate for the year is 10%.\n\n6. Now, we can calculate Nominal GDP using the formula:\n\nNominal GDP = Real GDP * (1 + Inflation Rate)\nNominal GDP = $200 billion * (1 + 0.10)\nNominal GDP = $200 billion * 1.10\nNominal GDP = $220 billion\n\n7. From the given options, the closest value to $220 billion is option C, which is $200 billion.\n\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is C. $200 billion.",
