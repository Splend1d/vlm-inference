The pH was then measured as 4.26. What is the pKa of this weak acid?\n\nA. 4.26\nB. 8.52\nC. 7.52\nD. 3.66\n\nassistant:To find the pKa of the weak acid, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npKa = -log10[A^-]\n\nwhere [A^-] is the concentration of the acid in its conjugate base form.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equilibrium constant for the acid dissociation:\n\nKa = [H^+][A^-] / [HA]\n\nwhere Ka is the acid dissociation constant, [H^+] is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+), [A^-] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\nWe are given the initial concentrations of the acid and the solvent, as well as the measured pH. We can use these values to find the hydronium ion concentration ([H^+]) and then find the equilibrium constant (Ka).\n\nThe formula for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:\n\npKa = -log10([A^-])\n\nSolving for [A^-]:\n\n[A^-] = 10^(pKa / -1)\n\n[A^-] = 10^(4.26 / -1)\n[A^-] = 10^4.26\n[A^-] \u2248 1.01 * 10^4\n\nNow, we need to find the equilibrium constant (Ka) and the hydronium ion concentration ([H^+]).\n\nKa = [H^+][A^-] / [HA]\nKa = ([H^+] * [A^-]) / [HA]\n\nSince we don't have the concentration of the acid ([HA]), we cannot directly calculate Ka. However, we can use the measured pH value to find the hydronium ion concentration ([H^+]).\n\nThe pH is given by:\n\npH = -log10([H^+])\n\nWe know that the pH is 4.26, so we can solve for [H^+]:\n\n-log10([H^+]) = 4.26\n[H^+] = 10^4.26\n[H^+] \u2248 0.0102 mol/L\n\nNow we can find the equilibrium constant (Ka):\n\nKa = (0.0102 * 1.01 * 10^4) / [HA]\n\nSince we don't have the concentration of the acid ([HA]), we cannot directly calculate Ka. However, we can use the value we found for [A^-] to express Ka in terms of pKa:\n\nKa = 10^(-pKa / -1)\nKa = 10^(-4.26 / -1)\nKa \u2248 1.41 * 10^-4\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium constant, we can find the pKa:\n\npKa = -log10(Ka)\npKa \u2248 8.52\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The pKa of the weak acid is approximately 8.52.",
