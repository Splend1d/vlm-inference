If the demand curve is price elastic and the supply curve is price inelastic\nB. If the demand curve is price elastic and the supply curve is perfectly elastic\nC. If the demand curve is price inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic\nD. If the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. If the demand curve is price elastic and the supply curve is price inelastic, then consumers would bear the largest burden of the excise tax. This is because when the demand curve is price elastic, a small increase in price will lead to a large decrease in quantity demanded. This means that consumers will be sensitive to price changes and will buy less of the product. When the supply curve is price inelastic, a small decrease in price will lead to a large increase in quantity supplied. This means that the producer is not able to adjust production easily in response to price changes. Therefore, the excise tax will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, and they will bear the largest burden of the tax.\n\nOption B is incorrect because when the demand curve is price elastic and the supply curve is perfectly elastic, there is no price difference between the consumer and producer surplus. This means that the tax burden is shared equally between the consumer and the producer.\n\nOption C is incorrect because when the demand curve is price inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic, the producer will bear the largest burden of the excise tax. This is because when the demand curve is price inelastic, a small increase in price will lead to a small decrease in quantity demanded. This means that consumers are not sensitive to price changes and will buy the same quantity of the product, regardless of price. When the supply curve is price elastic, a small decrease in price will lead to a large increase in quantity supplied. This means that the producer can adjust production easily in response to price changes. Therefore, the excise tax will be passed on to consumers through lower prices, and the producer will bear the largest burden of the tax.\n\nOption D is incorrect because when the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic, the consumer will bear the largest burden of the excise tax. This is because when the demand curve is perfectly inelastic, a small increase in price will lead to no change in quantity demanded. This means that consumers are not sensitive to price changes and will buy the same quantity of the product, regardless of price. When the supply curve is price elastic, a small decrease in price will lead to a large increase in quantity supplied. This means that the producer can adjust production easily in response to price changes. Therefore, the excise tax will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, and they will bear the largest burden of the tax.",
