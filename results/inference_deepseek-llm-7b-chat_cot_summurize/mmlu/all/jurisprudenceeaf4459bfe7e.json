It assumes the correlativity of rights and duties. Which of the following succeeds in formulating the interest theory without this correlativity?\n\nA. Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.\nB. Accepting that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.\nC. Treating an interest as the exercise of choice.\nD. Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties -only when they are actually imposed.\n\nassistant:The interest theory of rights suggests that the existence of a right is based on the existence of an interest, and that this interest should be recognized and protected by the state. This differs from the will theory of rights, which suggests that rights are based on the will of an individual or group, and that these rights must be enforced by that will.\n\nOption A suggests that X's interest is directly related to Y's duty, which aligns with the will theory of rights.\nOption B suggests that conferring a right means recognizing an interest, which aligns with the interest theory of rights.\nOption C suggests that an interest is the exercise of choice, which is not a direct statement about rights or duties.\nOption D suggests that X has a right when his interest is recognized, but only when duties are actually imposed. This aligns with the will theory of rights.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Accepting that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.",
