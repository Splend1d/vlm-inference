You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: You walked your dog 7 over 9 mi in the morning and 5 over 12 mi in the afternoon. How much farther did you walk your dog in the morning than in the afternoon?\n\nA. 13 over 36\nB. 12 over 21\nC. 2 over 3\nD. 35 over 108\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the morning and afternoon walks. First, let's find the total distance walked in the morning:\n\n7 over 9 mi + 5 over 12 mi = 7/9 + 5/12\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36:\n\n(7 * 36) / 36 + (5 * 12) / 36 = 252/36 + 60/36 = 252/36 + 60/36 = 312/36\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\n312/36 = 52/6\n\nSo, the total distance walked in the morning is 52/6 mi, which is approximately 8.67 mi.\n\nNow, let's find the total distance walked in the afternoon:\n\n7 over 9 mi + 5 over 12 mi = 7/9 + 5/12\n\nUsing the same method as before, we get:\n\n7/9 + 5/12 = 252/36 + 60/36 = 312/36\n\n312/36 = 8.89 (approximately)\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the morning and afternoon walks:\n\n8.67 mi (morning) - 8.89 mi (afternoon) = -0.22 mi\n\nSince the answer is negative, it means the user walked the dog farther in the afternoon than in the morning. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 13 over 36",
