It involves the critical examination of beliefs and assumptions, as well as the examination of the nature of reality, morality, and the human condition. While social sciences like psychology, sociology, and economics also deal with human behavior, they focus on studying these behaviors through empirical methods, such as research and data analysis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because philosophy is not primarily about disagreements between people with different beliefs or backgrounds. While debates and discussions are certainly part of philosophy, the goal is not simply to understand why people disagree, but rather to examine the underlying assumptions and values that shape their beliefs.\n\nOption C is incorrect because philosophy is not about questioning the nature of answers or questioning whether answers can ever be better or worse. Instead, philosophy is about exploring and critically examining ideas and concepts, and striving to understand them as deeply and completely as possible.\n\nOption D is incorrect because philosophy does not focus on scientific experiments or empirical methods. While philosophy can certainly engage with scientific evidence and experiments, it is not limited to this approach, and its methods include critical thinking, analysis, and discussion.",
