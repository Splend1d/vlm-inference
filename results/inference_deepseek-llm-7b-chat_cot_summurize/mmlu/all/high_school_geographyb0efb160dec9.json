World War I.\nC. World War II.\nD. the discovery of the plow.\n\nassistant:The Second Agricultural Revolution, also known as the Green Revolution, was a period of significant advances in agricultural technology and practices that took place in the mid-20th century. It is characterized by the development and widespread adoption of new agricultural techniques, such as hybrid seeds, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation systems, which significantly increased crop yields and improved food security.\n\nThe chief factor that contributed to the Second Agricultural Revolution was not the Industrial Revolution, as it was already underway during this period. World War I and World War II were also not major contributors, as they were global conflicts that had limited impact on agriculture. The discovery of the plow is also not a significant factor, as it was an ancient technology that was not new to the period of the Second Agricultural Revolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the Industrial Revolution.",
