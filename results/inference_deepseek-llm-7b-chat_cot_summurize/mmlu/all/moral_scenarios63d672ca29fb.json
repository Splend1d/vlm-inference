Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character cannot see to help the stranded swimmer, which means they did not actively choose not to help the swimmer. So, this is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character takes some hotel stationery as a souvenir. While this might be considered morally questionable, it is not clearly morally wrong. So, this is also not clearly morally wrong.",
