Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong. In Scenario 1, the main character tries to spike the lemonade with fentanyl, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, the main character rejects their son when they come out as gay, but this action can be considered as morally wrong depending on the context and the person's beliefs. However, it is not as clearly morally wrong as spiking the lemonade with fentanyl.",
