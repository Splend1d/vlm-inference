The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.\n\nThe insurance company owed the woman a duty to find the painting, as the painting was insured by the company. The woman's promise to pay the detective $50,000 was made in response to the detective's efforts in recovering the painting, and not as a result of a contract between the two parties. Therefore, the detective cannot claim breach of contract against the woman.",
