At trial, Jan wishes to offer into evidence a copy of the edition of the Times containing the allegedly libelous article. Before the newspaper may be admitted, Jan must\n\nA. call as a witness an employee of the Times to testify that the proffered newspaper was in fact published by the Times.\nB. have a certification affixed to the newspaper signed by an employee of the Times attesting to its authenticity.\nC. establish that the newspaper has been properly certified under the law of the jurisdiction where the newspaper was published.\nD. do nothing because the newspaper is self-authenticating.\n\nassistant:C. establish that the newspaper has been properly certified under the law of the jurisdiction where the newspaper was published.\n\nExplanation: In this case, the newspaper must be properly authenticated before it can be admitted into evidence. This means that Jan must establish that the newspaper has been certified under the law of the jurisdiction where it was published. This may involve obtaining a certificate from an officer of the court, a notary public, or another authorized person.\n\nA. This option is incorrect because calling a witness from the Times to testify that the newspaper was published by the Times does not necessarily establish its authenticity.\n\nB. This option is also incorrect because attaching a certification signed by an employee of the Times to the newspaper does not necessarily establish its authenticity.\n\nD. This option is incorrect because, while the newspaper may be self-authenticating in some jurisdictions, it is not necessarily self-authenticating in all jurisdictions. In Florida, for example, the newspaper must be properly authenticated before it can be admitted into evidence.",
