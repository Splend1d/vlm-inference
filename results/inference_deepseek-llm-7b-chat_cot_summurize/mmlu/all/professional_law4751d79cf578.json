Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.\nD. Because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue, the court will find that the contract does not violate the law but will allow the contractor to recover his costs only.\n\nassistant:The court is likely to rule as follows:\n\nA. Although the contract violates the law and is void, the court will require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work accepted.\n\nThis is because the contract was not properly executed due to the contractor not paying the licensing fee, which is a violation of the law. Therefore, the contract is considered void, and the court may not enforce it. However, the court may still require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work performed, as the contractor was performing work within the city limits and should have been aware of the licensing fee requirement.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the purpose of the fee is not merely to raise revenue, but also to regulate and ensure the quality of home repair work performed within the city limits.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a void contract does not necessarily mean that the court will not enforce it. The court may still require the homeowner to pay the contractor for the work performed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the purpose of the fee is not merely to raise revenue, but also to regulate and ensure the quality of home repair work performed within the city limits. Additionally, the court may require the contractor to recover only his costs, not the full value of the work performed.",
