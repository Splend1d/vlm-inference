However, this contradicts the fact that the son had conveyed a life estate to his friend, which would be considered marketable title.\n- Option B suggests the son would succeed because he had a fee simple to convey. However, the statement contradicts this, as the friend backed out due to the son not being able to convey a fee simple.\n- Option C suggests the son would not succeed because his heirs have to join in the transaction in order to convey marketable title. This contradicts the fact that the son had conveyed a life estate to his friend, which would be considered marketable title.\n- Option D suggests the son would succeed because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs. This matches the analysis from Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer\n- The son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs. Therefore, the correct answer is D. the son's succeeding, because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs.",
