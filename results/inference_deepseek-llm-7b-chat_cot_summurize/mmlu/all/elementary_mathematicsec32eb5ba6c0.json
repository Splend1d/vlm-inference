First, let's find the whole number part of the sum:\n\n27 + 15 = 42\n\nNow, let's find the decimal part of the sum:\n\n0.94 + 0.35 = 1.29\n\nTo estimate the sum to the nearest tenth, we can round the decimal part:\n\n1.29 \u2248 1.3\n\nNow, let's combine the whole number part and the estimated decimal part:\n\n42 + 1.3 \u2248 43.3\n\nSo, the answer is B. 43.3.",
