You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Two numbers added together are 19. Their product is 70. What are the two numbers?\n\nA. 5, 14\nB. 7, 10\nC. 4, 15\nD. 3, 16\n\nassistant:Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$, where $x > y$. We have the following two equations:\n\n$$x + y = 19$$\n$$xy = 70$$\n\nWe can solve the first equation for $x$ to get $x = 19 - y$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$(19 - y)y = 70$$\n$$19y - y^2 = 70$$\n\nRearranging and factoring, we get:\n\n$$y^2 - 19y + 70 = 0$$\n\nThis quadratic equation factors as $(y - 7)(y - 10) = 0$. Therefore, the possible values for $y$ are 7 and 10. Since $x > y$, we have $x = 19 - 7 = 12$ and $x = 19 - 10 = 9$. The only option that satisfies both conditions is option $\\boxed{\\text{(B) } 7, 10}$.",
