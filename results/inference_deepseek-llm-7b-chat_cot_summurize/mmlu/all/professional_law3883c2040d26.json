The friend, because he recorded his deed before the farmer.\n\nAccording to the information provided, the vintner conveyed the vineyard to the husband and wife as tenants in common, who did not record the warranty deed by which the vintner conveyed the vineyard to them. The husband subsequently sold and conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to a friend, who promptly recorded his deed. The farmer, who had no actual knowledge of any previous conveyances of the vineyard, recorded her deed.\n\nSince the friend's deed was recorded before the farmer's deed, the friend has priority over the farmer in the ownership of the vineyard. Therefore, the friend owns the vineyard.",
