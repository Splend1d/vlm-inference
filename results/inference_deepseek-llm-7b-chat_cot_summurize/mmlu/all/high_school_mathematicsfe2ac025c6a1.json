Then the given ratio becomes\n\\[\\frac{2a-b}{a+b}=2.\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $a+b$, we get\n\\[2(a+b)=2a-b.\\]\nExpanding, we have\n\\[2a+2b=2a-b.\\]\nAdding $b$ to both sides, we get\n\\[3a=3b.\\]\nDividing both sides by $3$, we have\n\\[\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{3b}{3a}=\\frac{1}{1}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1}}.\\]\nThe answer is: 1",
