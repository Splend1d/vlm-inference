This means that people intentionally chose which cats to keep and breed, based on the traits they wanted, such as smaller size, better hunting abilities, or more docile behavior. This allowed cats to become more closely associated with human societies and become domesticated animals.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the shift from opportunistic foraging to logistical collecting occurred around 12,000 years ago, not 22,000 years ago. Option C is incorrect because the domestication of cats is believed to have occurred before the advent of food production and storage, which happened around 10,000 years ago. Option D is incorrect because the domestication of cattle and production of milk and cheese occurred around 9,000 years ago, not 9,000 years after the domestication of cats.",
