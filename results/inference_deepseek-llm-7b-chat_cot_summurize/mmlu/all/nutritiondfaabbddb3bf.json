Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD\nD. Adaptation should not influence the interpretation of N-balance studies.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of nitrogen balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization. This is because the body can adapt to a certain protein intake, making it appear that less protein is needed for maintenance than would be the case in the long term. Therefore, the nitrogen balance slope may underestimate the true protein requirement.",
