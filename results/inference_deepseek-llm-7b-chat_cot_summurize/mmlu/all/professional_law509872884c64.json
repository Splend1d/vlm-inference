A witness for the defendant testified to the defendant's non-culpability at the grand jury proceeding. The witness was later called as a defense witness at the trial. During his direct examination, defendant's attorney asked him, \"Is it not true that the defendant could not have performed the abortion on the decedent since he was assisting you in another abortion at the time?\" The witness answers in the negative and states that the defendant did, in fact, perform the abortion on the girl.

The witness's testimony before the grand jury was not presented as evidence at the trial, and the judge cannot consider it as a basis for impeachment. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the defendant's attorney did not need to lay a proper foundation for impeaching his own witness. The rule requiring a proper foundation for impeaching one's own witness only applies when the witness is called by the adverse party, not when the witness is called by the party in whose favor the impeachment is sought.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a party may impeach his own witness with a prior inconsistent statement. This question is not a matter of impeaching a witness called by the adverse party, but rather a witness called by the party in whose favor the impeachment is sought.\n\nOption D is the correct answer. The defendant's attorney is allowed to impeach his own witness with a prior inconsistent statement, and the judge should not rule this question objectionable.",
