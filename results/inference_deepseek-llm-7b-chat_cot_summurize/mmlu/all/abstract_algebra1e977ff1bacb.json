False, True\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. False, True.\n\nLet's analyze the two statements:\n\nStatement 1: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nA group under matrix multiplication consists of a set of matrices, a binary operation that combines two matrices (matrix multiplication), and a set of properties that must be satisfied. These properties are:\n\n1. Closure: For any two matrices A and B in the set, the product AB is also in the set.\n2. Associativity: For any three matrices A, B, and C in the set, (AB)C = A(BC).\n3. Identity element: There is an identity matrix I in the set such that for any matrix A in the set, AI = AI = A.\n4. Inverse element: For each matrix A in the set, there exists an inverse matrix A^(-1) such that AA^(-1) = A^(-1)A = I.\n\nFor 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant, the following properties hold:\n\n1. The set is closed under matrix multiplication.\n2. Matrix multiplication is associative.\n3. The identity matrix I exists.\n4. Each matrix has an inverse (except the zero matrix).\n\nThus, the set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nStatement 2: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nFor 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1, the following properties hold:\n\n1. The set is closed under matrix multiplication.\n2. Matrix multiplication is associative.\n3. The identity matrix I exists.\n4. Each matrix has an inverse (except the zero matrix).\n\nHowever, the determinant of a matrix is a scalar value, not an element of the group. Therefore, the set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is not a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the first statement is True and the second statement is False, so the answer is D.
