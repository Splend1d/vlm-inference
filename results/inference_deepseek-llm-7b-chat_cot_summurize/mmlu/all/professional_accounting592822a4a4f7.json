Boca believes that actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages and has chosen to reimburse the state. Eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15000 of gross wages paid to each employee. Boca had four employees each of whom earned $20000 during the year.

According to the problem, each employee earned $20,000, and there were four employees. So the total eligible gross wages paid to the employees are:\n\n$20,000 \\* 4 = $80,000\n\nUnder state law, Boca Co. is required to reimburse the state for 2% of eligible gross wages. Since Boca believes that actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages, they have chosen to reimburse the state directly. Therefore, the amount that Boca should report as accrued liability for unemployment claims in its year-end balance sheet is:\n\n$80,000 \\* 2% = $1,600\n\nThe correct answer is B. $1,600.",
