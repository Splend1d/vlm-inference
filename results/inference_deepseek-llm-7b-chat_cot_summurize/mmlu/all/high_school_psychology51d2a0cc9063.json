Teachers tried time-outs and other punishments to no avail. His parents and the school decided to work with Max by giving him a sticker each time he behaved for a full hour. Once he accumulated ten stickers, he could present them to his parents who would give him a reward. The method the school and parents chose to employ is referred to as\n\nA. negative reinforcement\nB. a token economy\nC. a point value system\nD. negative punishment\n\nassistant:The method the school and parents chose to employ is referred to as a token economy. This is because they introduced a system where Max would receive a sticker for each hour of appropriate behavior, and once he accumulated ten stickers, he would receive a reward from his parents. This system is designed to encourage positive behavior and is an example of positive reinforcement.\n\nPositive reinforcement is a type of learning in which a behavior is increased by providing a consequence that increases the likelihood of the behavior recurring. In this case, Max's desired behavior (appropriate behavior) is increased because he receives a reward (a sticker and a reward from his parents) for each hour of appropriate behavior.\n\nNegative reinforcement, on the other hand, involves the removal of an undesirable stimulus to increase a behavior. For example, if a student is given a time-out as a punishment for misbehavior, this is an example of negative reinforcement because the undesirable stimulus (the time-out) is removed to increase the desired behavior (appropriate behavior).\n\nNegative punishment, as the question suggests, is the removal of a rewarding stimulus to decrease a behavior. This is different from negative reinforcement, which involves the removal of an undesirable stimulus to increase a behavior.\n\nA point value system is not the correct answer because it does not involve the use of rewards or punishments to increase or decrease a behavior.",
