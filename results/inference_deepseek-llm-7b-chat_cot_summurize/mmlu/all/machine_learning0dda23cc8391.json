L0 norm\n\nL0 regularization, also known as L0 norm regularization, Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), or T-norm, is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting and reduce the number of coefficients to zero. This is achieved by adding a penalty term to the objective function that results in a zero coefficient for certain features. The other options (B. L1 norm and C. L2 norm) are not suitable for L0 regularization. Option D, \"either (a) or (b)\", is not a valid choice as only L0 norm regularization is applied in this context.",
