If the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession, then the sister may not have any interest in the property. If the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession, then she may have an undivided one-half interest in the property. However, the sister's own laches could be a factor in determining whether she has any interest in the property. Therefore, the correct answer is A. None, because of her own laches.",
