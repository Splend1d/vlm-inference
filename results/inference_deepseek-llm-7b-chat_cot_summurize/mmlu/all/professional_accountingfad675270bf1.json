Management is unwilling to revise the financial statements and the accountant believes that modification of the standard compilation report is not adequate to communicate the deficiencies. Under these circumstances the accountant should\n\nA. Disclaim an opinion on the financial statements and advise the board of directors that the financial statements should not be relied upon.\nB.

Determine the effects of the deficiencies and add a separate paragraph to the compilation report that describes the deficiencies and their effects.\nD. Withdraw from the compilation engagement and provide no further services concerning these financial statements.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Disclaim an opinion on the financial statements and advise the board of directors that the financial statements should not be relied upon.\n\nIn this scenario, the accountant has been engaged to compile nonissuer's financial statements, but these statements contain several misapplications of accounting principles and unreasonable accounting estimates. Management is unwilling to revise the financial statements, and the accountant believes that modification of the standard compilation report is not adequate to communicate the deficiencies.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the accountant should disclaim an opinion on the financial statements and advise the board of directors that the financial statements should not be relied upon. This is because the accountant has identified significant deficiencies in the financial statements that would make it inappropriate to issue an opinion on their accuracy. Disclaiming an opinion and advising against reliance on the financial statements would help protect users of the financial statements from relying on information that may be misleading or inaccurate.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Inform management that the engagement can proceed only if distribution of the accountant's compilation report is restricted to internal use. This option does not address the issue of the deficiencies in the financial statements. It only limits the distribution of the report, but does not address the accuracy or reliability of the information in the financial statements.\n\nC. Determine the effects of the deficiencies and add a separate paragraph to the compilation report that describes the deficiencies and their effects. This option does not address the issue of the deficiencies in the financial statements. It only adds a description of the deficiencies to the compilation report, but does not disclaim an opinion or advise against reliance on the financial statements.\n\nD. Withdraw from the compilation engagement and provide no further services concerning these financial statements. This option is too extreme. While withdrawing from the engagement may be appropriate in certain situations, it may not be the most effective solution in this case. The accountant could disclaim an opinion and advise against reliance on the financial statements without withdrawing from the engagement.",
