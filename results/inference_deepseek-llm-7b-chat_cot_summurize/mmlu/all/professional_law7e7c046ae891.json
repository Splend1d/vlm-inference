A group of students painted purple a statue of the university's founder in protest to the university's federally subsidized nuclear weapon experimental studies.

The state statute in question is a reasonable attempt to regulate the behavior of students on campus, and it does not discriminate against any particular group of individuals. The statute is also clearly worded, so it cannot be argued that it is vague or overbroad.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The court is unlikely to declare the statute constitutional because it promotes a compelling state interest. The court may find that the statute is constitutional, but it is not necessary to find that the state has a compelling interest in order to uphold the statute.\n\nC. The statute is not vague or overbroad. The group leader has not provided any evidence that the statute is unclear or overly broad.\n\nD. The statute is not discriminatory on its face. The statute applies to all students who engage in disruptive campus activities, regardless of their gender or age.",
