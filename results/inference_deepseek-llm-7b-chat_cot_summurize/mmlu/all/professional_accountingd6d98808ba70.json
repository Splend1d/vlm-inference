Prior to the split Alto had 10000 shares of $10 par value common stock issued and outstanding. After the split the par value of the stock\n\nA. Remained at $10.\nB. Was reduced to $8.\nC. Was reduced to $5.\nD. Was reduced to $2.\n\nassistant:To find the answer, let's analyze the information given:\n\n1. On July 1, Alto Co. split its common stock 5 for 1.\n2. Prior to the split, Alto had 10,000 shares of $10 par value common stock issued and outstanding.\n\nWe can start by finding the number of shares outstanding after the split. Since the stock was split 5 for 1, we can multiply the number of shares before the split by the ratio of the split:\n\n10,000 shares * (5 / 1) = 50,000 shares\n\nNow let's determine the par value of the stock after the split. Since the split was a 5 for 1 split, the par value of each share would be reduced by a factor of 5:\n\n$10 par value / 5 = $2 per share\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The par value was reduced to $2.",
