The rights of students to carry concealed weapons on campus\nD. The use of racial quotas in public university admissions\n\nassistant:The Supreme Court case Regents of University of California v. Bakke concerned the use of racial quotas in public university admissions. In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled that the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) used a racial quota to admit a minority applicant, Dr. Richard Bakke, despite the fact that he had higher qualifications than other applicants. The Court found that the use of racial quotas to admit minority students was constitutional, as long as the universities used \"strict scrutiny\" to ensure that the quotas were necessary to achieve a compelling state interest in promoting diversity and providing equal educational opportunities for all students. The case is considered a landmark decision in the field of affirmative action.",
