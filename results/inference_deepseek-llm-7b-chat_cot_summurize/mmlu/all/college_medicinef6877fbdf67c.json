This is because respiration rate is directly related to the body's need for oxygen, and increased respiration rate can help dissipate heat through the process of cellular respiration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because decreasing salt retention is not a direct response to increased environmental temperature.\n\nOption C is incorrect because increasing heart rate is not a direct response to increased environmental temperature. In fact, in some cases, the body may try to maintain a lower heart rate to conserve energy and avoid overheating.\n\nOption D is incorrect because increasing water lost through skin is not a direct response to increased environmental temperature. The body may try to maintain water balance by increasing sweating, but this is not a direct response to increased temperature.",
