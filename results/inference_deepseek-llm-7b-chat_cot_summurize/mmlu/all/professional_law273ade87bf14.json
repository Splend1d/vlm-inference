They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.

The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\n\nThe plaintiff is claiming that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. The burden of persuasion in this action is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest. This means the plaintiff must show that the ordinance does not serve a compelling state interest or that it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons. The city's argument for enacting the ordinance is not relevant to this burden of persuasion.",
