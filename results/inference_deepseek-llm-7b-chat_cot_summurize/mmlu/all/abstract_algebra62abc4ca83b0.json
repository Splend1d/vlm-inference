H contains the identity element\n\nassistant:A subset H of a group (G, *) is a group if it satisfies the following four group axioms:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in H, a * b is also in H.\n2. Identity: There exists an element e in H such that for all a in H, e * a = a * e = a.\n3. Inverse: For each element a in H, there exists an element a^-1 in H such that a * a^-1 = a^-1 * a = e.\n4. Associativity: For all a, b, c in H, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. a, b in H => a * b in H",
