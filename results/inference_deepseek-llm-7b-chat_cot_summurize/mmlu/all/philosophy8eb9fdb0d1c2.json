The question asks for the condition under which an object has aesthetic value, and option B provides the correct answer.\n\nAesthetic value is often associated with objects that are pleasing to the eye or have a certain level of beauty. While it is true that some objects may serve important functions, this does not necessarily mean that they have aesthetic value. For example, a brick wall may serve a functional purpose in building a wall, but it is not necessarily considered aesthetically pleasing.\n\nOn the other hand, options A, C, and D do not accurately describe the condition under which an object has aesthetic value. Aesthetic value is not defined by the inability to be defined (option A), serving an important function (option C), or having no meaning (option D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. has no utility.",
