Since the FED sells government securities, banks must reduce their reserves to maintain the required reserve ratio.\n\nReduction in Reserves = FED's sold securities * Reserve Requirement\nReduction in Reserves = $10 million * 5%\nReduction in Reserves = $10 million * 0.05\nReduction in Reserves = $500,000\n\nNow let's see how this reduction affects the money supply. The money supply is calculated by adding the following components:\n\nM1 = Currency in circulation + Demand deposits + Checkable deposits\n\nSince we don't have information about the current money supply, let's consider the impact on each component separately:\n\n1. Currency in circulation: No change\n2. Demand deposits: No change\n3. Checkable deposits: No change\n\nNow let's calculate the potential change in the money supply:\n\nPotential Change in M1 = Reduced Reserves - $500,000\nPotential Change in M1 = $500,000\n\nBased on our calculations, the money supply can potentially increase by $50 million due to the FED's open market operation. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",
