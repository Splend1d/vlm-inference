The defendant had a gun inside his coat pocket. When the defendant entered the store, the owner saw that he had his hand in his coat pocket. Although the owner did not actually see the gun, he noticed a bulge in the defendant's coat pocket. Paranoid because of a rash of recent robberies, the owner said, \"Please don't hurt me 11 do anything you want. \" The owner then fainted and fell to the floor. The defendant walked behind the counter and opened the cash register. He took the money from the register and left the store. If the defendant is charged with robbery, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because the owner was placed in fear.\nB. guilty, because the defendant entered the store with a gun in his possession.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not make any threat of force.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant did not take any money from the victim's person.\n\nassistant:The defendant should be found guilty for both the gun in his possession and the owner being placed in fear.

Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of robbery.",
