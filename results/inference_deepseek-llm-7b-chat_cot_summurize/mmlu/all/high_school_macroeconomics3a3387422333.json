This means that the import quota will limit the number of foreign automobiles that can be imported into a country, which can cause the prices of foreign automobiles to rise. This, in turn, will protect domestic consumers, as they will have to pay more for foreign automobiles, but it will also hurt domestic producers, as they will have to compete with more expensive foreign automobiles.",
