In the first scenario, the main character added zeros to a check that their granny gave them for their birthday. While this is dishonest, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In the second scenario, the main character offers to take out the heavy trash for their pregnant wife, which is a kind and caring act, not morally wrong.",
