The salesperson's defense is based on the statute of frauds, which requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the salesperson's oral offer of fire extinguishers was for $35,000 payable 90 days after delivery, while the man's memo requested a 15% discount for cash payment seven days after installation. These two offers are inconsistent, and therefore, the salesperson is able to assert the defense of the statute of frauds under the UCC.",
