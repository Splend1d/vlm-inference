We are comparing a sound of 60 decibels to a sound of 80 decibels.\n2. The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, which means that each increase of 10 decibels represents a tenfold increase in the sound intensity.\n3. So, to find the relationship between the two sound intensities, we need to find the difference in decibels between them.\n4. 80 decibels - 60 decibels = 20 decibels.\n5. Since each increase of 10 decibels represents a tenfold increase in the sound intensity, the sound of 80 decibels is:\n6. 10^((20 decibels / 10 decibels per unit increase)) times greater than the sound of 60 decibels.\n7. 10^2 times greater.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The sound of 80 decibels has an intensity that is 10 times greater than the sound of 60 decibels.",
