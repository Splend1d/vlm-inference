Glycolysis.\nB. creatine phosphorylation.\nC. phosphocreatine stores.\nD. ATP stores.\n\nassistant:B. creatine phosphorylation.\n\nFor very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the initial energy source is from creatine phosphorylation. This process involves the conversion of creatine and phosphate molecules into creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a series of enzyme-mediated reactions. The ATP produced during this process provides the energy needed for very high force contractions, which can last for only a few seconds.",
