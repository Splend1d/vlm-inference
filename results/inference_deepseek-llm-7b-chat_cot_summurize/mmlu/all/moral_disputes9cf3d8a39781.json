Now, imagine this grocery store also has a special section where people can buy special foods that make people better at certain things. This is what a \"genetic supermarket\" is like.\n\nNow, let's talk about some social problems that might happen from having this kind of store.\n\nA. When there is less variety in people, it's like having a boring food store with only one type of food. It's not very fun, right? This is what happens when we have less diversity in people.\n\nB. Imagine people can buy food that makes them really good at sports, but only if they have a certain job or family background. This is not fair, right? This is what happens when people with certain jobs or families can buy special foods, and others can't.\n\nC. Imagine you go to a grocery store, but you can only buy food if you have a special card. This is not fair, right? This is what happens when some people have more opportunities than others.\n\nD. Imagine one person has a huge grocery store with all the best foods, and another person has only one small food to eat. This is not fair, right? This is what happens when there is more money for some people than others.\n\nNow, let's talk about the question: which of these social problems is the least serious? I think all of them are important and not nice to have in our world. But if we have to choose one, I would say the least serious one is B. The effects of engineering children to have positional goods. This is because it's not as clear-cut as the other problems, and it can be harder to notice. But it's still not a good thing to have in our world.",
