Which of the following conclusions may be related to this?\n\nA. The heat of solution of cerium(III) sulfate is exothermic.\nB. The hydration energies of cerium ions and sulfate ions are very low.\nC. The heat of solution for cerium(III) sulfate is endothermic.\nD. The solution is not an ideal solution.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The hydration energies of cerium ions and sulfate ions are very low.\n\nExplanation: The solubility of cerium(III) sulfate in hot water is less than in cold water. This suggests that the hydration energy of the cerium ions and sulfate ions is high, making it difficult for them to be hydrated in the hot water. When the temperature is lower, the hydration energy is lower, making it easier for the cerium ions and sulfate ions to be hydrated. Therefore, the hydration energies of cerium ions and sulfate ions are very low.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the heat of solution is not mentioned in the question. Option C is incorrect because the heat of solution is not mentioned in the question. Option D is incorrect because an ideal solution does not affect the solubility of cerium(III) sulfate in hot or cold water.",
