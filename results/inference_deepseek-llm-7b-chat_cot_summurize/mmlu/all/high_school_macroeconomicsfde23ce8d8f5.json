The FED lowers the discount rate.\nB. The FED sells government securities in the secondary market.\nC. The federal government spends less money.\nD. The FED lowers reserve requirements.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The FED lowers reserve requirements.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve lowers reserve requirements, banks are required to hold fewer reserves in order to meet the reserve requirements. This allows banks to lend out more money, increasing the money supply.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a lower discount rate does not necessarily decrease the money supply. It may increase borrowing by making it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve, but it does not necessarily increase the money supply.\n\nOption B is incorrect because selling government securities in the secondary market does not directly decrease the money supply. The money supply is affected by changes in reserve requirements and the monetary base, not by secondary market transactions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the federal government spending less money does not necessarily decrease the money supply. It may decrease aggregate demand and lead to a decrease in economic activity, but it does not directly decrease the money supply.",
