Eight percent of a simple random sample of 500 people are unemployed. What is the midpoint for a 95% confidence interval estimate of p?\n\nA. 0.012\nB. 0.025\nC. 0.475\nD. None of the above.\n\nassistant:To find the midpoint of the confidence interval estimate, we need to calculate the margin of error (MoE) for the sample proportion p.\n\nGiven:\nn = sample size = 500\np\u0302 = sample proportion = 0.08\n\nThe formula for the margin of error (MoE) is:\n\nMoE = Z * (p\u0302 * (1 - p\u0302)) / n\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nMoE = 1.96 * (0.08 * (1 - 0.08)) / 500\nMoE = 1.96 * (0.08 * 0.92) / 500\nMoE = 1.96 * 0.0704 / 500\nMoE = 0.01368 / 500\nMoE = 0.0002732\n\nNow, we can find the midpoint of the confidence interval by adding the sample proportion (p\u0302) and the MoE:\n\nMidpoint = p\u0302 + MoE\nMidpoint = 0.08 + 0.0002732\nMidpoint \u2248 0.0802732\n\nConverting the proportion to a percentage, we get:\n\nMidpoint (as a percentage) = 0.0802732 * 100 \u2248 8.03%\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include 8.03%. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None of the above.",
