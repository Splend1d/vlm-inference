Adjacent to his home was a vacant lot that measured 100 feet by 175 feet. The lot, which the retiree owned, was situated on the corner of Davis Street and University Way. The tract measured 100 feet along Davis Street and 175 feet along University Way. The retiree executed a deed purporting to convey the vacant lot to his lifelong friend for the consideration of $28,000. After escrow, the deed was delivered to the friend, who immediately filed it with the county recorder's office. The recorded instrument described the property conveyed as \"all the tract of land beginning at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way; thence west along Davis Street 100 feet; thence north 175 feet; thence west 100 feet; thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning. \" Three months after his conveyance to the friend, the retiree died intestate. His heirs have now filed an appropriate action contesting the friend's title to the vacant lot. Which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the outcome of this suit?\n\nA. The retiree's heirs will prevail because metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate boundary descriptions.\nB. The friend will prevail because equity will not permit forfeiture for a mere technicality.\nC. The outcome will depend on whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision.\nD. The outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 100 feet).\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The retiree's heirs will prevail because metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate boundary descriptions.\n\nIn this case, the description of the property given in the deed is in metes and bounds. Metes and bounds is a system of describing land by giving the length and direction of its boundaries in terms of landmarks or physical features on the land. In this case, the description starts at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way, and then describes the boundaries as going west 100 feet, north 175 feet, west 100 feet, and south 175 feet along University Way.\n\nThe retiree's heirs are contesting the friend's title to the vacant lot, arguing that the description in the deed is not appropriate, and that it should have been described using streets instead of landmarks or physical features. However, the metes and bounds description is still valid and appropriate, and the court is likely to find in favor of the retiree's heirs.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not accurate. Equity does not permit forfeiture for a mere technicality, so option B is not relevant. Option C is not relevant because whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision does not affect the validity of the metes and bounds description. Option D is not relevant because the last call (175 feet along University Way) does not prevail over the third call (west 100 feet) in this case.",
