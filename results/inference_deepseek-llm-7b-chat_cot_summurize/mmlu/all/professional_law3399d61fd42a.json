They planned and agreed to plant a bomb in the bank, which resulted in the death of 30 people. Therefore, they are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. However, they are not guilty of murder because they did not directly cause the deaths of the 30 people. They did not physically carry out the bombing themselves, but they planned and orchestrated it. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.",
