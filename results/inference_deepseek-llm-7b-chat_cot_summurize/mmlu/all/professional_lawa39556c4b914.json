The court may issue an injunction against the neighbor if it can be shown that their use of the road unreasonably interfered with the caterer's right of access. However, if the court finds that the neighbor's use did not unreasonably interfere with the caterer's right of access, they may refuse to grant the caterer's prayer for relief.",
