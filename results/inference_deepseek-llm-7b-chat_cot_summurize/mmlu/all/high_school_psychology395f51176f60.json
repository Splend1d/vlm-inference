This system is responsible for emotions, memory, and other cognitive processes. When alcohol is consumed, it can affect the functioning of the limbic system, leading to symptoms such as staggering and slurred speech.\n\nThe thalamus, sensorimotor cortex, and cerebellum are also important parts of the brain, but they are not as directly involved in speech as the limbic system. The thalamus is involved in processing sensory information, the sensorimotor cortex is involved in controlling movement and coordination, and the cerebellum is involved in motor control and balance. While these areas can be affected by alcohol, they are not the primary cause of the symptoms of alcohol intoxication.",
