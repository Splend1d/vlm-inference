The average price level in the country of Sherwood tripled.\n2. Robin's income increased from $30000 to $60000.\n\nNow, let's calculate the real income.\n\nReal income = Nominal income / Price level\n\nSince the average price level tripled, the new price level is 3 times the original price level. So, the new price level is 3.\n\nRobin's real income = $60000 / 3 = $20000.\n\nNow, let's compare Robin's real income with his nominal income.\n\nRobin's real income increased, but his nominal income did not.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Increased, Stayed the same.",
