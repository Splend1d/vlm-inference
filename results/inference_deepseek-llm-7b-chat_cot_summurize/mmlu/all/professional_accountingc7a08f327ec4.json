The land had a basis of $300000 and a fair market value (FMV) of $420000 and was encumbered by a $100000 mortgage. The apartment building had an FMV of $550000 and was encumbered by a $230000 mortgage. Each party assumed the other's mortgage. What is Vinton's basis in the office building?\n\nA. $300,000\nB. $320,000\nC. $430,000\nD. 550000\n\nassistant:Let's calculate Vinton's basis in the office building step by step:\n\n1. Determine the adjusted basis of the land:\n- Basis in the land: $300,000\n- FMV of the land: $420,000\n- Encumbrance on the land: $100,000\n- Adjusted basis: $300,000 - $100,000 = $200,000\n\n2. Determine the adjusted basis of the apartment building:\n- Basis in the apartment building: $550,000\n- FMV of the apartment building: $550,000\n- Encumbrance on the apartment building: $230,000\n- Adjusted basis: $550,000 - $230,000 = $320,000\n\n3. Calculate the combined basis of the land and the apartment building:\n- Combined adjusted basis: $200,000 (land) + $320,000 (apartment building) = $520,000\n\n4. Determine the FMV of the office building:\n- FMV of the office building: $550,000\n\n5. Determine the adjusted basis of the office building:\n- Adjusted basis of the office building: $550,000 - $230,000 (encumbrance on the apartment building) = $320,000\n\n6. Add the combined basis of the land and the apartment building to the adjusted basis of the office building:\n- Total basis: $520,000 (combined basis) + $320,000 (adjusted basis of the office building) = $840,000\n\nThe answer is B. $320,000",
