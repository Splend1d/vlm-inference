Crude birth rate\nB. Replacement level\nC. Mortality rate\nD. Total fertility rate\n\nassistant:The answer is D. Total fertility rate. The total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of children that women in a given population are expected to bear during their childbearing years. It is used to measure a population's level of fertility, and it is typically calculated by dividing the total number of births by the total number of women of childbearing age. A TFR of 2.1 is considered the replacement level, as it is the minimum rate needed to maintain a population at its current size.",
