The job is exhausting, and the warehouse is always short of personnel. One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire onto a truck by himself, he experienced a sharp and excruciating pain in his lower back. He did not report the incident to his employer, but continued to work. A week later, after work, he went to the doctor for treatment. The man then sues his employer, alleging that the employer failed to provide him with adequate assistance, safety equipment, and training to load heavy tractor tires, thereby contributing to his injury. The employer alleges that the man is merely trying to obtain compensation for an old back injury, unrelated to his employment. At trial, the man's doctor testified that the man told her that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck. The doctor's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as expert testimony.\nB. admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.\nC. inadmissible as a violation of the physicianpatient privilege.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nThe reason for this is that the doctor's testimony is being used to prove the man's claim that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck, which is a statement made by the man during their doctor-patient relationship. This would fall under the category of hearsay, which is a statement made outside of court that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Since this statement was not made in court and is not considered to be an exception to the hearsay rule, it would be inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
