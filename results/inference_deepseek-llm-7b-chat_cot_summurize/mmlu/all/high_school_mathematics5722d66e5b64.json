How many cases of measles would have been reported in 1987 if the number of cases reported from 1960 to 1996 decreased linearly?\n\nA. 337125\nB. 449500\nC. 27\nD. 112875\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the slope of the line that represents the decrease in the number of measles cases from 1960 to 1996, and then use that slope to find the number of cases reported in 1987.\n\nFirst, let's find the total change in the number of measles cases:\n450,000 (1960) - 500 (1996) = 445,000\n\nNow, we need to find the average change in the number of measles cases per year. To do this, we'll divide the total change by the number of years between 1960 and 1996:\n445,000 / (1996 - 1960 + 1) = 445,000 / 36 years\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the line that represents the decrease in the number of measles cases. The slope is the average change in the number of measles cases per year:\n445,000 / 36 = 12,312.5 cases per year\n\nNow, we'll use the slope to find the number of measles cases reported in 1987:\n12,312.5 cases per year * (1987 - 1960 + 1) = 1987 - 1960 + 1 = 28 years\n\nFinally, we'll find the total number of measles cases reported in 1987 by multiplying the slope by the number of years:\n12,312.5 cases per year * 28 years = 348,900 cases\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.
