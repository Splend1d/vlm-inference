(s)he immediately becomes sexually aroused again and feels good about the behaviour\n\nassistant:A sexual addict may experience feelings of hopelessness and despair after completing a sexual act (option A). This is because the addictive behavior has not been resolved, and the individual may continue to engage in the behavior in order to avoid negative emotions. Option B is not an accurate representation of the experience, as the individual may not use their fantasy to become aroused again. Option C is not a common experience, as sexual addiction often leads to emotional distress and discomfort. Option D is not a typical experience, as sexual addiction is not typically associated with immediate arousal.",
