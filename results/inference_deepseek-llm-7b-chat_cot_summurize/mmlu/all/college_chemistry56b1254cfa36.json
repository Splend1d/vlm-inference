In which region of the spectrum is this wavelength found?\n\nA. X-ray\nB. Ultraviolet\nC. Visible\nD. Infrared\n\nassistant:The given wavelength of 190 nm corresponds to a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* excitation in the protein molecule. This excitation is typically associated with the absorption of ultraviolet light. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. Ultraviolet",
