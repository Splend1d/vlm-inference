The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\nD. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nWhen a major earthquake destroys much of the plant and equipment on the West Coast, it will have a negative impact on aggregate supply. This means that the supply of goods and services in the economy will decrease. As a result, the equilibrium price level will increase to match the new equilibrium quantity of output, which will decrease.",
