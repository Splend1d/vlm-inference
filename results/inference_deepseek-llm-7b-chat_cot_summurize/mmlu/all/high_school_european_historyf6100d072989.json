Ar\u00eate\n\nassistant:The intellectual hallmark of the Renaissance that seems most in conflict with the questioning of ancient philosophers through experimentation in natural philosophy is A. Humanism.\n\nHumanism was a key intellectual movement of the Renaissance, emphasizing the value and dignity of human beings and their potential for knowledge and understanding. This emphasis on human potential and the importance of individual thought and inquiry was in direct conflict with the traditional approach of the ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle, who believed in the authority of their teachings and were less inclined to question or experiment in their pursuit of knowledge.",
