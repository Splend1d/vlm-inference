The businessman's company manufactures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances.

This constitutes a valid claim for damages against the businessman and the company. The fact that the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves does not absolve the businessman and the company from responsibility for causing the interference in the first place.",
