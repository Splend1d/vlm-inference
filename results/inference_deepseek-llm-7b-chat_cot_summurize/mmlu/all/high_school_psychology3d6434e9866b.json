Not realizing how cold the pool is after you are under the water for a few minutes is an example of sensory adaptation. This occurs when the body adjusts to a constant stimulus, such as water temperature, and stops perceiving it as cold after a while. The other options do not necessarily involve adaptation to a constant stimulus, and therefore do not best exemplify sensory adaptation.",
