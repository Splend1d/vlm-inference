However, the passenger's testimony of the woman's dying declaration is hearsay, which means it is a statement made by a person other than the declarant during the course of an ongoing judicial proceeding, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the passenger is not an eyewitness to the accident, but rather a witness to the woman's statement made after the accident. Therefore, the court should rule the passenger's testimony inadmissible.",
