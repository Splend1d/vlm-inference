The market price on September 15.\nC. The market price on September 20.\nD. The market price on September 30.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The market price on September 15.\n\nThe contract was made on September 1, and the market price on September 15 was much higher than it was on September 1. This is because of the worldwide shortage of widgets that happened on September 15. So, the market price on September 15 would be considered the market price of widgets for the purpose of determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled.\n\nThe other options are wrong because:\nA. The market price on September 1 is not relevant because it was before the shortage occurred.\nC. The market price on September 20 is not relevant because the buyer did not know about the shortage yet.\nD. The market price on September 30 is not relevant because the contract required delivery no later than September 30, and the seller decided not to deliver the widgets.",
