Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they can be either non-essential or essential, depending on whether they can be synthesized by the body or not. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamine are all non-essential amino acids, which means that the body can produce them on its own. Palmitic acid, on the other hand, is a fatty acid and not an amino acid.",
