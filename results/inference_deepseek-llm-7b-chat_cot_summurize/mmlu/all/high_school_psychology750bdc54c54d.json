According to the text, Max channeled all his energies into his artwork after Suzy decided to go to the prom with Dylan, which implies that he is suppressing his feelings and emotions related to the situation. Repression is the process of pushing unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or ideas out of conscious awareness in order to avoid experiencing them. In this case, Max is pushing his feelings of jealousy and anger towards Suzy and Dylan out of his conscious awareness by channeling his energies into his artwork.",
