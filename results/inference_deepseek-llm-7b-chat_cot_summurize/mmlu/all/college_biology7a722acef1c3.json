In the DNA double helix, each strand has a complementary sequence. When the two strands are separated, they align with their complementary sequence.\n\nThe given DNA sequence is 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032. To find the complementary sequence, we can reverse the order of the bases and match the complementary sequence.\n\nThe reverse sequence of the given DNA strand is 3\u2032 TTG CGA 5\u2032. Now, we need to find the complementary sequence of this reverse strand.\n\nThe rules for complementary base pairing are as follows:\n- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T)\n- Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G)\n\nUsing these rules, we can determine the complementary sequence of the reverse strand:\n- 3\u2032 TTG CGA 5\u2032 -> 3\u2032 TGA GCA TTG 5\u2032\n\nComparing the complementary sequence with the given options, we find that the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032",
