Standard-setting means putting forward non-binding legal standards\nD. Standard-setting means setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties\n\nassistant:The function of \"standard-setting in human rights diplomacy is to set certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties (D). This involves establishing clear and explicit guidelines for states to follow in the promotion and protection of human rights. The process of standard-setting can lead to the adoption of binding or non-binding legal standards, depending on the specific context and consensus reached by the participating states.\n\nBinding legal standards are legally enforceable and can lead to consequences if not followed, such as sanctions or penalties. Non-binding legal standards, on the other hand, are not legally enforceable but provide a framework of expectations for states to follow when addressing human rights issues.\n\nIn summary, standard-setting in human rights diplomacy plays a crucial role in promoting and protecting human rights by establishing clear guidelines and expectations for states to follow. These guidelines can be binding or non-binding, depending on the specific context and consensus reached by the participating states.",
