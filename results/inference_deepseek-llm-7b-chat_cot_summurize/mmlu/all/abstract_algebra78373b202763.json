The function g must necessarily be injective.\n\nSince g(f(a)) = a implies that g is the inverse of f, and the inverse of a function is always injective, then the function g must necessarily be injective.\n\n2. The function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\nTo show that g is surjective, we need to find a way to map every element in B to an element in A. Since f(a) = b, where b is an element of B, and g(a) = b, then we can conclude that g is surjective.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\nStatement 1 | The function g must necessarily be injective.\nStatement 2 | The function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\nThe answer is A.
