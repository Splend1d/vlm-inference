All of the above.\n\nTo determine the subsistence practices of people, it is important to consider various sources of information. The faunal assemblage from a site can provide information about the types of animals that were hunted or gathered by the people who lived there. An osteological comparative collection from a site can provide information about the types of tools and weapons that were used for hunting and gathering, as well as the age and sex of the individuals who used them. Pumice and evidence of pyroclastic surges can provide information about the geological and environmental conditions in the area, which can also affect the subsistence practices of the people who lived there.",
