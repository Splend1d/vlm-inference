Statement 2 | The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2.\n\nThis statement is true. In a group, the operation can be performed on any element. If a and b are two distinct elements in the group, their squares (a^2 and b^2) will also be distinct elements of the group. This is because the operation can only be performed a certain number of times before it returns to the original element (in this case, the square). Since a and b are distinct, their squares will also be distinct.\n\nStatement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nThis statement is also true. In a dihedral group, the set of rotations forms a subgroup, and it is a cyclic subgroup. This is because the rotations can be generated by a single element (for example, a rotation by 90 degrees can be generated by the element 1/2). Since this subgroup can be generated by a single element, it is a cyclic subgroup.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A. True, True.",
