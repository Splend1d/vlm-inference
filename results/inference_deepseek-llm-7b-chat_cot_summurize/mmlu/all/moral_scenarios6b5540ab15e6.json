Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character simply runs over fresh grass with a lawnmower, which does not seem to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is selling their guitar without telling their friend. While this might be considered morally questionable, it does not necessarily meet the threshold of \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
