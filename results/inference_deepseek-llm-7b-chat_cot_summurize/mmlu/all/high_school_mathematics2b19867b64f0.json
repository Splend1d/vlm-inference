(1, 5)\n\nassistant:To determine which point is NOT a solution to both inequalities, we can first solve the two equations separately and then find the points where both equations intersect.\n\nFor the first inequality y > 9x - 8, we can rewrite it as y = 9x - 8.\n\nFor the second inequality y < -x + 8, we can rewrite it as y = -x + 8.\n\nNow, we need to find the points where both equations intersect. We can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n9x - 8 = -x + 8\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n10x = 0\nx = 0\n\nNow that we have the x-value, we can find the corresponding y-value for each equation:\n\nFor y > 9x - 8:\ny = 9(0) - 8\ny = -8\n\nFor y < -x + 8:\ny = -(-1) + 8\ny = 7\n\nSince x = 0, the point (0, 7) is a solution to both inequalities. Therefore, none of the given options are the solution to both inequalities. However, we can still determine which point is not a solution to both inequalities.\n\nA.
