A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite\u2019s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite\u2019s new orbit?\n\nA. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.\nB. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.\nC. The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.\nD. The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. The satellite orbits Earth in a circle with constant speed. This means that the satellite's speed is always the same, and it moves in a circular path around the Earth.\n\n2. A meteor collides with the satellite at point P, increasing its speed by 1%. However, the direction of the satellite's velocity does not change.\n\n3. After the collision, the satellite's new orbit is described.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that the speed of the satellite increases by 1% after the collision. Since the satellite was already moving in a circle, this means that its radius will increase by a small amount (the increase in speed is 1% of the original speed).\n\nTherefore, the satellite's new orbit will be a circle with a slightly larger radius.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.",
