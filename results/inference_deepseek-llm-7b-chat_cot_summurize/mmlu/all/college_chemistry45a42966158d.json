This is because the rate law for a zero-order reaction is given by d[A]/dt = -r[A], where [A] is the concentration of A and r is the rate constant. Solving for r gives r = -d[A]/dt / [A]. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, ln(r) = ln(-d[A]/dt / [A]) = -ln[A]. Thus, r = k ln[A], where k is the rate constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) r = k ln[A].",
