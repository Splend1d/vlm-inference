Close to zero\nB. Close to plus one\nC. Close to minus one\nD. Close to either minus one or plus one\n\nassistant:The answer is D. Close to either minus one or plus one.\n\nA Durbin-Watson statistic is a measure of the relationship between a time series and its own first-order autocorrelation. A value close to zero indicates that the time series is random, while a value close to one or minus one indicates that the time series is either over-or under-replicated. Therefore, when a Durbin Watson statistic takes a value close to zero, the first order autocorrelation coefficient will be close to either minus one or plus one.",
