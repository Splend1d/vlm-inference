A decrease in the unemployment rate.\n\nAn increase in the size of the labor force and a decrease in the unemployment rate can lead to economic growth. When more people are working and the unemployment rate is low, it means that there are more consumers spending money, which in turn leads to businesses producing more goods and services, and ultimately leads to economic growth.\n\nOption D, a decrease in the population, would not necessarily result in economic growth. While a smaller population may lead to lower costs for things like education and healthcare, it could also decrease the demand for goods and services, leading to slower economic growth or even a decrease in economic output.",
