So, the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency. \n\nThe correct order of the categories of electromagnetic radiation from shortest to longest wavelength is:\n\n- Radio waves: The longest wavelength, with a frequency of 3 Hz or less.\n- Infrared: The next longest wavelength, with a frequency of 3 Hz to 300 GHz.\n- Visible light: The next shorter wavelength, with a frequency of 300 GHz to 750 THz.\n- Ultraviolet: The shortest wavelength, with a frequency of 750 THz to 3 EHz.\n- X-rays: The next shorter wavelength, with a frequency of 3 EHz to 30 EHz.\n- Gamma rays: The shortest wavelength, with a frequency of 30 EHz or higher.\n\nSo, option B is correct because it correctly orders the different categories of electromagnetic radiation from shortest to longest wavelength.",
