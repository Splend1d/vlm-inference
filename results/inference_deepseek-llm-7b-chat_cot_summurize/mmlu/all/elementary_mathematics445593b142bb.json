The remaining soccer balls are one of three different colors (blue, pink, or green). There is an equal numberof blue, pink, and green balls How many green soccer balls does Coach Wu have?\n\nA. 7\nB. 10\nC. 21\nD. 39\n\nassistant:Let's reason about the problem step by step:\n\n1. There are a total of 30 soccer balls.\n2. Out of these, 9 soccer balls are white.\n3. The remaining soccer balls are blue, pink, or green.\n4. There is an equal number of blue, pink, and green soccer balls.\n\nLet's assume that there are x blue, pink, and green soccer balls each.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of green soccer balls:\n\nTotal soccer balls = White soccer balls + Blue soccer balls + Pink soccer balls + Green soccer balls\n30 = 9 + x + x + x\n30 = 18 + 3x\n3x = 12\nx = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 blue soccer balls, 4 pink soccer balls, and 4 green soccer balls.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of green soccer balls:\n\nNumber of green soccer balls = 4\n\nSo, Coach Wu has 4 green soccer balls.\n\nThe answer is C. 21",
