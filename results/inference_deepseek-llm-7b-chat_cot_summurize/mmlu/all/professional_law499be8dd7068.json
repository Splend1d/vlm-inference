No, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease.\n\nassistant:B. Yes, because consideration for the option can be inferred from the previous month-to-month lease.\n\nThe landlord's letter did not explicitly state that the tenant had to pay the one-dollar consideration in order for the offer to be valid. Therefore, the consideration for the option can be inferred from the tenant's existing month-to-month lease, which was still in effect at the time the letter was mailed.\n\nThe landlord's change of heart and demand for immediate eviction does not negate the validity of the initial offer. The tenant had the option to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, provided they paid two months' rent in advance. The tenant did not pay the one-dollar consideration, but this does not necessarily mean that the offer was invalid.\n\nTherefore, the landlord's letter did constitute an effective offer for a two-year lease, even without the tenant's payment of the one-dollar consideration. The tenant could have exercised their option to sign the lease by paying the two months' rent in advance and signing the two-year lease.",
