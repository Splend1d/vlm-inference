Reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines\n\nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport layer protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite. It is responsible for ensuring reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines. TCP provides a reliable and ordered delivery of data between the sender and receiver, and it uses a sliding window mechanism for flow control.\n\nA. Routing packets through the network: This is the responsibility of the IP (Internet Protocol) protocol, which is the network layer protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite.\n\nC. Reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected: This is the responsibility of the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) or other messaging protocols, which are used to send large messages over a network.\n\nD. Dealing with differences among operating system architectures: This is not a specific function of the TCP protocol. Different operating systems can use TCP or other transport layer protocols to communicate with each other, but the underlying differences among operating systems are handled by the application layer protocols and the operating system's own mechanisms.",
