This is a normal developmental stage in which infants begin to recognize the difference between themselves and others, and experience distress when separated from their primary caregiver. This distress typically peaks around six months of age and decreases over time as the child becomes more secure in their attachment. Reactive attachment disorder, on the other hand, is a more serious condition that occurs when a child fails to develop a secure attachment to at least one caregiver, typically due to neglect, abuse, or other adverse experiences. Object permanence refers to a child's understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, and is typically developed between four and six months of age.",
