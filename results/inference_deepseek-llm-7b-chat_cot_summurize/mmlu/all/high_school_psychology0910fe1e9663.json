This is the correct answer.\n\nKohlberg's theory of moral development is a framework that describes how individuals reason about moral and ethical issues. It is divided into six stages, with each stage representing a different level of reasoning. The postconventional level is the highest level of moral reasoning, and it involves the ability to take another person's perspective and understand the moral reasoning of others.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Being generous does not necessarily correlate with moral reasoning.\nB. Believing in God is not a requirement for reasoning at the postconventional level.\nC. Having a successful resolution of the integrity versus despair stage is not the only factor that determines moral reasoning at the postconventional level.",
