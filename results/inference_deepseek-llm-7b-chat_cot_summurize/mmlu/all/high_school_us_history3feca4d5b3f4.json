Roosevelt's \"Day of Infamy\"\n\nassistant:The statement above is most in harmony with the sentiments in Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. \n\nThe Gettysburg Address, delivered by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, is a famous speech that emphasizes the importance of unity, equality, and impartiality in the face of conflict. Lincoln's speech is known for its concise language and powerful message, emphasizing the need for a unified and impartial nation during a time of war.\n\nIn contrast, the other options do not align with the sentiments in the provided statement:\n\nA. Washington's Farewell Address, delivered by President George Washington in 1796, focuses on the principles of republicanism and the importance of avoiding foreign entanglements. It does not discuss the specifics of neutral obligations or the duties of a neutral government during wartime.\n\nB. George H. W. Bush's \"A Thousand Points of Light,\" delivered in 1990, focuses on the idea of individual volunteerism and community service. It does not address the themes of neutrality or the duties of a neutral government.\n\nC. Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Day of Infamy,\" delivered in 1941, was given in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It focuses on the United States' declaration of war against Japan and does not discuss neutral obligations or the duties of a neutral government.\n\nD. None of the options provided is an exact match for the sentiments in Woodrow Wilson's 1914 neutrality proclamation, as this speech was given during World War I and focused on the specific duties and obligations of the United States as a neutral power.",
