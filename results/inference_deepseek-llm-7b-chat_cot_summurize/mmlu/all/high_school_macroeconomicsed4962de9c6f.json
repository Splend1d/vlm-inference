Eliminate a recessionary gap: Expansionary fiscal policy can help stimulate the economy by increasing government spending and/or reducing taxes, which can help reduce unemployment and increase economic growth. Therefore, this option is plausible.\n\nB. Reduce inflation: Expansionary fiscal policy can actually increase inflation if it leads to an increase in aggregate demand and a rise in prices. Therefore, this option is not likely to be the primary purpose of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nC. Reduce the interest rate: Expansionary fiscal policy can indirectly affect interest rates by increasing the money supply and decreasing the supply of goods and services. However, it is not the primary purpose of this policy.\n\nD. Eliminate an inflationary gap: As mentioned earlier, expansionary fiscal policy can increase inflation. Therefore, this option is not likely to be the primary purpose of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible answer is A. Eliminate a recessionary gap, as it aligns with the primary purpose of expansionary fiscal policy, which is to stimulate the economy by increasing government spending and/or reducing taxes.",
