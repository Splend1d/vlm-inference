The center of the circle is given by the coordinates of the vertex of the circle.\n\nFirst, we need to complete the square for the given equation:\n\n$(x^2-24x +100) + (y^2+10y +25) = 160$\n\n$(x^2-24x +125) + (y^2+10y +25) = 160$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$(x-12)^2 + (y+5)^2 = 100$\n\nThis equation represents a circle with center at $(12, -5)$ and radius 10. The shortest distance from the origin to the center of the circle is the distance between the origin $(0,0)$ and the center $(12, -5)$.\n\nUsing the distance formula, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144+64} = \\sqrt{208} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{13}}$\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 4\u221a13.",
