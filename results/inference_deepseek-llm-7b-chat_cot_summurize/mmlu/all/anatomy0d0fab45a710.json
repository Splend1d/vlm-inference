Abducens\nB. Hypoglossal\nC. Olfactory\nD. Trochlear\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Olfactory.\n\nThe olfactory nerve, also known as the third cranial nerve (CN III), is responsible for transmitting sensory information related to the sense of smell to the brain. It carries smell-related information from the nose to the brain, where it is processed and interpreted. The other options listed (A, B, and D) are not related to the sense of smell. The abducens nerve (A) is responsible for controlling eye movement, the hypoglossal nerve (B) controls the movement of the tongue, and the trochlear nerve (D) controls eye movement as well.",
