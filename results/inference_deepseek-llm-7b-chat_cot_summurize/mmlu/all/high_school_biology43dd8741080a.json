This is an example of\n\nA. imprinting.\nB. fixed-action pattern.\nC. agonistic behavior.\nD. habituation.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. habituation.\n\nIn this scenario, the baby duck learns to associate the large object being tossed overhead with no danger, and stops running for cover when it appears again. This is an example of habituation, which is a form of learning where an animal becomes less responsive to a repeated or predictable stimulus over time.\n\nA. imprinting is a specific type of learning in which young animals, especially birds, learn to associate people or other animals as their parents, which is not applicable to this scenario.\n\nB. fixed-action pattern is a type of behavior in animals that occurs in a predictable sequence, such as the courting behavior of birds, which is also not applicable to this scenario.\n\nC. agonistic behavior is aggressive or confrontational behavior between animals, which is not what is happening in this scenario.",
