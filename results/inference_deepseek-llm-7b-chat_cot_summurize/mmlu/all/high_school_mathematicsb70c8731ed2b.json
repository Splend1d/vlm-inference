What is $\\frac{q}{p}$?\n\nA. 3\nB. -34\nC. -38\nD. 11\n\nassistant:To rewrite the expression $6j^2 - 4j + 12$ in the form $c(j + p)^2 + q$, we first complete the square.\n\nWe can rewrite $6j^2 - 4j + 12$ as $(3j)^2 - 4(3j) + 12$.\n\nTo complete the square, we need to add and subtract a constant that is equal to $\\frac{b}{2}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the $j$ term. In this case, $\\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2$.\n\n$(3j)^2 - 4(3j) + 12$ can be rewritten as $(3j - 2)^2 - 12$.\n\nNow, we can factor out a $1$ from the expression: $1(3j - 2)^2 - 12$.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as $1(3j - 2)^2 - 12 = 1[(3j)^2 - 2(3j)(-2)] - 12$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $1[(3j)^2 + 2(3j)(-2)] - 12$.\n\nFurther simplifying, we get $1[(3j)^2 + 6(3j)] - 12$.\n\nExpanding, we get $1(9j^2 + 18j) - 12$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as $9j^2 + 18j - 12$.\n\nWe can factor out a $3$ from the expression: $3(3j^2 + 6j) - 12$.\n\nTo form the desired expression $c(j + p)^2 + q$, we need to add and subtract a constant that is equal to $\\frac{3c}{3p} = \\frac{c}{p}$. In this case, $\\frac{c}{p} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3$.\n\nTherefore, $3(3j^2 + 6j) - 12 = 3(3j^2 + 6j + 4) = 3(9j^2 + 18j + 4)$.\n\nNow, we can factor out a $3$ from the expression: $3(3j + 2)^2 + 3(4)$.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as $3(3j + 2)^2 + 3(4) = 3(9(j + 2)^2 + 16)$.\n\nFinally, we get the desired expression $3(9j^2 + 24j + 48) + 3(4) = 3(9(j + 2)^2 + 16) + 12$.\n\nComparing this expression to the given expression $c(j + p)^2 + q$, we can see that $c = 3$, $p = 3$, and $q = 12$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4$.\n\nThe answer is: 4",
