These benefits extend beyond Chris himself and have an impact on society as a whole. These external benefits can be considered as externalities, which are the positive or negative impacts that a particular action or decision has on people or things that are not directly involved in the decision-making process.\n\nIn this case, the external benefits of education are positive, as they contribute to the improvement of society. Therefore, the government should provide subsidies to encourage people to pursue education and to ensure that everyone has access to quality education. This is because the benefits of education extend beyond the individual and have an impact on society as a whole.",
