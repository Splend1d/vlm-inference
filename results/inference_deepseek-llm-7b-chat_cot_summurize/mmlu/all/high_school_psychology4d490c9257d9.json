During this stage, which occurs between the ages of 18 months and 3 years, children are learning to control their bodily functions, such as bowel movements and bladder control. If children are successful in this process, they develop a sense of control and confidence, which is reflected in Erikson's initiative. If they are not successful, they may develop feelings of shame and guilt, which is reflected in Erikson's guilt stage.",
