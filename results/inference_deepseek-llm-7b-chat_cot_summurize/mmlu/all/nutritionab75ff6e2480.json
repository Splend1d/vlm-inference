Adaptive responses include:\n\n\nA. lowering intramuscular lipid storage\nB. Increasing liver glycogen content\nC. Increasing muscle glycogen use during exercise\nD. Increasing intramuscular lipid use during exercise\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Increasing liver glycogen content.\n\nEndurance type exercise training modulates fuel storage and substrate use, and adaptive responses to this include increasing liver glycogen content. During endurance exercise, the body uses fat as a primary energy source, and the liver plays a crucial role in storing glycogen and releasing glucose to provide energy during exercise. Therefore, increasing liver glycogen content is an adaptive response to endurance type exercise training.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lowering intramuscular lipid storage is not an adaptive response to endurance exercise training. Instead, muscle glycogen use is increased during exercise, which is why option C is also incorrect. Option D is incorrect because increasing intramuscular lipid use during exercise is not an adaptive response to endurance exercise training. Instead, the body prefers to use fat as an energy source, and increasing intramuscular lipid use would not be beneficial for endurance exercise.",
