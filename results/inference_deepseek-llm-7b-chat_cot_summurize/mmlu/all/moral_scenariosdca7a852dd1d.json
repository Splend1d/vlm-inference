Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character cheats on a test by writing the answers on their hand. Cheating on a test is generally considered morally wrong, as it goes against the principles of honesty and fairness.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character helps their friend who is under house arrest to get out of the house. While this may not be the most ethical decision, it is not necessarily morally wrong. The friend may have a valid reason for wanting to leave their house, and the main character is helping them to do so within the boundaries of the house arrest.",
