Hysterotomy: Hysterotomy is a surgical method of abortion in which the uterus is opened and the fetus is removed. It is considered the most costly and carries the greatest risk of complications due to the invasiveness of the procedure.\n\n2. Saline-induced abortion: Saline-induced abortion involves using a saline solution to induce contractions and expel the fetus. This method is generally considered to be less costly and risky than hysterotomy, but it still carries some risks of complications.\n\n3. Prostaglandin abortion: Prostaglandin abortion involves using medication to induce contractions and expel the fetus. This method is generally considered to be less costly and risky than both hysterotomy and saline-induced abortion, as it involves fewer risks and has a lower cost.\n\n4. Dilation and curettage: Dilation and curettage (D&C) is a surgical procedure in which the cervix is dilated and the uterus is scraped to remove the contents. This method is generally considered to be less costly and risky than hysterotomy, but it still carries some risks of complications.\n\nBased on this information, the method that is most costly and carries the greatest risk of complications is hysterotomy.",
