If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\nA topological space is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. Since A and C are nonempty subsets of X, we have A c B c C, which implies that either A c B or B c C. Therefore, either A and C are connected, or at least one of them is connected and the other is not. It is not necessarily true that B is connected if A and C are connected.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\nA topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. If A and C are compact, then every open cover of A and C has a finite subcover. Since B is a proper subset of A and C, it follows that B is also a subset of the finite subcover of the open cover of A and C. Therefore, B has a finite subcover, and B is compact.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\nA topological space is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points x and y in the space, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x, y \u2208 U and y \u2209 U, and x \u2209 V and y \u2208 V. Since A and C are nonempty subsets of X and A c B c C, we have that A and C are disjoint. Therefore, B is also a subset of the finite subcover of the open cover of A and C. Since A and C are Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that x \u2208 U, y \u2208 V, and x \u2209 U, y \u2208 V. Thus, B is also a subset of the finite subcover of the open cover of A and C, and B is Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, statements I, II, and III are all true. The correct answer is D.",
