The reason is that the graduate's mother had a pre-existing duty to pay the graduate, which is not dependent on any agreement between the graduate and the uncle. According to the law, an agreement that is based on a pre-existing duty is not binding and cannot be enforced.\n\nIn this case, the graduate's mother had a duty to support and provide for her daughter, which is a fundamental obligation of a parent to a child. Therefore, the uncle's promise to pay the graduate if anything happens to her mother is unenforceable, as it is based on a pre-existing duty that the mother had to the graduate.",
