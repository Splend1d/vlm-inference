This would have allowed the young man to stop and not cause any harm. The young man did not have the opportunity to understand the situation and could not have reasonably anticipated the guard's actions.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The guard did not use unreasonable force to protect the homeowner's property. The guard only fired one shot in self-defense.\n\nC. The young man was engaged in theft when he was shot, but this does not give the security guard the right to use excessive force to protect the homeowner's property.\n\nD. The young man was not engaged in theft when he was shot, but the guard should have given a warning before using his gun.",
