The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score\nD. The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA.\n\nThe multiple correlation, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. In this case, the dependent variable is the first-year high school GPA, and the independent variables are the achievement and aptitude test scores and the school interest inventory score.\n\nThe multiple correlation will increase if the school interest inventory score is included as a predictor variable, because it will increase the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores is not the major concern, because it is not directly related to the prediction of the GPA. The zero-order correlation between the GPA and the inventory score is also not the major concern, because it is a measure of the relationship between the two variables without considering the independent variables. The difference in the correlations of the inventory score with the GPA and the test scores with the GPA is not the major concern, because it is not a measure of the predictive power of the independent variables.",
