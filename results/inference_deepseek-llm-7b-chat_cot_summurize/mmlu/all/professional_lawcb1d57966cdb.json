He was intoxicated and thought the gun was unloaded, which is a clear indication that he did not have the requisite knowledge and care to participate in such a dangerous activity.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the first friend did not intend to place the second friend in apprehension. Answer B is incorrect because the second friend was not aware that there was a substantial certainty that he would be placed in apprehension. Answer D is incorrect because the second friend did not consent to participate in the Russian roulette game.",
