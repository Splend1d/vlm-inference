Which interval, to the nearest minute, contains the middle 80% of durations?\n\nA. 15 minutes to 319 minutes\nB. 53 minutes to 281 minutes\nC. 70 minutes to 264 minutes\nD. 91 minutes to 243 minutes\n\nassistant:To find the interval that contains the middle 80% of durations, we need to find the 80th percentile of the distribution. We can do this by finding the cumulative distribution function (CDF) value corresponding to the 80th percentile and then subtracting it from the mean.\n\nUsing a normal distribution calculator or table, we find that the 80th percentile is approximately equal to the mean minus 1.345 standard deviations. In this case, the standard deviation is 76 minutes, so:\n\n80th percentile = mean - 1.345 * standard deviation\n80th percentile = 167 minutes - 1.345 * 76 minutes\n80th percentile = 167 minutes - 101.9 minutes\n80th percentile \u2248 65.1 minutes\n\nNow we need to find the interval that contains 65.1 minutes to the nearest minute. Looking at the answer options:\n\nA. 15 minutes to 319 minutes\nB. 53 minutes to 281 minutes\nC. 70 minutes to 264 minutes\nD. 91 minutes to 243 minutes\n\nThe interval that contains 65.1 minutes is C. 70 minutes to 264 minutes.",
