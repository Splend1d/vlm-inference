This is a common logical fallacy, and is often used to support the argument that correlation implies causation. However, correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and without sufficient evidence, it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between two events.\n\nIt is important to note that the fallacy of _post hoc_ is distinct from the fallacy of _antecedent_, which is the assumption that because one event occurred before another, the first event must have caused the second. The fallacy of _post hoc_ is a logical fallacy, whereas the fallacy of _antecedent_ is a fallacy of logic.",
