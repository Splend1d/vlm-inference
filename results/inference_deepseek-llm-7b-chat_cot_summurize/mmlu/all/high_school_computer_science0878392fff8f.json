In top-down development, the programmer starts with the overall system design and then breaks it down into smaller, more manageable components. In this case, the Book class is the first component to be implemented, and then the LibraryList class is implemented based on the Book class. This approach ensures that the system is designed and implemented in a structured and organized manner. Answer: A. top-down development",
