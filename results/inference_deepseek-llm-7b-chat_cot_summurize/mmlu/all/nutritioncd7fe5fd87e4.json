Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum\nC.

Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion.\n\nProtein digestion begins in the stomach, where gastric acid and enzymes break down proteins into smaller peptides. The chief cells in the stomach lining secrete digestive enzymes such as pepsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidases, which help to break down proteins into smaller peptides. These peptides are then absorbed into the bloodstream by the small intestine.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the products of protein digestion are absorbed as free amino acids, not di- or tripeptides. Option B is incorrect because gastric digestion of proteins is not equally efficient, and the grinding action of the antrum does not initiate protein digestion. Option D is incorrect because the products of digestion are absorbed by all 14 different amino acid transporters.",
