I and II only\nB. II and III only\nC. II and IV only\nD. II III and IV only\n\nassistant:The answer is D. II III and IV only.\n\nInflation can affect different groups of people in various ways. Among the groups mentioned, borrowers at fixed interest rates and individuals on fixed incomes are directly impacted by inflation. As the cost of goods and services increases, the purchasing power of a fixed income decreases, leading to a decrease in the real value of the income. Similarly, borrowers at fixed interest rates may find that their loan payments increase as the cost of borrowing rises, leading to a decrease in the real value of their loan.\n\nRestaurant owners are also affected by inflation, as the rising cost of goods and services can lead to a decrease in their profits. This is because the prices of their ingredients and supplies may increase, while they may not be able to pass on the full cost increase to their customers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because borrowers at fixed interest rates and individuals on fixed incomes are both affected by inflation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while individuals on fixed incomes are affected by inflation, restaurant owners are also affected by it.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while individuals on fixed incomes are affected by inflation, restaurant owners are also affected by it.",
