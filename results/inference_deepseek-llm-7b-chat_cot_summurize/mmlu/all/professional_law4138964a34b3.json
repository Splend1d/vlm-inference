Jones responded by mailing a letter on March 10, which stated \"I accept but would like to request that I can pay $25,000 in three equal installments over the next three years.\" Berg received the letter on March 15.\n\nA contract is formed when the offeree (Jones) accepts the offer (Berg) made by the offeror (Berg) in a valid manner. Acceptance of an offer is a manifestation of agreement to all the terms and conditions of the offer, including any additional requests or conditions.\n\nIn this case, Jones accepted the offer by stating that he accepts the terms of the offer but with a request to pay the $25,000 in three equal installments over the next three years. This request was not a condition that Berg had to agree to, as it did not affect the essential terms of the offer. Therefore, Jones' request does not render the acceptance invalid.\n\nSince Jones' letter contained an acceptance of the offer, and Berg received it on March 15, the contract was formed on March 15.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Formed on March 15.",
