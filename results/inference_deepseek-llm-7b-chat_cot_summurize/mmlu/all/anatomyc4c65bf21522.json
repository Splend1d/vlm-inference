When food enters the oral cavity, the tongue pushes it towards the back of the mouth, and the epiglottis rises to cover the opening of the larynx. This prevents food from entering the airway and reaching the lungs. If the epiglottis did not move upward, food particles could enter the larynx and cause choking or respiratory problems.",
