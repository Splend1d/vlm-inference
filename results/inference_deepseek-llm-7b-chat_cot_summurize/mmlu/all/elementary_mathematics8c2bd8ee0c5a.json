Therefore, the set A. {10, 15, 20} cannot satisfy the inequality since all of its values are greater than 5.5.\n\nNow, let's check the other sets:\n\nB. {5, 7, 9}: 5 < 5.5 (False), 7 < 5.5 (False), and 9 < 5.5 (False).\nC. {4, 6, 8}: 4 < 5.5 (False), 6 < 5.5 (False), and 8 < 5.5 (False).\nD. {2, 3, 4}: 2 < 5.5 (False), 3 < 5.5 (False), and 4 < 5.5 (False).\n\nNone of the sets A, B, C, or D satisfy the inequality 2x - 1 < 10.",
