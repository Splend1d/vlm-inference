Consequential damages, since the green ink cartridges were unique because they were the last of their kind to be offered for sale by the supplier.\n\nThe supplier had made a commitment to fill the customer's order and had prepared the green ink cartridges for shipment. The customer's cancellation of the order led to the supplier being unable to sell the entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price, which could have resulted in lost profits for the supplier. Therefore, the supplier should be entitled to recover consequential damages, which would include the loss of potential profits from the sale of the green ink cartridges.",
