The field has a strength of \u03c0/4 tesla and is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. What is the particle\u2019s mass if it has a cyclotron frequency of 1,600 hertz?\n\nA. 2.5 * 10^-23 kg\nB. 1.2 * 10^-22 kg\nC. 3.3 * 10^-22 kg\nD. 5.0 * 10^-21 kg\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the following equations:\n\n1. The cyclotron frequency (f) can be used to calculate the cyclotron radius (R) using the following equation:\n\nf = (1/2\u03c0) * (B * R^2 / m)\n\n2. The cyclotron frequency can also be used to calculate the mass of the particle (m) using the following equation:\n\nm = R^2 * f^2\n\nWe are given the cyclotron frequency (f = 1,600 Hz), the magnetic field strength (B = \u03c0/4 T), and we need to find the mass of the particle (m).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cyclotron radius (R) using the given cyclotron frequency and magnetic field strength:\n\n1.6 * 10^6 Hz = (1/2\u03c0) * (\u03c0/4 * R^2 / m)\n\nR^2 = (2\u03c0f) * (m / (\u03c0/4))\n\nR^2 = (2 * 1.6 * 10^6) * (m / (\u03c0/4))\n\nR^2 = 4.166666667 * (m / (\u03c0/4))\n\nNow, we can use the equation m = R^2 * f^2 to solve for the mass of the particle:\n\nm = (4.166666667 * (m / (\u03c0/4))) * (1,600^2)\n\nm = 4.166666667 * (m / (\u03c0/4)) * (23,040)\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by the reciprocal of the first fraction:\n\nm = 4.166666667 * (m * (\u03c0/4)) * (1 / 4.166666667)\n\nm = (m * (\u03c0/16)) * (1 / 4.166666667)\n\nNow, we can solve for m:\n\nm = (\u03c0/16) * (1 / 4.166666667)\n\nm = (\u03c0/16) * (10^(-4))\n\nm = (\u03c0/65536)\n\nm = 3.3 * 10^-22 kg\n\nSo, the mass of the particle is 3.3 * 10^-22 kg, which corresponds to option C.",
