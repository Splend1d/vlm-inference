Thirteen of the boxes contain pencils, nine of the boxes contain pens, and three of the boxes contain neither pens nor pencils. How many boxes contain both pens and pencils?\n\nA. 5\nB. 2\nC. 13\nD. 139\n\nassistant:Let's denote the number of boxes containing both pens and pencils as x.\n\nWe know that:\n1. 13 boxes contain pencils\n2. 9 boxes contain pens\n3. 3 boxes contain neither pens nor pencils\n\nSince the boxes can contain only one of the two items, the total number of boxes containing either pens or pencils must be a multiple of 2 (since there are 2 options: pens or pencils).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nTotal boxes containing pens or pencils = (Number of boxes containing pencils) + (Number of boxes containing pens) - (Number of boxes containing both pens and pencils)\n\n13 + 9 - x = Total boxes containing pens or pencils\n22 - x = Total boxes containing pens or pencils\n\nWe also know that the total number of boxes is 20, and the number of boxes containing neither pens nor pencils is 3:\n\nTotal boxes = Number of boxes containing pencils + Number of boxes containing pens + Number of boxes containing both pens and pencils + Number of boxes containing neither pens nor pencils\n\n20 = 13 + 9 + x + 3\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n20 - 3 = 13 + 9 + x\n17 = 22 + x\nx = 5\n\nSo the answer is A. 5 boxes contain both pens and pencils.",
