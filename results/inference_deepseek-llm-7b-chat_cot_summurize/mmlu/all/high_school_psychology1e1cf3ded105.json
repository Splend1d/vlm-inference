GABA\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. endorphins - Endorphins are the body's natural pain-relievers, but they are not chemically similar to narcotics.\n\nB. hormones - Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate various functions in the body, but they are not chemically similar to narcotics.\n\nC. secretions - This option is too vague, as it does not specify any particular type of secretion.\n\nD. GABA - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve activity in the brain. Narcotics are chemically similar to GABA, as they bind to the same receptors in the brain that GABA does.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. GABA. Narcotics work because they are chemically very similar to GABA, binding to the same receptors in the brain and blocking pain signals.",
