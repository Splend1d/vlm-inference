What amount is the company's direct labor rate variance for March?\n\nA. $18,000\nB. $22,500\nC. $25,000\nD. $40,500\n\nassistant:To calculate the direct labor rate variance, we need to find the difference between the standard direct labor cost per unit and the actual direct labor cost per unit.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the standard direct labor cost per unit.\nStandard direct labor cost = Standard wage per hour * Direct labor hours per unit\nStandard direct labor cost = $20 * 2.4 = $48\n\nStep 2: Calculate the actual direct labor cost per unit.\nActual direct labor cost = Actual wage per hour * Actual labor hours per unit\nActual direct labor cost = $21 * 2.5 = $52.50\n\nStep 3: Calculate the direct labor rate variance.\nDirect labor rate variance = (Standard direct labor cost - Actual direct labor cost) * Number of units\nDirect labor rate variance = ($48 - $52.50) * 9,000\nDirect labor rate variance = ($48 - $52.50) * 9,000 = $40,500\n\nThe company's direct labor rate variance for March is $40,500, which corresponds to option D.",
