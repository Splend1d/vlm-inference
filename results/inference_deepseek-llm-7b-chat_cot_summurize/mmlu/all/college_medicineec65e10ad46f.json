This process helps maintain proper pH levels in the muscle and prevent excessive acid buildup. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Cotransport mechanism with carnosine: This is not a well-established process. Carnosine helps buffer lactic acid, but it does not directly facilitate the movement of lactic acid and hydrogen ions out of the muscle.\n\nC. Protein transporter molecule: While some proteins may play a role in transporting ions, this option does not accurately describe the active transport mechanism that helps remove lactate and hydrogen ions from the muscle.\n\nD. Simple diffusion: This is not a suitable mechanism for removing lactate and hydrogen ions from the muscle. Simple diffusion refers to the passive movement of molecules across a membrane, which is not sufficient to remove these ions at the necessary rate.",
