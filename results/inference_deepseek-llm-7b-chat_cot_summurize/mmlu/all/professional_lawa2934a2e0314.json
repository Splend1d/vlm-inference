When the woman moved to another state, a man took possession of the tract. The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract.

The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12years, or nine years after the son attains the ageof 18.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\n\nExplanation: According to the statute of adverse possession, the man must have possessed the land for 20 years to acquire title. However, the son's guardian discovered the man's possession 9 years after the woman's death, which means there are still 11 years left for the man to comply with the statute. Additionally, the son is still a minor, and he will not attain the age of majority until he reaches 18 years old. Therefore, the man will not acquire title until he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.",
