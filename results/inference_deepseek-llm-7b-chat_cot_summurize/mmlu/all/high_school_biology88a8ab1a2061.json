For what environment would this plant most likely be best adapted?\n\nA. Cold and rainy\nB. Humid and sunny\nC. Hot and humid\nD. Hot and dry\n\nassistant:A plant with an unusually low number of stomata is likely to have adaptations that allow it to conserve water in its environment. In this case, the plant would most likely be best adapted to a hot and dry environment. This is because stomata are responsible for allowing a plant to exchange gases, including water, and in a hot and dry environment, the plant would need to conserve water to avoid losing too much.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Hot and dry.",
