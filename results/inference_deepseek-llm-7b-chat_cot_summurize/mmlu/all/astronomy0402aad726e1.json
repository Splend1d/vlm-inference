When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. When the solar nebula formed a disk, materials naturally segregated into bands. In our particular solar system, denser materials settled nearer the Sun, while lighter materials are found in the outer part. The other options do not accurately explain the difference in density between the inner and outer planets.",
