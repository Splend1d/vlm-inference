A school provides a laptop or tablet computer to all students enrolled at the school.\n\nThis school policy is most likely to have a positive impact on the digital divide because it ensures that all students have access to the necessary technology for their education. This helps to level the playing field and reduce the disparities in access to technology that can contribute to the digital divide.\n\nA. This policy only benefits students who are able to bring a graphing calculator from home, which may not be feasible for all students.\n\nB. While this policy allows students to participate in graded quizzes on a tablet computer, it does not necessarily address the underlying issue of access to technology.\n\nD. This policy may encourage students to purchase more powerful computers, but it does not ensure that all students have access to technology in the first place.",
