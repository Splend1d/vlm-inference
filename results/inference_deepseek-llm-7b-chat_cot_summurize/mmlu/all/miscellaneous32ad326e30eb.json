What is the straight-line depreciation that can be taken for the first year of ownership?\n\nA. 1500\nB. 1667\nC. 2000\nD. 2250\n\nassistant:To calculate the straight-line depreciation for the first year of ownership, we can use the formula:\n\nDepreciation = (Total cost - Salvage value) / Total useful life\n\nIn this case, the total cost of the tractor is $40,000, the salvage value is $10,000, and the useful life is 20 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDepreciation = ($40,000 - $10,000) / 20\nDepreciation = $30,000 / 20\nDepreciation = $1500\n\nSo the answer is A. 1500.",
