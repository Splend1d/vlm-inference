Transform data to zero mean\n\nTo get the same projection as SVD, you need to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data. In PCA, the first step is to transform the data to have a zero mean. This ensures that the data is centered around zero, and the PCA algorithm can focus on the variance and covariance between the data points.\n\nSVD, on the other hand, does not require the data to have a zero mean, as it is a different method for decomposing the data into its constituent vectors. However, if you perform SVD on centered data, it will give the same results as PCA.\n\nThe other options (B. Transform data to zero median and D. None of these) are incorrect because they do not address the issue of ensuring that the data is centered around zero, which is necessary for PCA and SVD to produce the same results.",
