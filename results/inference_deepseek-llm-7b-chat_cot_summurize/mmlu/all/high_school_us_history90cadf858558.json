Sumner's ideas reflect the survival of the fittest and the success of individuals who are able to meet the requirements of certain work. This suggests that during this time, cultural and intellectual arguments may have been used to justify the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: A. cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.\n\nThis answer is supported by the text, which mentions that \"The millionaires are a product of natural selection, acting on the whole body of men to pick out those who can meet the requirement of certain work to be done.\" This implies that successful individuals were seen as having met the requirements for their role in society, and thus their success was justified by the prevailing cultural and intellectual arguments of the time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the text does not mention popular writers rejecting ideas from the sciences or basing their arguments on faith. Option C is incorrect because the text does not mention intellectuals proposing radical alternatives based on creating a cooperative economy. Option D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that cultural products of the era looked back wistfully to the past.",
