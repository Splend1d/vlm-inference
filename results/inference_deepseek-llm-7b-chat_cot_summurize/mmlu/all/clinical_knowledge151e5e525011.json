The contraction of the left ventricle forces the blood through the aorta and into the circulatory system.\n\nA. The atria are contracting: This is not the correct answer, as the atria are the upper chambers of the heart and are responsible for receiving blood from the veins.\n\nB. The vessels are contracted: This is not the correct answer, as the vessels are the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart, and contractions of the vessels would impede blood flow.\n\nC. The right ventricle is relaxed: This is not the correct answer, as the right ventricle is the opposite of the left ventricle and pumps blood into the lungs for oxygenation.\n\nD. The arteries have elastic recoil: This is the correct answer, as arteries have a property called elastic recoil, which allows them to recoil or return to their normal shape after being stretched by the blood flow. This recoil helps to maintain the blood flow in the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle.\n\nSo, the blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle because the arteries have elastic recoil.",
