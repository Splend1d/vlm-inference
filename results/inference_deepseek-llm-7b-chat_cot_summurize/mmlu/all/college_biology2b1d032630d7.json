Western blot hybridization\nB. Northern blot hybridization\nC. Southern blot hybridization\nD. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This technique is used to demonstrate protein binding to specific DNA sequences by measuring the mobility shift of DNA in an electrophoresis gel. It can be used to detect and quantify the interaction between a DNA probe and a target DNA sequence, as well as other proteins such as transcription factors and histones. A, B, and C are not the correct answers because they are techniques used for detecting and analyzing RNA molecules, not proteins.",
