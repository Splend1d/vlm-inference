She was diagnosed with Turner syndrome in infancy during a work-up for coarctation of the aorta. During today's visit, her mother reports that the girl has been talking about babies. You have been the patient's physician for the past 6 years and know she is prepubescent. It is most appropriate to counsel the patient that if she wishes to have a family she will need to do which of the following?\n\nA. Adopt\nB. Have amniocentesis if she gets pregnant\nC. Have an operation\nD. Receive genetic counseling\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Receive genetic counseling.\n\nTurner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects only females. It is caused by the absence or complete deletion of one of the sex chromosomes (usually the X chromosome). The symptoms of Turner syndrome vary depending on the severity of the X chromosome deletion, but common symptoms include growth delays, short stature, heart defects, and developmental delays.\n\nThe patient's mother reports that the girl has been talking about babies, which suggests that she may be considering having a family in the future. As the patient's physician, it is important to counsel her about her options and potential risks.\n\nOption A, adopting, is not a viable option for the patient as she would not be able to conceive naturally.\n\nOption B, having amniocentesis if she gets pregnant, is not relevant to the patient's current situation as she is not pregnant and has not expressed any desire to become pregnant.\n\nOption C, having an operation, is not a viable option for the patient as it would not address her desire to have a family.\n\nOption D, receiving genetic counseling, is the most appropriate course of action for the patient. Genetic counseling can help the patient understand the risks and potential outcomes associated with Turner syndrome, as well as her options for having a family. It can also provide information about potential treatments and management options for any health issues that may arise as a result of the syndrome.",
