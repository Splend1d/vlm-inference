Before a big football game with their arch rival, the defendant attended a pep rally at the university football field.

The parking enforcement officer who witnessed the incident and provided the police with the defendant's license number played a significant role in his case. The police, after learning the defendant's identity and home address, forcibly entered his house within an hour of the incident. The defendant was studying in an upstairs bedroom when the police arrived.\n\nThe defendant was given his Miranda warnings before he confessed to the crime. The question that arises is whether the motion to suppress evidence of the statement he made to the police should be granted. The options provided are:\n\nA. denied, because the defendant received Miranda warnings and was not compelled to incriminate himself.\nB. denied, because the defendant volunteered the confession.\nC. sustained, because the police lacked probable cause to search the defendant's home.\nD. sustained, because the defendant's statement was the product of a warrantless entry of his home.\n\nThe correct answer is C. sustained, because the police lacked probable cause to search the defendant's home.\n\nThe police officers' entry into the defendant's home without a search warrant was unlawful. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. The police must have probable cause to search a person's home, and probable cause is a high standard that requires more than just a hunch or suspicion. In this case, the parking enforcement officer's witness of the defendant urinating in public provided information to the police, but it was not enough to establish probable cause for a search warrant.\n\nMoreover, the police did not have probable cause to enter the defendant's home without a search warrant. The fact that the defendant was a person of interest in a criminal investigation does not automatically grant the police the right to search his home. The police's actions in this case violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights and any evidence obtained as a result of this unlawful search should be suppressed.\n\nIn conclusion, the motion to suppress evidence of the statement made by the defendant should be sustained. The police's entry into the defendant's home without a search warrant was unlawful and violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The defendant's statement should be excluded from evidence because it was the product of a warrantless entry into his home.",
