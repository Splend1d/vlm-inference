Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.\nII. Combinational circuits have a \"memoryless\" property; sequential circuits do not.\nIII. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. I and II only\nD. II and III only\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each statement and compare it with the correct options.\n\nStatement I: Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.\nThis statement is false. Combinational circuits can have feedback, and sequential circuits can also have feedback. Feedback is a common feature in both types of circuits.\n\nStatement II: Combinational circuits have a \"memoryless\" property; sequential circuits do not.\nThis statement is true. Combinational circuits perform a function on the input and produce an output, without storing any information from previous inputs. In contrast, sequential circuits have memory and can store information from previous inputs, which is why they are called \"non-memoryless\".\n\nStatement III: Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\nThis statement is false. While it is common to use an external clock to synchronize the operation of sequential circuits, combinational circuits do not necessarily require an external clock. They can operate based on input signals alone, without any external timing mechanism.\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer is B. II only, as only statement II is true and contains information that is not false according to statement I or III.",
