Many people send contributions. The charity is using a technique known as\n\nA. overcompensation\nB. foot-in-the-door phenomenon\nC. the bystander effect\nD. proximity\n\nassistant:The charity is using the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. This is a social psychology term that describes how people are more likely to agree to a larger request if they have first agreed to a smaller one. In this case, the charity initially asked for a decal to be displayed on a window, and then later sent envelopes requesting contributions. The small initial request (\"display a decal on a window\") serves as the \"foot-in-the-door\" that leads to the larger request (\"make a contribution\").",
