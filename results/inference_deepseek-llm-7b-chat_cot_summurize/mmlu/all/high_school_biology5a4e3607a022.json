A yeast cell that is fed on glucose is moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment. Which of the following statements is correct and gives the correct reason for it?\n\nA. The cell dies because it cannot make ATP.\nB. The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\nD. The cell will begin to divide rapidly because larger cells require more oxygen and glucose than smaller ones.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\n\nWhen a yeast cell is fed on glucose, it undergoes aerobic respiration, which produces ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through the process of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. However, when the cell is moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, it cannot continue with the aerobic respiration process and will switch to anaerobic respiration.\n\nDuring anaerobic respiration, the yeast cell breaks down glucose without the presence of oxygen. This process produces only a fraction of the ATP produced by aerobic respiration, and it also produces lactic acid as a byproduct. Since the anaerobic process is less efficient than aerobic respiration, the cell would need to consume another food source, such as another sugar molecule like fructose, to produce the required amount of ATP for the cell's needs.",
