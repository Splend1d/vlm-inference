II and III only\nD. I only\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. I and II only.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe given interval (0.45, 0.80) for the slope of the regression line indicates that there is a 95% confidence that the true slope of the regression line lies between 0.45 and 0.80. This does not necessarily mean that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables or that the true slope of the regression line is 0.\n\nThe presence of a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line indicates that there is good evidence of a linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables. However, this does not provide strong evidence for the existence of a non-zero correlation (r) or the true slope being 0.",
