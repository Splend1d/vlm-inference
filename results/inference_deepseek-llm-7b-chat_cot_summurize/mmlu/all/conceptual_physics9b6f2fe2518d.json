Energy.\n\nA wave transfers energy, which is the ability to do work or cause a change in a system. The other options are related to the properties of the wave itself, such as amplitude (height of the wave) and wavelength (distance between consecutive peaks or troughs), while frequency (number of oscillations per unit time) is related to the rate at which the wave is created or received.",
