This is because Ann initially sold a one-half interest in the land to Hunter and Willa, and then later sold the remaining one-half interest to Hunter and Brandon. When Hunter, Willa, and Brandon died in a common disaster, their interests were divided according to their wills. Hunter's will and Willa's will devised an interest in the land to their son, which means the son inherited one-half of the original interest sold to Hunter and Willa, making a total of one-half interest in the land. The correct answer is C. an undivided one-half interest in the land.",
