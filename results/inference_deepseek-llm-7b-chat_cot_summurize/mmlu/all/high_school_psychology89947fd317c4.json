This phenomenon refers to the improvement in performance that occurs when individuals are observed or watched while they perform a task. In this case, the presence of another runner serves as a social stimulus that motivates the runners to perform at a higher level.\n\nSocial facilitation can be contrasted with social inhibition, which occurs when the presence of an observer hinders performance. Social facilitation is often observed in various contexts, including sports, work tasks, and other performance-based activities.\n\nOther options B, C, and D do not accurately describe the phenomenon illustrated in the scenario provided. Conformity refers to the tendency of individuals to assimilate to group norms and values, while deindividuation refers to the loss of a sense of self and responsibility when individuals are part of a large group. Norms, on the other hand, are simply general rules or standards that govern behavior in a given context, without directly referring to the observed increase in performance.",
