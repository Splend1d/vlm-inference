If A = A^(-1), then the trace of A is\n\nA. 2\nB. 1\nC. 0\nD. -1\n\nassistant:Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nGiven A = A^(-1), we know that A is its own inverse. Therefore, A = A^T.\n\nA = A^T\n\nWe can expand this as follows:\n\nAA^T = A^T A^T\n\nSince A is a square matrix, its transpose A^T is also a square matrix. Therefore, we can multiply them together:\n\nAA^T = A^T A\n\nNow, let's focus on the trace of A, which is the sum of the diagonal elements of A.\n\nTrace(A) = d1 + d2\n\nSince A = A^T, we can see that the diagonal elements of A^T are the same as the diagonal elements of A. Let's denote them as d1 and d2.\n\nTrace(A) = d1 + d1\n\nSince d1 and d1 are the same, we can say:\n\nTrace(A) = 2d1\n\nNow, let's look at the options given:\n\nA. 2\nB. 1\nC. 0\nD. -1\n\nSince we know that the trace of A is 2d1, and since d1 is a real number, the only option that satisfies this condition is A. 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 2.",
