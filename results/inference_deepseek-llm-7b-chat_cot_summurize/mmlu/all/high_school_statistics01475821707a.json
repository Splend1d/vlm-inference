The number of heads in three tosses of a coin\nB. The number of rainy days in a given week\nC. The number of girls in a family of five children\nD. The number of students present in a class of 22\n\nassistant:A binomial model is used to model the probability of success (or failure) in a fixed number of independent trials. In the given situations:\n\nA. The number of heads in three tosses of a coin: This is a binomial model because there are fixed number of trials (3 tosses) and the outcome (number of heads) can be either 0 or 1.\n\nB. The number of rainy days in a given week: This is not a binomial model because the number of rainy days in a week can be any value between 0 and 7 (inclusive), and it is not a fixed number.\n\nC. The number of girls in a family of five children: This is a binomial model because there are fixed number of trials (5 children) and the outcome (number of girls) can be either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nD. The number of students present in a class of 22: This is a binomial model because there are fixed number of trials (22 students) and the outcome (number of students present) can be either 0, 1, 2, ..., 22.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The number of rainy days in a given week is not an appropriate model to describe the outcome.",
