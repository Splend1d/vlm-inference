They mention that the first maxim of one's policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. They also say that terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, and inflexible, and that it is an emanation of virtue. This suggests that the speaker views counterrevolutionary opponents as a significant threat to the Republic.",
