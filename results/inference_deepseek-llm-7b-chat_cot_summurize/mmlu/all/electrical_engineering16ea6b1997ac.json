This can be explained from which theorem\n\nA. Reciprocity theorem\nB. Thevinin's theorem\nC. Norton's theorem\nD. Compensation theorem\n\nassistant:The balanced bridge that the user is referring to is a concept in electrical engineering, specifically in the field of alternating current (AC) circuits. The question is asking for the theorem that explains the property of the balanced bridge that allows it to remain balanced when the positions of the detector and source are interchanged.\n\nAfter researching the balanced bridge and its related theorems, I can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\nD. Compensation theorem\n\nThe compensation theorem states that if the impedance of a circuit is changed, the voltage across the impedance is changed in such a way that the power lost is minimized. In the context of the balanced bridge, this means that when the positions of the detector and source are interchanged, the circuit can be rebalanced by adjusting the impedance of the components in the circuit, allowing the bridge to remain balanced.",
