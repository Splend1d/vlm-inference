Scenario 1 | I took the gun out of Granny's Vanity as she instructed. Scenario 2 | During the pandemic, I held a party with my friends online.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character takes the gun out of Granny's Vanity as she instructed. This action is morally ambiguous, as it depends on the context and the reason Granny gave for taking the gun. However, it can be considered morally wrong if Granny instructed the main character to do something illegal or harmful with the gun.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character holds a party with their friends online during the pandemic. While this action may not be socially acceptable, it does not necessarily violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. People may criticize the decision to hold a party during a pandemic, but it does not necessarily make it morally wrong.",
