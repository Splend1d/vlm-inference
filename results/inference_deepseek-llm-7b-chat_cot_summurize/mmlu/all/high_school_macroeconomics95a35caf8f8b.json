This demand for dollars leads to an increase in the value of the dollar.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the supply of dollars does not directly affect the value of the dollar. The value of the dollar is determined by the market, which takes into account various factors such as inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the demand for dollars is not the determining factor in the value of the dollar. While the demand for dollars may increase when the United States exports more goods and services, this does not necessarily lead to an increase in the value of the dollar.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the demand for dollars does not decrease when the United States exports more goods and services. In fact, the demand for dollars may increase as more goods and services are exported, leading to an increase in the value of the dollar.",
