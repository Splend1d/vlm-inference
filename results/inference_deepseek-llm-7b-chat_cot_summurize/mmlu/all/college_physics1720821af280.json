At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\n\nA. 414 Hz\nB. 427 Hz\nC. 433 Hz\nD. 440 Hz\n\nassistant:Let's denote the speed of sound as s, the speed of the sound wave in the pipe as v, and the wavelength as \u03bb. We know that v = s * f, where f is the frequency of the sound wave, and \u03bb = h / f. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C. The speed of sound is affected by temperature, with a typical linear relation between temperature and speed of sound: s(T) = s0 + s0\u0394T/293, where s0 is the speed of sound at 0\u00b0C, and \u0394T is the temperature difference. \n\nFor 20\u00b0C, we have:\n\ns(20\u00b0C) = 343 m/s + 343 m/s * (20\u00b0C - 0\u00b0C) / 293 K\n\nSolving for s(20\u00b0C) = 343 + 343 * (20 / 293) = 343 + 343 * 7 / 293 = 343 + 343 * 0.246 = 343 + 83.168 = 426.168 m/s\n\nNow, let's find the speed of the sound wave in the pipe (v):\n\nv = s * f\n\nWe know that the pipe resonates at 440 Hz, so f = 440 Hz.\n\nv = 426.168 m/s * 440 Hz = 186,814.72 m\u00b2/s\n\nNow, let's find the wavelength (\u03bb) of the sound wave in the pipe:\n\n\u03bb = h / f\n\nWe know that the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C, so the new speed of sound is:\n\ns(cold day) = 343 m/s + 343 m/s * (20\u00b0C - 0\u00b0C) / 293 K * (1 - 0.03)\n\nSolving for s(cold day) = 343 + 343 * (20 / 293) * (1 - 0.03) = 343 + 343 * 0.7015 = 343 + 240.255 = 583.255 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the speed of the sound wave in the cold day pipe:\n\nv = s * f\n\nv = 583.255 m/s * 440 Hz = 245,108.4 m\u00b2/s\n\nFinally, let's find the new frequency (f_cold day) of the pipe resonance:\n\n\u03bb = h / f\n\nh = \u03bb * f\n\nWe know that the frequency of the pipe resonance is 440 Hz, so:\n\n440 Hz = h / f_cold day\n\nSolving for f_cold day = 440 Hz / 4 = 110 Hz\n\nNow that we have the new frequency, we can calculate the new resonant frequency:\n\nf_cold day = 245,108.4 m\u00b2/s / 110 Hz = 2228.26 m/s\n\nTherefore, the pipe resonates at a frequency of 110 Hz on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C. The answer is C. 433 Hz.",
