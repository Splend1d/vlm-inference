Since these two events are mutually exclusive (the student can only be in one of these two situations), we can find the probability of B by subtracting the probability of A' from 1:\n\nP(B) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20\n\nNow we can find the probability of A' \u2229 B:\n\nP(A' \u2229 B) = P(A') * P(B) = 0.80 * 0.20 = 0.16\n\nHowever, none of the given answer choices match this probability.
