Decreasing federal income tax rates in the 1980\n\nassistant:The goals presented in the excerpt are about establishing new provisions and regulations for improving revenue and extending and securing navigation and commerce between Great Britain and the American colonies, and raising revenue in the colonies to defray the expenses of defending and protecting them.\n\nA. Antitrust reforms of the Progressive Era: This option is not similar to the goals presented in the excerpt because it is about regulating business practices and monopolies, not about improving revenue or defending and protecting colonies.\n\nB. Free trade policies of the 1970s: This option is not similar to the goals presented in the excerpt because it is about promoting free trade between countries, not about improving revenue or defending and protecting colonies.\n\nC. Increasing federal income tax rates after World War I: This option is not similar to the goals presented in the excerpt because it is about increasing taxes, not about establishing new provisions and regulations for improving revenue and defending and protecting colonies.\n\nD. Decreasing federal income tax rates in the 1980s: This option is similar to the goals presented in the excerpt because it is about establishing new provisions and regulations for improving revenue, and this time it is about decreasing taxes rather than increasing them. Therefore, option D is the best answer.",
