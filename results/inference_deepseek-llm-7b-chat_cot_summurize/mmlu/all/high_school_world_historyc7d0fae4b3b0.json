The colonization of Africa\n\nassistant:The development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution led to the development of new technologies and the increased production of goods, including textiles and other items that the Portuguese were importing to China. This increased competition in the global market led to a decrease in the value of silver, which was the primary currency being used for trade between Portugal and Japan. As a result, the Portuguese were no longer able to profit as much from their trade routes to Japan, and the trade patterns described in the passage were significantly altered.\n\nThe other options are not as directly related to the changes in trade patterns mentioned in the passage. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants could have affected the trade patterns, but it is not as directly related to the changes in the global market as the Industrial Revolution. The Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas and the colonization of Africa were both significant events during this period, but they are not as directly related to the changes in trade patterns between Portugal and China.",
