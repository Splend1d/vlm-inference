Divide the larger number (55) by the smaller number (25) and find the remainder.\n55 \ufffd 25 = 2 with a remainder of 10\n\n2. Replace the larger number (55) with the smaller number (25) and the smaller number with the remainder (10).\nNow we need to find the GCD of 25 and 10.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (25) by the new smaller number (10) and find the remainder.\n25 \ufffd 10 = 2 with a remainder of 5\n\n4. Replace the larger number (25) with the smaller number (10) and the smaller number with the remainder (5).\nNow we need to find the GCD of 10 and 5.\n\n5. Divide the new larger number (10) by the new smaller number (5) and find the remainder.\n10 \ufffd 5 = 2 with a remainder of 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the GCD of 25 and 55 is the last non-zero remainder, which is 5.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 11.",
