September 15, year 2.\n\nIf a taxpayer dies and no extension is filed, the estate tax return (Form 706) must be filed within nine months after the date of death. In this case, the taxpayer died on May 15, so the due date would be February 15 of the following year (February 15, year 3). However, since it is already May, the due date would be September 15 of the same year (September 15, year 2).",
