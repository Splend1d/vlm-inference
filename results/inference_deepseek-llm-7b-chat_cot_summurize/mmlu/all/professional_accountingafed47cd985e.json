Which of the following adjustments should be made when recording the stock dividend?\n\nA. Treasury stock is debited for $300.\nB. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\nC. Retained earnings is debited for $300.\nD. Common stock is debited for $3,000.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nWhen a company declares a stock dividend, it does not increase the amount of money the company has. Instead, it increases the number of shares that each outstanding share is divided into. In this case, the company is increasing the number of shares outstanding from 1,000 to 1,333.33. This means that each share of $1 par common stock is being split into three shares of $3.33.\n\nTherefore, the additional paid-in capital should be credited for $2,700 ($3.33 \\* 800). The treasury stock adjustment is not necessary because the company is not acquiring the additional shares. Retained earnings should not be debited because the stock dividend does not affect the company's retained earnings.",
