Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories\n\nassistant:The passage provided by the user is a quote from Frederick Douglass, an African American abolitionist and former slave. The passage discusses the complete organization of the slaveholders and the various institutions that support and propagate slavery. The user's question refers to the Dred Scott v. Sandford case, which was a landmark Supreme Court case that dealt with the status of African Americans and the extent of the federal government's power to regulate slavery.\n\nThe correct answer to the question is D. Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories. In the Dred Scott v. Sandford case, Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that African Americans were not entitled to the protections of the U.S. Constitution, and that Congress did not have the power to prohibit slavery in the territories. This decision was widely criticized and is considered one of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court.",
