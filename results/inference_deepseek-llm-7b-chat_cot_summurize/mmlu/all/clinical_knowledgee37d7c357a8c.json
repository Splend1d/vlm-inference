For a 65 kg person, how many milligrams will they receive in an hour?\n\nA. 156\nB. 15.6\nC. 1.56\nD. 15600\n\nassistant:To calculate the dose of dopamine, we can use the following formula:\n\ndose = rate \u00d7 weight \u00d7 time\n\nwhere dose is the amount of medication in milligrams, rate is the dose per kilogram per minute, weight is the person's weight in kilograms, and time is the time in minutes.\n\nGiven the rate of 4 micrograms/kg/min and a weight of 65 kg, we can calculate the dose as follows:\n\ndose = (4 \u00d7 65 \u00d7 60) / 1000\n\ndose = (27600) / 1000\n\ndose = 27.6 mg\n\nThe closest answer to the calculated dose is option B, 15.6 mg.",
