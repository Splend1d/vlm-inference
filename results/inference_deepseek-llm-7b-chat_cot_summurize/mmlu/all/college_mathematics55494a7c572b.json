To find the number of ordered pairs (x, y) such that x < y, we can consider the possible values of x and find the corresponding values of y.\n\nIf x = 0, the maximum value of y is 3, so there are 3 possible pairs (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2).\n\nIf x = 1, the maximum value of y is 2.99, so there is 1 possible pair (1, 1.99).\n\nIf x = 2, the maximum value of y is 2.49, so there are 1 possible pair (2, 2.49).\n\nIf x = 3, the maximum value of y is 2.4, so there is 1 possible pair (3, 2.4).\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 ordered pairs (x, y) such that x < y.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of ordered pairs (x, y) in the given intervals:\n\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 12 ordered pairs (x, y) in the given intervals.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of ordered pairs (x < y)) / (Total number of ordered pairs (x, y))\nProbability = 6 / 12\nProbability = 1 / 2\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 1/2.",
