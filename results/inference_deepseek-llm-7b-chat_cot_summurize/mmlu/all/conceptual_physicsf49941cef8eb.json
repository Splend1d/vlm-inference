Therefore, the answer is D. natural frequency.\n\nWhen you tap a piece of wood, it produces a characteristic sound due to the vibrations of its molecules. The frequency of these vibrations is determined by the natural frequency of the wood, which is influenced by its material properties, such as density and stiffness. The amplitude and wavelength of the sound waves generated by the tapping are also related to the natural frequency, but the fundamental property that determines the characteristic sound of the wood is its natural frequency.",
