C4 grasses that may have included wild wheat.\n\nassistant:The answer is B. meat derived from carnivorous mammals. The teeth of the hominid species found in Malapa Cave exhibit a combination of features that suggest a diet primarily composed of meat. These features include:\n\n1. Large canines: These teeth are used for tearing flesh, indicating that the hominid species was capable of hunting and consuming meat.\n2. Smaller molars: The molars are smaller in size compared to other hominid species, which suggests that they were not as important in the process of breaking down plant material.\n3. Grinding surfaces: The molars have grinding surfaces, which could have been used to process plant material, but the presence of large canines and the overall size of the teeth suggests that meat was the primary source of food.\n\nBased on these features, it is likely that the hominid species from Malapa Cave was primarily a carnivore, relying on meat derived from carnivorous mammals for their diet.",
