Layer Normalization is used in the original ResNet paper, not Batch Normalization.\nStatement 2: True. DCGANs use self-attention to stabilize training.\n\nLayer Normalization and Batch Normalization are both normalization techniques used in neural networks. They are often confused, but they are different. Layer Normalization was proposed in the original ResNet paper, which was published in 2015 by the Facebook AI Research group. On the other hand, Batch Normalization was proposed in the same year, in the paper \"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift.\"\n\nDCGANs (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) are a type of generative adversarial network, a class of machine learning models that can generate new examples that resemble a given dataset. DCGANs do indeed use self-attention mechanisms to stabilize training. Self-attention is a technique that allows a neural network to \"attend\" to different parts of the input sequence and weigh their importance when making a prediction. It has been used in various generative models, including DCGANs, to improve their performance and stability during training.",
