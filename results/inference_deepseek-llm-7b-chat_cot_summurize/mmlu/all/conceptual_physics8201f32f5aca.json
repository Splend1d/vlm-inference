Need more information.\n\nassistant:A. increases.\n\nAs more lamps are connected in parallel in a circuit, the total resistance in the circuit will decrease. This is because each lamp is connected in parallel, which means that the current will be distributed evenly among all the lamps. Since the total resistance is now lower, the current flowing through the power source will increase.",
