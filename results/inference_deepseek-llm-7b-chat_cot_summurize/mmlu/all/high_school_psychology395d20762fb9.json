It is the basic building block of words, and consists of one or more letters or sounds that combine to form a meaningful unit. For example, in the word \"run\", the morphemes are \"run\" and \"ing\", which together form the meaning of the word.\n\nAn option B, word, is not the smallest unit of language that carries meaning, as words are composed of morphemes. An option A, concept, is not the smallest unit of language that carries meaning, as concepts are abstract ideas and not directly related to language. An option C, phoneme, is a unit of sound in a language, not meaning.",
