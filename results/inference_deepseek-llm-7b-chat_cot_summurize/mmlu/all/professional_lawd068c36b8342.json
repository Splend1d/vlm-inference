The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee.

In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend.

Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by\n\nA. the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.\nB. the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.\nC. the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.\nD. the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The deed absolute did not extinguish the investor's right of redemption.\n\nThe investor executed a mortgage on the building before the deed absolute, and the mortgage took precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time. Therefore, the investor should be granted the relief sought, but only if they can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute.\n\nThe investor's failure to pay the promissory note at maturity resulted in the deed absolute being delivered to the friend, but this did not extinguish the investor's right of redemption. The investor's right of redemption was still in effect, and they were able to tender the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend two weeks later. Therefore, the friend's counterclaim that the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor is incorrect.\n\nThe friend's argument that the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement is also incorrect. The escrow arrangement does not affect the priority of the mortgage over the deed absolute.\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by the investor, but only if they can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.",
