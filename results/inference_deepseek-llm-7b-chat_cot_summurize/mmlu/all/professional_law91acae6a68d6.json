The intention was to enforce a residential use of the property so that the intended change in use will not be allowed.\n\nThe restriction in the plat limitation is clear: \"no structure shall be built except for dwelling purposes.\" This wording is unambiguous and specifically restricts the type of structure that can be built on the property. Since a dwelling has been built on the lot, it is clear that the structure was built for residential purposes.\n\nAttempting to change the intended use of the dwelling to a dental office would be a violation of the plat restriction. The court would likely grant the request to prohibit the intended use as it would be in violation of the plat restriction.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The wording is not ambiguous, and the restriction is clear.\nB. The wording does not restrict the building of the structure, only its intended use.\nD. A professional use cannot be prohibited by a land restriction, but this would not apply in this case as the intended use is in violation of the plat restriction.",
