No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.\nD. No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.\n\nThe court dismissed the case because the owner did not have a property interest that was affected by the cancellation of her license and permits. This means that she did not have a legal right to own and operate a massage parlor, and the state was within its rights to revoke her license and permits. The fact that she had a business and customers does not give her a property interest in her license and permits.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the substantive due process clause guarantees certain fundamental rights, such as the right to earn a living. In this case, the owner was not deprived of a fundamental right, but rather a license and permits that were not protected by the due process clause.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the state's interest in protecting the public from illegal activities does not necessarily justify the state's actions. The state must also follow due process when taking away someone's property.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the owner's license and permits were not automatically renewed. The state was within its rights to cancel them.",
