The congressional act always prevails\nB. The valid treaty always prevails\nC. The last in time prevails\nD. The president decides\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first identify the relevant parts of the question: congressional act, valid treaty, and resolution.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question\nThe user is asking how a conflict between a congressional act and a valid treaty is resolved.\n\nStep 2: Identify the answer\nThe correct answer is B. The valid treaty always prevails.\n\nJustification: When there is a conflict between a congressional act and a valid treaty, the treaty takes precedence because it is an international agreement that the United States is legally bound to uphold. The Constitution specifically grants the President the power to enter into treaties, and these treaties have the force of law. On the other hand, Congress has the power to pass laws, including congressional acts. However, if a congressional act conflicts with a valid treaty, the treaty prevails.",
