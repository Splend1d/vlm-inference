Kant's moral philosophy is based on the idea that the supreme principle of morality is the categorical imperative, which is a moral principle that is universal, self-sufficient, and independent of any particular circumstances.\n\nThe categorical imperative can be understood in two forms: the formulation in terms of a universal law, and the formulation in terms of a maxim. The first formulation states that one should act only in accordance with that maxim which can at the same time be made into a universal law. This means that an action is morally right if it can be applied to all people in all situations. The second formulation states that one should always treat humanity as an end and never as a means.\n\nAccording to Kant, the categorical imperative is synthetic because it is based on the experience of the world and the way that things actually are. It is also a priori because it is not derived from experience, but is a priori knowledge that is innate to the human mind. This means that it is not dependent on experience or the senses, but is a priori knowledge that can be known independently of any experience.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. synthetic and a priori.",
