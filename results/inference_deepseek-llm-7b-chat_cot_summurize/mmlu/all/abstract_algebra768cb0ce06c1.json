Statement 2 | If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If G, H and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic.\n- True. This is because the order of a group is the number of its elements. Since there are 4 elements in a group of order 4, there must be at least two elements that are distinct. If two distinct elements exist in a group, it means they have different orders (e.g., 1 and 2 are distinct in Z_4). Therefore, one group must have a non-trivial element (e.g., 2 in Z_4), which implies that the other group (e.g., Z_4) must have an isomorphic subgroup.\n\nStatement 2: If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n- True. This is because if we have two groups Z_r + Z_s and Z_m + Z_n, both of which are isomorphic, then there must be a bijective map between their elements. In other words, there is a correspondence between the elements in Z_r + Z_s and Z_m + Z_n. This implies that there is some integer k such that m = kr and n = ks. Since m and n are the orders of the groups, it follows that r and s must divide m and n, respectively.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, and the answer is A. True, True.",
