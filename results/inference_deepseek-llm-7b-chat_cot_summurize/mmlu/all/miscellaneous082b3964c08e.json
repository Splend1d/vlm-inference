Cell membrane\nB. Cytoplasm\nC. Guard cell\nD. Cellulose\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Guard cell.\n\nA guard cell is a plant cell that helps control the passage of materials into and out of the stomates, which are the tiny openings on the surface of plant cells through which they exchange gases with the environment. The guard cells are located in the stoma and are responsible for regulating the size of the stoma, which affects the amount of gas exchange that occurs.",
