While this is not morally right, it is not clearly morally wrong either. The excitement may be due to a thrill-seeking nature or an adrenaline rush, but it is not something that is universally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character draws their friend skydiving. While it is true that skydiving can be dangerous, it is not necessarily morally wrong. It is a personal choice and can be done with proper safety measures. Therefore, it is not clearly morally wrong.",
