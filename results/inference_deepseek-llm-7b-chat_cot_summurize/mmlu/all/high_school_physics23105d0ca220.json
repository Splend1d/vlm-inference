Spring-block oscillator\n2. Maximum speed\n3. Block\n4. Amplitude\n\nNow, I will search my knowledge base for information related to spring-block oscillators and their properties.\n\nFrom my knowledge base, I find that in a spring-block oscillator, the maximum speed of the block is inversely proportional to the square root of amplitude. This means that as the amplitude increases, the maximum speed of the block decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Inversely proportional to the square root of amplitude.",
