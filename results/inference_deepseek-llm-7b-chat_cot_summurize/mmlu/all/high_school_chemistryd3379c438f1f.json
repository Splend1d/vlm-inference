CaCl2\nB. CuCl2\nC. AlBr3\nD. K2Cr2O7\n\nassistant:To determine which of the following should be named using Roman numerals after the cation, we need to identify the cation in each compound and then determine which one requires Roman numeral naming.\n\n1. CaCl2 - The cation is Ca2+. This compound does not require Roman numeral naming.\n2. CuCl2 - The cation is Cu2+. This compound does not require Roman numeral naming.\n3. AlBr3 - The cation is Al3+. This compound requires Roman numeral naming.\n4. K2Cr2O7 - The cation is K+. This compound does not require Roman numeral naming.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound that should be named using Roman numerals after the cation is AlBr3.",
