It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\n\nA. 9/2 days\nB. 5 days\nC. 41/8 days\nD. 36/7 days\n\nassistant:Let k and j be the number of days it takes Kate and John, respectively, to write a GRE math practice test.\n\nWhen Kate starts, the total number of days it takes to complete the practice test is 10 days.\nKate works for 10 days, and John works for 10.5 days.\n\nThis can be represented by the equation:\nk + 1.5j = 10\n\nWhen John starts, the total number of days it takes to complete the practice test is 10.5 days.\nKate works for 10 days, and John works for 10.5 - 10 = 0.5 days.\n\nThis can be represented by the equation:\nj + k = 10.5\n\nWe can solve the system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate j:\n(j + k) - (k + 1.5j) = 10.5 - 10\n0.5 - 1.5j = 0.5\n-1.5j = 0\nj = 0\n\nSince j = 0, the first equation becomes:\nk + 1.5(0) = 10\nk = 10\n\nTherefore, when Kate and John work simultaneously, it would take them 10 days to complete a practice test.
