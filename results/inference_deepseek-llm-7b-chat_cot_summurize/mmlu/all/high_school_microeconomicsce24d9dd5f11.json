In a cartel, firms agree to set prices and production levels to maximize their profits. However, because cartels are illegal in many countries, cartel firms face significant risks and penalties for being caught cheating on the cartel agreement. As a result, cartels often face the temptation to cheat in order to gain an advantage over their competitors. This can lead to a lack of trust and cooperation within the cartel, which can ultimately undermine the cartel's ability to achieve its goals.",
