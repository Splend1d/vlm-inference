The given polynomial is x^3 + 2x + 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the factors of the polynomial:\nx^3 + 2x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4)\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx + 1 = 0 => x = -1 (mod 7)\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2 (mod 7)\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4 (mod 7)\n\nNow, let's find the values in the finite field Z_7 that satisfy these equations:\n-1 (mod 7) = 6 (since 6 is the only multiple of 7 that is congruent to -1)\n-2 (mod 7) = 3 (since 3 is the only multiple of 7 that is congruent to -2)\n-4 (mod 7) = 1 (since 1 is the only multiple of 7 that is congruent to -4)\n\nSo, the values of x that make the polynomial equal to zero are 6, 3, and 1 in the finite field Z_7. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 2,3.",
