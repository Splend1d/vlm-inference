She keeps 7 of the coins in a box, which is only 5% of her entire collection. What is the total number of coins in Kate\u2019s coin collection?\n\nA. 12\nB. 14\nC. 120\nD. 140\n\nassistant:Let's use the information given to find the total number of coins in Kate's collection.\n\nWe know that 7 coins is 5% of her entire collection. To find the total number of coins, we need to determine what 100% is.\n\nSince 7 coins is 5% of the collection, we can set up the equation:\n\n7 coins = 0.05 * total coins\n\nNow, we can solve for the total number of coins:\n\ntotal coins = 7 coins / 0.05\ntotal coins = 140 coins\n\nSo, the total number of coins in Kate's collection is 140 (option D).",
