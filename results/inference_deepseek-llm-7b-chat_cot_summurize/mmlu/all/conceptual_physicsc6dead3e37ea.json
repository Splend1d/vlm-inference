All of these.\nD. None of these.\n\nassistant:B. wavelength.\n\nLight reflects from a smooth surface, and the change in wavelength is known as the Fresnel reflection. The change in wavelength occurs because the light waves are bent as they pass through the air and then enter the smooth surface. The change in wavelength depends on the angle of incidence and the type of surface.",
