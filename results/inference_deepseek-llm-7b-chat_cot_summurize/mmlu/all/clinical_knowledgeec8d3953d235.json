However, it is generally accepted that blood loss of around 20-30% can lead to a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. It is important to note that the severity of hypovolaemic shock and the response to treatment may vary depending on the underlying cause of the blood loss and the individual patient's condition.",
