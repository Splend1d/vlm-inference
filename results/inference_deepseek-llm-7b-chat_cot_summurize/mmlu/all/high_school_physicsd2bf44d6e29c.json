Find the stone's total speed when it enters the water 4 seconds later, assuming that air resistance is negligible.\n\nA. 30 m/s\nB. 40 m/s\nC. 50 m/s\nD. 60 m/s\n\nassistant:Let's denote the initial horizontal speed of the stone as u. Since air resistance is negligible, the horizontal speed remains constant during the 4-second period. The stone's initial speed is 30 m/s, so u = 30 m/s.\n\nWe can use the equation of motion to find the total speed of the stone when it enters the water:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately -9.81 m/s^2), and s is the time taken (4 seconds).\n\nv^2 = (30 m/s)^2 + 2(-9.81 m/s^2)(4 s)\nv^2 = 900 m^2/s^2 - 78.48 m/s^2\nv^2 = 161.52 m^2/s^2\nv = \u221a161.52\nv \u2248 34.7 m/s\n\nThe total speed of the stone when it enters the water is approximately 34.7 m/s. Therefore, the answer is A. 30 m/s.",
