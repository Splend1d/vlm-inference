Not be contained in a form supplied by the offeror.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. In order to have an irrevocable offer under the Uniform Commercial Code, the offer must be contained in a signed writing which gives assurance that the offer will be held open. This is because the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) requires an offer to be irrevocable if it is made by a merchant to a merchant, and a signed writing is one way to give assurance that the offer will be held open.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the UCC does not require the offeree to be a merchant.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the UCC does not require the offer to state the period of time for which it is irrevocable.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the UCC does not require the offer to be contained in a form supplied by the offeror.",
