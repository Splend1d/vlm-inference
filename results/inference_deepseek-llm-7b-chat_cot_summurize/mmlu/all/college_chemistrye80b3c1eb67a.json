If the actual concentration of the titrated solution is 0.100 M, which of the following is true about the titration results?\n\nA. Accurate but not precise\nB. Precise but not accurate\nC. Both accurate and precise\nD. Neither accurate nor precise\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Both accurate and precise.\n\nExplanation:\nThe mean result of the five titrations is 0.110 M, which is close to the actual concentration of 0.100 M. Therefore, the results are accurate.\n\nThe standard deviation of the five titrations is 0.001 M, which is very small compared to the mean result. This indicates that the results are precise.\n\nTherefore, the student's results are both accurate and precise.",
