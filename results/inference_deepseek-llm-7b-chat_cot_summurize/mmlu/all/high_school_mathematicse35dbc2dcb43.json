How many degrees are in the measure of an interior angle of this sign?\n\nA. 90\nB. 135\nC. 45\nD. 180\n\nassistant:To determine the number of degrees in the measure of an interior angle of the regular octagon, we can use the formula for the measure of an interior angle of a regular polygon:\n\nInterior angle = 180\u00b0 * (n - 2) / n\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nFor an octagon (8 sides), the formula becomes:\n\nInterior angle = 180\u00b0 * (8 - 2) / 8\nInterior angle = 180\u00b0 * 6 / 8\nInterior angle = 90\u00b0 * 6 / 4\nInterior angle = 135\u00b0\n\nSo, the measure of an interior angle of the sign outside Bob's Burger Barn is 135 degrees. The correct answer is B.",
