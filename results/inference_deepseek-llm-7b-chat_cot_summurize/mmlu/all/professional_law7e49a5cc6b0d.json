The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress.

Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress. \u0080\u0083\n\nassistant:The hospital is likely to be held liable to the widow. The answer is D. The hospital's negligent handling of the husband's body, by misidentifying and cremating it instead of sending it to the funeral home for burial as requested by the widow, was especially likely to cause her serious emotional distress. The fact that she was never in any danger of bodily harm or that she did not witness the cremation is not necessarily relevant to the hospital's liability for causing her emotional distress. The hospital's responsibility is to properly dispose of corpses, and their failure to do so in this case caused the widow significant emotional distress. Therefore, the hospital is likely to be held liable to the widow.",
