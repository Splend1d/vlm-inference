Na2SO4 + Ba(NO3)2 \u2192 BaSO4 + NaSO4\nB. AgNO3 + K2CrO4 \u2192 Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3\nC. 5 FeCl2 + 8 HCl + KMnO4 \u2192 5 FeCl3 + MnCl2 + 4 H2O + KCl\nD. Al(NO3)3 + 3 KOH \u2192 Al(OH)3 + KNO3\n\nassistant:A balanced chemical reaction is one in which the number of atoms of each element involved in the reaction is equal on both sides.\n\nFor option A, Na2SO4 + Ba(NO3)2 \u2192 BaSO4 + NaSO4, the atoms are not balanced. The coefficient of NaSO4 is 2 while the coefficient of BaSO4 is 1. This implies that 2 Na atoms are reacting with 1 Ba atom. The coefficient of NaSO4 should be 1 to balance the reaction.\n\nOption B, AgNO3 + K2CrO4 \u2192 Ag2CrO4 + 2 KNO3, is also not balanced. The coefficient of AgNO3 is 1 while the coefficient of Ag2CrO4 is 2. This implies that 1 Ag atom is reacting with 2 Cr atoms. The coefficient of AgNO3 should be 2 to balance the reaction.\n\nOption C, 5 FeCl2 + 8 HCl + KMnO4 \u2192 5 FeCl3 + MnCl2 + 4 H2O + KCl, is not balanced. The coefficient of FeCl3 is 5 while the coefficient of MnCl2 is 2. This implies that 5 Fe atoms are reacting with 2 Mn atoms. The coefficient of FeCl3 should be 2 to balance the reaction.\n\nOption D, Al(NO3)3 + 3 KOH \u2192 Al(OH)3 + KNO3, is balanced. The atoms are equal on both sides, and the coefficients of Al and K match.\n\nTherefore, the balanced chemical reaction is option D, Al(NO3)3 + 3 KOH \u2192 Al(OH)3 + KNO3.",
