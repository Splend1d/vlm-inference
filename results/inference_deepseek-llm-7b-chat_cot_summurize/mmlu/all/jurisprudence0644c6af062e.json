Society has no right to preserve its moral and social cohesion through the criminal law.\n\nThis proposition is the most powerful refutation because it challenges the core of Lord Devlin's argument, which is that the law should protect society's moral and social cohesion. By stating that society has no right to preserve its moral and social cohesion through the criminal law, Hart effectively undermines Devlin's claim that the law should be used to maintain social order.\n\nThe other propositions do not directly refute Lord Devlin's argument as strongly as option A. Proposition B, which states that homosexual acts cause public outrage, is more of a statement about public opinion rather than a direct refutation of Devlin's argument. Proposition C, which suggests that the courts are the best place to resolve moral questions, does not necessarily contradict Devlin's argument about the role of the law in maintaining social order. Finally, proposition D, which suggests that the law is anachronistic, is a critique of the law rather than a direct refutation of Devlin's argument.",
