P stands for the price level and V stands for the velocity of money.\n\nassistant:The equation of exchange is: MV = PQ. Here, M represents the total money supply in an economy, V represents the velocity of money, P represents the price level, and Q represents the total amount of goods and services produced and sold in an economy. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. P stands for the price level and V stands for the velocity of money.",
