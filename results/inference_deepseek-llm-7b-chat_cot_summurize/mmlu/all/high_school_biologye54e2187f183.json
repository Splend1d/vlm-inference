The fungi penetrate the roots of the flower and take advantage of the plant's food resources. The fungi concentrate rare minerals, such as phosphates, in the roots and make them readily accessible to the orchid. This situation is an example of\n\nA. parasitism\nB. commensalism\nC. mutualism\nD. endosymbiosis\n\nassistant:The situation described is an example of mutualism. Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit from the interaction. In this case, the calypso orchid and the mycorrhizae fungi both benefit from their association. The orchid gets access to rare minerals through the fungi, while the fungi get the sugars produced by the orchid in exchange. This mutually beneficial relationship is different from parasitism, where one organism (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other organism (the host). Commensalism is also different, as the organism benefiting from the relationship does not affect the other organism. In endosymbiosis, an organism acquires another organism and keeps it inside its own cells, which is not applicable in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is C. mutualism.",
