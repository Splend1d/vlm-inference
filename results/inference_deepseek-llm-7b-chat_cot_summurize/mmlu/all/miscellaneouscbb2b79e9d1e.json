It is a large, round citrus fruit that is similar in size and shape to a grapefruit, but with a thicker skin and a sweeter, more delicate flavor. The name \"shaddock\" comes from the fact that the fruit was first cultivated in the Shad Thames district of London, England. Today, shaddocks are grown in many parts of the world, including the Caribbean, South America, and the United States. They are often used in the same way as grapefruits, in recipes and as a healthy snack.\n\nThe correct answer is D. a grapefruit.",
