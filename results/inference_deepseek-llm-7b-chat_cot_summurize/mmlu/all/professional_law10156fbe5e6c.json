After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:\"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000.

The Statute of Frauds states that certain types of contracts, such as loans, must be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the investor's promise to lend $100,000 was made orally, which does not satisfy the Statute of Frauds and therefore cannot be enforced. Therefore, the correct answer is C. lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.\n\nHowever, if the developer can prove that the investor's promise to lend the money was made in writing and satisfies the Statute of Frauds, then the developer would have a stronger case to enforce the promise. In this case, the developer would win, as the memorandum in the written agreement satisfies the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, the correct answer in this case would be A. win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\n\nThe fact that land is unique is not a relevant factor in determining whether the promise to lend money satisfies the Statute of Frauds. The detrimental reliance on the investor's promise is also not a relevant factor as the promise is not a binding contract.",
