There are 85 teachers on staff. How many possible speaking lineups can the principal have?\n\nA. 592,620\nB. 592,704\nC. 614,125\nD. 614,126\n\nassistant:To calculate the number of possible speaking lineups, you can use the concept of permutations. In this case, you need to choose 3 teachers out of 85 to speak at the graduation ceremony.\n\nThe number of permutations is given by the formula:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of teachers (85) and r is the number of teachers to be chosen (3).\n\nP(85, 3) = 85! / (85 - 3)!\nP(85, 3) = 85! / 82!\n\nNow, we can calculate the value:\n\n85! / 82! = 614,126\n\nSo, the number of possible speaking lineups is 614,126, which corresponds to answer choice D.",
