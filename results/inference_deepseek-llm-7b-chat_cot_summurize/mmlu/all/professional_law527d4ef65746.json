In 2007, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due, but the promise was made to the daughter and not to the mortgage company. Therefore, the mortgage company is not a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter. Additionally, the mortgage company cannot rely on an implied delegation of duties to the daughter, as the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of a property transfer.",
