The coronary arteries arise from the arch of the aorta and fill during diastole. This means that they receive blood during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, when the heart is relaxed and filling with blood. The other options are incorrect because they describe the filling of the ascending aorta, which is not the same as the coronary arteries.",
