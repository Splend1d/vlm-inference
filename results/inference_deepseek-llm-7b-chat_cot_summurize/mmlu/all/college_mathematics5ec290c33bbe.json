What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?\n\nA. 2/81\nB. 1/18\nC. 2/27\nD. 1/9\n\nassistant:Let's denote the probability of rolling an odd number as P(odd) and the probability of rolling an even number as P(even). We are given that P(even) = 2 * P(odd). We also know that the probability of rolling a 5 or a 6 is the sum of the probabilities of rolling each of these numbers individually.\n\nThe sum of the probabilities of rolling a 5 or a 6 is P(5) + P(6) = 1/36. Since the probabilities of rolling a 5 or a 6 are equal, P(5) = P(6) = 1/36.\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find P(odd). We know that P(even) = 2 * P(odd), so P(odd) = P(even) / 2 = 1/36 / 2 = 1/72.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll, which is the sum of the probabilities of rolling a 5 and a 6: P(5) + P(6) = 1/36 + 1/36 = 2/36 = 1/18.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 1/18.",
