This means that the husband, who inherited the lemon grove from his deceased wife, is still liable for the mortgage given to the bank. The unrecorded mortgage given to the bank in 1990 remains valid, and the husband defaulted on his mortgage obligation to his sister, which indicates his inability to pay the mortgage on the lemon grove. Therefore, the court should rule in favor of the bank and order the foreclosure of the lemon grove.",
