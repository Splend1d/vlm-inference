Higher levels of imported goods\nB. Lower levels of consumer wealth\nC. A higher real interest rate\nD. Lower taxes on personal income\n\nassistant:A higher real interest rate would increase the aggregate demand function. The aggregate demand function is the relationship between the total amount of goods and services produced in an economy and the total amount of money people are willing to spend. When interest rates are high, people tend to save more money, which reduces the amount of money available for spending. This reduces aggregate demand and can cause a decrease in economic activity. However, when interest rates are low, people are more likely to spend their money, which increases aggregate demand and can lead to an increase in economic activity. Therefore, a higher real interest rate would increase the aggregate demand function.",
