The defendant sold a pack of cigarettes to a girl who was 17 years of age, and before selling the product to the girl, he carefully examined the girl's driver's license, which indicated that she was, in fact, 17 years old. However, the defendant erroneously believed the age of majority to be 17.\n\nAccording to the statute, violation of the statute is considered a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail. The defendant's mistake is honestly held to have been made, as he erroneously believed the age of majority to be 17.\n\nGiven the above information, the correct answer is D. The result of the defendant's conviction should be his acquittal because he did not possess the requisite mens rea. Mens rea, which means \"guilty mind\" in Latin, refers to the mental state or intention of the defendant at the time of the crime. In this case, the defendant believed he was not violating the statute due to his honest mistake about the age of majority. As a result, his lack of guilty mind or mens rea should result in his acquittal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. result in his acquittal, because he did not possess the requisite mens rea.",
