Which of the following most likely represents her family's parenting style?\n\nA. Minimal supervision\nB. Permissive\nC. Authoritarian\nD. Authoritative\n\nassistant:Carlotta is a well-adjusted, socially competent adolescent. This suggests that her family's parenting style is likely Authoritative.\n\nAuthoritative parenting is characterized by high levels of warmth and support, as well as high levels of expectations and limits. Parents in this style are typically involved in their children's lives, but also allow them some degree of independence and decision-making. This approach has been shown to lead to well-adjusted, successful children who are able to form positive relationships and achieve their goals.\n\nIn contrast, Permissive parenting involves low levels of warmth and support, as well as low levels of expectations and limits. Permissive parents tend to be lenient and often avoid setting boundaries, which can lead to children who are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and have difficulty forming healthy relationships.\n\nMinimal supervision parenting involves low levels of warmth, support, expectations, and limits. Parents in this style tend to be detached and may not be as involved in their children's lives. This approach can lead to children who are more likely to experience emotional and behavioral problems.\n\nAuthoritarian parenting involves high levels of warmth and support, but also high levels of expectations and limits. Parents in this style tend to be strict and may not allow their children much freedom or decision-making. This approach can lead to children who are more likely to be rebellious and have difficulty forming healthy relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, given that Carlotta is a well-adjusted, socially competent adolescent, it is most likely that her family's parenting style is Authoritative.",
