Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n\nThe court will consider outside evidence to determine the true intention of the parties, as long as it does not violate any rules of evidence. In this case, the side agreement and the parties' intentions during negotiations can be considered as evidence to supplement the ambiguous clause in the deed. Therefore, the court may find that the seller still has an absolute right to travel over the forty-foot strip of land for certain purposes, despite the buyer's claims.",
