Lack of mental capacity.\n\nassistant:It is difficult to determine which defense would be successful in a suit alleging negligence by a CPA without more context and information about the specific allegations and circumstances of the case. However, some defenses that may be relevant in such a case include:\n\n* Due care: The CPA may be able to argue that they took reasonable steps to prevent the alleged negligence from occurring.\n* Ignorance of the law: The CPA may be able to argue that they were not aware of the relevant legal requirements and therefore did not intentionally engage in negligent behavior.\n* Lack of intent: The CPA may be able to argue that they did not intend to cause harm or engage in negligent behavior.\n* Lack of mental capacity: The CPA may be able to argue that they were not in a position to understand the legal requirements or make informed decisions due to a mental or cognitive impairment.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific defenses that may be available in a given case will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. A qualified attorney with expertise in negligence law would be best equipped to advise on the specific defenses that may be available in a particular case.",
