Which combination of mass and charge would result in a circular path with the largest radius?\n\nA. m = 16 u, q = \u20135 e\nB. m = 17 u, q = \u20134 e\nC. m = 18 u, q = \u20133 e\nD. m = 20 u, q = \u20131 e\n\nassistant:To determine which combination of mass and charge will result in the largest radius for the circular path, we can use the formula for the centripetal acceleration of the isotope:\n\na = v^2 / r\n\nwhere a is the centripetal acceleration, v is the speed of the isotope, and r is the radius of the circular path.\n\nFirst, we can use the formula for the centripetal acceleration of an object in a circular path:\n\na = (mv^2) / (rB)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nFor this problem, the isotope's initial velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, so we can simplify the equation to:\n\na = mv^2 / rB\n\nNow, we can use this equation to find the radius r in terms of the mass m and charge q of each isotope:\n\nrB = mv^2 / a\nr = (mv^2) / (aB)\n\nSince we want to find the isotope with the largest radius, we can plug in the centripetal acceleration equation into the radius equation:\n\nr = (mv^2) / (aB)\n\nNow, we can compare the values of r for each isotope:\n\nA. m = 16 u, q = \u20135 e\nrA = (16 * (-5e)^2) / (aB)\n\nB. m = 17 u, q = \u20134 e\nrB = (17 * (-4e)^2) / (aB)\n\nC. m = 18 u, q = \u20133 e\nrC = (18 * (-3e)^2) / (aB)\n\nD. m = 20 u, q = \u20131 e\nrD = (20 * (-1e)^2) / (aB)\n\nTo find the largest radius, we need to find the maximum value of r for each isotope. Since the centripetal acceleration is constant, we can set the numerator of each equation equal to the centripetal acceleration:\n\n(mv^2) / (aB) = a\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = (mv^2) / (aB)\n\nNow, we can find the maximum value of r by taking the derivative of r with respect to m and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndr/dm = 0\n\nTaking the derivative of r with respect to m, we get:\n\nd(r) / d(m) = 0\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm = 20 u\n\nNow, we can plug this value of m back into the equation for r:\n\nr = (20 * (-1e)^2) / (aB)\n\nTo find the maximum value of r, we need to find the minimum value of B. Since the magnetic field is uniform, we can assume that the isotope's initial velocity is parallel to B, so the centripetal acceleration is zero. In this case, we have:\n\na = 0\n\nr = (20 * (-1e)^2) / (0B)\n\nr = 20 * (-1e)^2\n\nr = 20\n\nThus, the isotope combination with the largest radius is m = 20 u, q = \u20131 e, and the largest radius is 20.",
