Every apartment is bigger than some house.\nB. Every house is bigger than all apartments.\nC. Every house is bigger than some apartment.\nD. Some house is bigger than every apartment.\n\nassistant:The translation key given is Lx: x is large. This means that the proposition will have an element that is large.\n\nThe proposition is: (\u2200x)[Ax \u2283 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)].\n\nThis can be translated to: \"For every x, if x is an apartment (Ax), then there exists a y such that y is a house (Hy) and x is bigger than y (Bxy).\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Every apartment is bigger than some house.\nB. Every house is bigger than all apartments.\nC. Every house is bigger than some apartment.\nD. Some house is bigger than every apartment.\n\nSince the proposition states that if x is an apartment, there exists a y such that y is a house and x is bigger than y, it means that some houses are bigger than some apartments. Therefore, the best English interpretation is:\n\nC. Every house is bigger than some apartment.",
