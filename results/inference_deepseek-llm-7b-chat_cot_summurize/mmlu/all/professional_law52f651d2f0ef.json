The law prohibited the issuance of a license to felons and mentally ill persons or others presenting a danger of violence. It prohibited the commercial sale of guns from residential locations and required a commercial permit. Certain semi-automatic weapons were prohibited. A citizen who wished to purchase and maintain various guns in a manner violative of the statute sued the state.

However, it is important to note that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the right to own firearms for self-defense and other lawful purposes, but it also recognizes the need for reasonable regulation. Therefore, the Court may consider whether the statute in question is a reasonable regulation that does not unduly infringe on the right to possess firearms for self-defense.",
