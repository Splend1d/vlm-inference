At the beginning of the current year the city spent $800000 on new roads. The roads have a 20-year useful life. What amount should Large City report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year?\n\nA. $0\nB. $20,000\nC. $40,000\nD. 800000\n\nassistant:To determine the amount Large City should report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year, we can use the following formula:\n\nAnnual expense = (Original cost - Depreciation expense) * Useful life\n\nFirst, we need to find the accumulated depreciation expense. The city spent $800,000 on new roads at the beginning of the year, and the roads have a 20-year useful life. So, the accumulated depreciation for the first year would be:\n\nAccumulated depreciation = Original cost - Annual expense\nAccumulated depreciation = $800,000 - (Annual expense * Useful life)\n\nSince we don't have the annual expense, we cannot calculate the accumulated depreciation. However, we can try to estimate the annual expense using the information provided.\n\nThe useful life of the roads is 20 years, and the city spent $800,000 on them at the beginning of the year. To estimate the annual expense, we can use a useful life ratio, which is the proportion of the original cost that is depreciated each year.\n\nAnnual expense = Original cost * Useful life ratio\nAnnual expense = $800,000 * 20\nAnnual expense \u2248 $16,000,000\n\nNow, let's check the given options:\n\nA. $0: This seems incorrect as the city spent $800,000 on the roads and the annual expense is estimated to be around $16,000,000.\nB. $20,000: This seems incorrect as the annual expense is estimated to be around $16,000,000.\nC. $40,000: This seems incorrect as the annual expense is estimated to be around $16,000,000.\nD. $800,000: This is the original cost of the roads, not the annual expense.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot accurately determine the annual expense, but we can estimate it to be around $16,000,000.",
