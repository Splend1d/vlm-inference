Yes, because he could not be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime. The defense argues that it is legally impossible to commit the crime of conspiracy to violate election bribery laws because the agents were not registered to vote in the district and they never intended to allow a crime to be committed. Therefore, the defense's motion to dismiss the charges against the campaign worker is likely to be granted.",
