Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nThe federal statute extends federal minimum wage requirements to all dry cleaning stores, and the statute contains express findings that the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. Since the small dry cleaning store operates exclusively within a community in the center of a geographically large state and has no customers from outside the state, it may seem that it does no business in interstate commerce. However, the wages paid to its three workers still have a substantial impact on interstate commerce, as they are a part of the larger economic system that contributes to the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. Therefore, the small dry cleaning store must comply with the statute imposing the federal minimum wage requirements on all dry cleaning stores.",
