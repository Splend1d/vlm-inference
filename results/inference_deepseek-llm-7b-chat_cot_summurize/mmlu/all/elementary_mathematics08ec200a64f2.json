The total cost for four tickets is $112. Write and solve an equation to find the cost of one ticket t.\n\nA. 4t = 112; $448\nB. 4t = 112; $28\nC. t over 4 = 112; $448\nD. t over 4 = 112; $28\n\nassistant:To find the cost of one ticket, we can use the following equation:\n\n4t = 112\n\nTo solve for t, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\nt = 112 / 4\nt = 28\n\nSo the cost of one ticket is $28. Therefore, the answer is B. 4t = 112; $28.",
