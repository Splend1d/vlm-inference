Both options B and D could be seen as issues related to the lack of representation and involvement of Native Americans in archaeological research, but they do not directly address the ethics of conducting research on sites with human remains of indigenous North American ancestors. Option C is related to the difficulty of locating burials, but it does not directly address the ethical concerns of conducting research on such sites. Option A, however, addresses the potential for conflict and disagreement that can arise when non-indigenous archaeologists and Native Americans are present at the same time on a site with human remains. This can potentially lead to ethical issues related to the treatment and respect of the remains, and the involvement of both groups could contribute to misunderstandings and disagreements about how the site should be treated.",
