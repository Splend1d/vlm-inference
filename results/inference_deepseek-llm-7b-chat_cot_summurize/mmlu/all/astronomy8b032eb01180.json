What is the expression for the total energy released in the impact?\n\nA. m*v\nB. 0.5*m/(R^3)\nC. 0.5*m*(2GM/R)\nD. 0.6*G(M^2)/R\n\nassistant:To find the total energy released in the impact, we can use the conservation of energy. The initial kinetic energy of the comet (KE_initial) is equal to the final kinetic energy of the debris (KE_final) plus the gravitational potential energy released (PE_release).\n\nKE_initial = (1/2) * m * v^2\nPE_release = (1/2) * m * (2 * G * M / R)\n\nTotal energy released = KE_initial + PE_release\n\nTotal energy released = (1/2) * m * v^2 + (1/2) * m * (2 * G * M / R)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nTotal energy released = (1/2) * m * (v^2 + 2 * G * M / R)\n\nNow, we can see that the expression matches option C:\n\nTotal energy released = 0.5 * m * (2 * G * M / R)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.",
