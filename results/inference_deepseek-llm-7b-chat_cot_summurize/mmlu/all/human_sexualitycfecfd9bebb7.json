Intimacy refers to the emotional closeness and warmth between two people in a relationship.\nB. Commitment involves the decision to continue investing time and energy into the relationship, regardless of the challenges that may arise.\nC. Passion is the intense desire and excitement that drives the initial stages of a relationship, and can contribute to its longevity if it is maintained over time.\n\nWithout all three components, a relationship may struggle to survive and thrive. Intimacy without commitment can lead to infatuations, while commitment without passion can lead to a stagnant relationship. Passion without intimacy can lead to shallow flings, while passion without commitment can lead to a roller coaster of short-lived relationships.\n\nSo, according to Sternberg's theory, a combination of intimacy, commitment, and passion is necessary for a relationship to last.",
