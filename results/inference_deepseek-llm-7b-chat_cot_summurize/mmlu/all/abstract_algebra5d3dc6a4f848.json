The inverse of a is\n\nA. 0\nB. -2\nC. a-2\nD. (2+a)*-1\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given group operation and find the inverse of a.\n\nThe group operation is a*b = a+b+1.\n\nTo find the inverse of a, we need to find an element b in the group such that a*b = e, where e is the identity element of the group (in this case, 0).\n\nLet's try each option:\n\nA. 0:\nIf a = 0, then a*b = b+1. We need b+1 = 0, which is not possible since 0 is not an element of the group.\n\nB. -2:\nIf a = -2, then a*b = -2b-1. We need -2b-1 = 0, which is not possible since 0 is not an element of the group.\n\nC. a-2:\nIf a = 0, then a*b = b+1, and we don't have an identity element.\nIf a \u2260 0, then a*b = a-1+b+1 = a+b+1. In this case, we need b = -a, but -a is not an element of the group.\n\nD. (2+a)*-1:\nThis option is not possible because the product of a group element (2+a) with its inverse (a-2) is not an element of the group.\n\nNone of the given options provide the inverse of a.
