Yes, because the protection of child welfare is reserved to the states.\n\nassistant:The court is likely to dismiss the action. The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \"the Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" This means that states have sovereign immunity, and they cannot be sued in federal court by citizens of other states or by citizens or subjects of foreign states. In this case, the United States is suing a state in federal court for injunctive relief, which is a type of equitable relief. Since the state is a sovereign entity, the Eleventh Amendment likely bars this action, and the court may dismiss the action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the Eleventh Amendment bars actions against a state in federal court.",
