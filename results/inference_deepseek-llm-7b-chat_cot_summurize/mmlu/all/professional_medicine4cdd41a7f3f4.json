His only new complaint is pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing. He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months.

Narrowing of the hip joint\nD. Osteoporosis\n\nassistant:The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is A. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The patient's pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing, as well as the scattered bilateral basilar crackles auscultated during the physical examination, are consistent with avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Glucocorticoid therapy, which the patient has been taking for the past 6 months, can cause avascular necrosis as a side effect. Additionally, the patient's thin build and no acute distress suggest that the condition has been progressing slowly.",
