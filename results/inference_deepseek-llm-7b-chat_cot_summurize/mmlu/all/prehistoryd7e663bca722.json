Caral\nB. Stonehenge\nC. Poverty Point\nD. Gobekli Tepe\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Caral.\n\nCaral is a pre-Inca archaeological site located in the Supe Valley in the central coast of the Peruvian desert. It is known for its monumental earthworks, including concentric ridges in a semicircle that date back to around 3,500 years ago. The site consists of a series of pyramids, plazas, and other structures built using advanced architectural techniques.\n\nStonehenge, Poverty Point, and Gobekli Tepe are also important archaeological sites, but they do not have the same type of earthworks as Caral. Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in England known for its large, circular arrangement of standing stones. Poverty Point, located in Louisiana, features earthworks that include a large earthen platform, concentric rings, and a crescent-shaped dune. Gobekli Tepe, located in Turkey, is a collection of ancient stone monuments that date back to around 10,000 years ago.",
