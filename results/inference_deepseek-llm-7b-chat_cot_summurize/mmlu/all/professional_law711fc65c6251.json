During the trial, defense counsel offers the testimony of a man on death row admitting he hired another man to shoot the victim. The testimony is\n\nA. not hearsay.\nB. hearsay, but admissible as an admission.\nC. hearsay, but admissible as a dying declaration.\nD. hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nassistant:The testimony offered by defense counsel during the trial is hearsay. Hearsay is a statement that is offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the testimony of the man on death row is being used to prove that he hired another man to shoot the victim. The fact that the man on death row admitted to hiring the other man is being asserted, but not directly presented by the man on death row himself.\n\nSince the testimony is hearsay, it must meet one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule in order to be admissible in court. In this case, the testimony may be admissible as a dying declaration if it was made while the man on death row was facing imminent death or if the statement was made in the context of imminent death. A dying declaration is a statement made by a witness while the witness is facing imminent death and the statement is made as the witness's last words or as the witness believes they will be their last words.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. hearsay, but admissible as a dying declaration.",
