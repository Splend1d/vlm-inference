We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison\n\nassistant:All of the options provided can be used to compare investment projects, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nA. The ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate: This is true, as the net present value (NPV) takes into account the time value of money and does not change with changes in the market rate.\n\nB. The IRR will always agree with NPV metric: This is not always the case. The internal rate of return (IRR) is a rate of return that makes the NPV of the cash flows equal to zero. If there are changes in the market rate, the IRR could change, and therefore, it might not agree with the NPV metric.\n\nC. The IRR never changes the ranking of the projects: This is not always true. The IRR is a rate of return that makes the NPV of the cash flows equal to zero. If there are changes in the market rate, the IRR could change, and therefore, it might change the ranking of the projects.\n\nD. We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison: This is subjective and depends on the specific goals and preferences of the decision-maker. Both the NPV and IRR have their own strengths and weaknesses, and it is important to understand and consider these when making a decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that all of the options can be used to compare investment projects, and the decision-maker should consider the strengths and weaknesses of each metric and their specific goals and preferences when making a decision.",
