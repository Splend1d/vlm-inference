An increase in United States imports\nB. An increase in United States exports\nC. A decrease in the demand for the United States dollar\nD.

The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. A higher real interest rate can attract foreign capital to the United States, which can lead to an increase in exports and a decrease in imports.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. An increase in United States exports.",
