An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in arresting party's presence.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A.\n\nA misdemeanor is a less serious crime, and an officer does not need to have probable cause to arrest someone for a misdemeanor. They only need to have a reasonable suspicion that the crime has been committed. On the other hand, an officer does need to have probable cause to arrest someone for a felony, which is a more serious crime.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, as it is incorrect that an officer must have probable cause that a misdemeanor has occurred and that the person he has arrested committed it.",
