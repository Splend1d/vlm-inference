Additionally, representatives may use federal funds to publicize their achievements via direct mail to constituents, which can help them win reelection. Finally, representatives may run uncontested in some cases, which also increases their chances of winning reelection.\n\nHowever, senators have more political power than representatives, and Senate races are accordingly contested more aggressively. This means that incumbents may face more competitive races and have a harder time winning reelection.",
