You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A positive integer n is called \u201cpowerful\u201d if, for every prime factor p of n, p^2 is also a factor of n. An example of a powerful number is\n\nA. 392\nB. 336\nC. 300\nD. 297\n\nassistant:To determine which number is a powerful number, we need to check each prime factor and see if it's raised to the power of 2 is also a factor.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. 392: The prime factors of 392 are 2 and 7. Since 2^2 = 4 and 7^2 = 49, both are factors of 392, so 392 is a powerful number.\n\nB. 336: The prime factors of 336 are 2 and 7. Since 2^2 = 4, which is not a factor of 336, 336 is not a powerful number.\n\nC. 300: The prime factors of 300 are 2, 3, 5, and 10. None of the primes squared are factors of 300, so 300 is not a powerful number.\n\nD. 297: The prime factors of 297 are 3 and 33. Since 3^2 = 9, which is not a factor of 297, 297 is not a powerful number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, 392, because it is the only number among the options that is a powerful number.",
