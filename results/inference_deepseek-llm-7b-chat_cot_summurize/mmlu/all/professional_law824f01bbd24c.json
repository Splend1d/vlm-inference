Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\nD. Yes, a new company can usually collect its lost profits because it is easier to prove than if the company had many accounts to complicate its projections.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\n\nIn this case, the business was able to provide detailed sales projections, supported by expert testimony, demonstrating the substantial profit that hinged on receiving the widgets from the manufacturer. While the manufacturer's equipment failures were an unfortunate event, they were not considered an excusable occurrence, as the manufacturer was aware of the potential risk and should have taken steps to prevent it.\n\nUnder the law of contracts, a breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform its obligations under the contract. If a party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party may be entitled to recover damages for the losses it suffers as a result of the breach. In this case, the business suffered lost profits as a result of the manufacturer's breach of contract, and the business was able to provide sufficient evidence to prove its lost profits damages, including expert testimony. Therefore, the court should allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages.",
