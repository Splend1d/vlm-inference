Reduced perceived risk.\n\nThe three major outcomes from the development of relationship trust are satisfaction, reduced perceived risk, and continuity (Pavlou, 2002).

Trust also leads to a greater sense of continuity in the relationship, as the parties involved feel more secure in their interactions.",
