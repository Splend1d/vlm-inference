This type of agreement is called a \"conditional gift,\" and it is not considered a valid contract under the law. Therefore, the son would not be entitled to receive the new car, and the executor of the father's estate would not be obligated to give it to him.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the consideration, or the value received by the father, was the son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol. However, this does not make the promise legally binding.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it states that the son's promise to refrain from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration. However, as previously mentioned, a promise made under these circumstances is not considered a valid contract.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that the father's promise was only a conditional gift. However, this does not necessarily mean that the son would not be successful in recovering the car. The issue here is that the promise was not legally binding, not that it was a conditional gift.",
