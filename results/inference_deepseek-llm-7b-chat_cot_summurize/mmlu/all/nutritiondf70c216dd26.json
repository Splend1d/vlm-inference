While globalisation can provide opportunities for developing countries to increase their food production and improve their food security, it also poses challenges. Wealthy countries' subsidies and trade barriers can make it difficult for developing countries to take advantage of the potential of globalisation for advancing food security. World Trade Organisation rules do not cover agriculture, so globalisation may have limited impact on food security in this regard. On the other hand, supermarkets have indeed been affected by globalisation, but they are not the only way in which food and agriculture have experienced globalisation. Developing countries may need to create publicly-owned food reserves to realise the potential benefits of globalisation, but this is just one of many strategies that they could pursue.",
