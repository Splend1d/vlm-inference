The seller answered the complaint and included as a separate defense an allegation that the purchaser had brought and lost a similar contract claim against a different seller three years earlier, and that this history represented a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits. The purchaser believes that the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one and is therefore irrelevant.

Move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense.\nC. Move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits.\nD. Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n\nassistant:The purchaser's best response to the seller's answer would be to move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant. This is because the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one, and therefore should not be considered in the current case. The purchaser can also file a motion to strike the separate defense as an improper collateral estoppel, which is a doctrine that prevents a party from relitigating an issue that has already been resolved in a previous lawsuit. This can help to ensure that the purchaser's best interests are protected in the current case.",
