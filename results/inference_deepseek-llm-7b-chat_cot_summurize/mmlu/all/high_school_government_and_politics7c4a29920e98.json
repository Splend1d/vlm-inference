Forty percent\nB. Fifty-one percent\nC. Fifty-five percent\nD. Sixty percent\n\nassistant:To find the answer, I will search for information on the Senate confirmation process for a presidential nominee to the Supreme Court. According to the Constitution and the advice of the Senate, a nominee must receive a \"Supreme Court Nomination\" or \"Supreme Court Justice Nomination\" to be confirmed. Based on the information available, I found that the nominee must receive a \"majority of the whole number of Senators and a majority of the Senators chosen by each State\" in order to be confirmed. This means that the nominee must receive more than 50% of the votes in the Senate to be confirmed.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Fifty-one percent.",
