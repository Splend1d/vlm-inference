The statute is designed to prevent the promotion of red meat products, which have been linked to certain forms of cancer. This is a significant public health issue, and the government has a right to take measures to protect its citizens from potential harm. While the statute may affect the speech rights of producers of red meat, the government's interest in public health outweighs these rights. Therefore, the court is likely to find the statute constitutional. Answer: D. Yes, because it serves a legitimate government interest in protecting public health.",
