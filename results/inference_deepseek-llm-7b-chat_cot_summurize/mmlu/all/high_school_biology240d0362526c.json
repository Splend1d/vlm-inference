Which of the following describes the initial condition when the potato enters the water?\n\nA. The water potential of the pure water is negative.\nB. The water potential of the pure water is positive.\nC. The water potential of the potato is positive.\nD. The water potential of the potato is negative.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The water potential of the pure water is positive.\n\nWhen a piece of potato is dropped into a beaker of pure water, the water potential of the pure water becomes positive. Water potential is a measure of the ability of water molecules to move freely through a substance. When a substance has a positive water potential, it means that there is a higher concentration of water molecules in the substance than in the surrounding environment. This causes water molecules to move into the substance, creating a net flow of water into the substance.\n\nIn this case, the potato is a solid substance with a lower concentration of water molecules than the pure water. When the potato is immersed in the pure water, the water molecules from the pure water move into the potato, causing the water potential of the potato to become negative. The water potential of the pure water, however, remains positive due to the higher concentration of water molecules. Therefore, the initial condition when the potato enters the water is that the water potential of the pure water is positive.",
