Growing support for constitutional strict constructionism\n\nassistant:Albert Beveridge's speech, \"The March of the Flag,\" delivered in Indianapolis on September 16, 1898, advocates a policy of expanding the United States' territorial reach, particularly in the Pacific. In the text you provided, Beveridge argues that the United States has the ability to govern and administer new territories, regardless of their cultural differences, and that doing so is essential to the nation's growth and power. This policy foreshadowed the United States' subsequent expansion into the Pacific and its eventual rise to a great power.\n\nTherefore, the policy advocated by Beveridge foreshadowed the rise of the United States to the status of a great power.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
