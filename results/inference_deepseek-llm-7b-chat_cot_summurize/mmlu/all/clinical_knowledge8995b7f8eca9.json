These patients are more likely to have clear urine.\nD. These patients are less likely to have catheter encrustation.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. These patients are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their blood sugar is unstable.\n\nDiabetes can affect the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, which can lead to a range of complications. One of the most common complications of diabetes is urinary tract infections (UTIs). When a person with diabetes has high blood sugar levels, it can make the urine more acidic, which can irritate the lining of the bladder and urethra. This irritation can provide a breeding ground for bacteria, leading to UTIs.\n\nIn addition, high blood sugar levels can also impair the body's immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. This can make UTIs more likely to occur in people with diabetes. UTIs can cause symptoms such as frequent urination, painful urination, and pelvic pain. If left untreated, UTIs can lead to more serious complications such as kidney infections or kidney damage.\n\nIt is important for people with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar levels and take steps to prevent UTIs, such as drinking plenty of water, practicing good hygiene, and taking prescribed antibiotics if needed.",
