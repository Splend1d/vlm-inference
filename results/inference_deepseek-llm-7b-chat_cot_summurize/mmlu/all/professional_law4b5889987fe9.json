Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.\n\nThis is because Alice was the first owner of the property and her ownership was recorded. Barbara, who later acquired the property from Alice, did not record her deed, and therefore, her ownership would not be recognized in the eyes of the law. Charlene, who received the property from Barbara and recorded her deed, would also have a stronger claim to the property than Barbara.",
