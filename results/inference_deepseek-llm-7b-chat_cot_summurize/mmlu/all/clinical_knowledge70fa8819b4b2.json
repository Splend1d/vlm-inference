Option C implies that this is a specialist skill, which may not be true for every case. Option D is a time constraint, but it doesn't provide information on the conditions under which the removal should take place.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of undertaking the removal under aseptic conditions, which is crucial to prevent infection and promote proper healing. Aseptic conditions ensure that the area is free from bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause infections. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate and safest choice.",
