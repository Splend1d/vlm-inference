Statement 2 | Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: For every positive integer n, there is a cyclic group of order n. This statement is true. A cyclic group of order n is a group that can be generated by a single element, and it exists for every positive integer n. This is a fundamental concept in group theory.\n\nStatement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This statement is also true. In a finite cyclic group, every element can be written as a product of powers of a generator. Since the order of the generator divides the order of the group, there must be an element in the group with that order. Therefore, every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which leads to the answer A. True, True.",
