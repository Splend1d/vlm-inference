If the proton's initial velocity vector makes an angle of 30\u00b0 with the direction of B, compute the proton's speed 4 s after entering the magnetic field.\n\nA. 5.0 \u00d7 10^5 m/s\nB. 7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s\nC. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\nD. 3.0 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nassistant:We can use the formula for the change in velocity due to a magnetic field:\n\n\u0394v = q(v x B)t\n\nwhere \u0394v is the change in velocity, q is the charge of the proton, v is the initial velocity, B is the magnetic field, and t is the time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in velocity in the direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the initial velocity. The initial velocity is given as 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s, and the angle between the proton's initial velocity vector and the magnetic field vector is 30\u00b0.\n\nTo find the change in velocity in the perpendicular direction, we can use the sine of the angle:\n\n\u0394v_perpendicular = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * sin(30\u00b0)\n\u0394v_perpendicular = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s * 0.5\n\u0394v_perpendicular = 7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s\n\nNow we can use the formula for the change in velocity due to a magnetic field:\n\n\u0394v = q(v x B)t\n\u0394v = (1.6 \u00d7 10^(-19) C) * (7.5 \u00d7 10^5 m/s) * 4 s\n\u0394v = 2 \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 10^(-19) * 7.5 \u00d7 10^5\n\u0394v = 4.8 \u00d7 10^(-17) m/s\n\nNow we can find the total change in velocity:\n\n\u0394v_total = 1.6 \u00d7 10^6 m/s + 4.8 \u00d7 10^(-17) m/s\n\u0394v_total = 1.60048 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nNow we can find the speed of the proton 4 s after entering the magnetic field:\n\nspeed = initial_speed + change_in_velocity\nspeed = 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s + 1.60048 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\nspeed = 1.75048 \u00d7 10^6 m/s\n\nSo the speed of the proton 4 s after entering the magnetic field is approximately 1.75 \u00d7 10^6 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3.0 \u00d7 10^6 m/s",
