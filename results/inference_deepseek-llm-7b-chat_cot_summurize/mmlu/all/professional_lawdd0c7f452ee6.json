In this case, the agreement between the farmer and the retailer is aleatory because the delivery of strawberries is dependent on the outcome of an uncertain event, which is the farmer's ability to supply enough strawberries to meet the retailer's order.\n\nAn illusory contract is not the correct answer because an illusory contract is a contract that appears to exist but does not actually exist, whereas the agreement between the farmer and the retailer is a valid and enforceable contract. A best efforts contract is not the correct answer because a best efforts contract is a contract in which the party agrees to use reasonable efforts to perform the obligations under the contract, but the outcome is uncertain. A requirements contract is not the correct answer because a requirements contract is a contract in which the party agrees to supply a specific quantity or quality of goods or services, and the other party agrees to accept those goods or services.",
