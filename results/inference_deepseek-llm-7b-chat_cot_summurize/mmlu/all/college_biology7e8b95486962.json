This result shows that the song of his species is most likely\n\nA. entirely learned during development\nB. entirely instinctive\nC. both instinctive and learned\nD. dependent upon hormones for proper development\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. entirely learned during development.\n\nThis is because the young male bird was only exposed to the song of a different bird species, and as a result, developed a song repertoire that lacked certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that his song was not purely instinctive, as he did not have any innate knowledge of his own species' song. Instead, it appears that he learned his song through exposure to the different species' song. Therefore, it is most likely that his song was entirely learned during development.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Instinctive: The bird's song was not instinctive, as it lacked certain characteristics typical of his own species.\nC. Both instinctive and learned: This option is not supported by the information given in the passage.\nD. Dependent upon hormones for proper development: The passage does not mention anything about hormones affecting the bird's song development.",
