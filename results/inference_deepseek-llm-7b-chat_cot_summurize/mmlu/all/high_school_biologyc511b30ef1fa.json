Divergent evolution\nB. Convergent evolution\nC. Parallel evolution\nD. Coevolution\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Convergent evolution.\n\nConvergent evolution occurs when two or more unrelated species independently evolve similar traits or characteristics due to similar environmental pressures or ecological roles. In this case, the two unrelated species evolve in a way that makes them more similar, which is an example of convergent evolution.\n\nOption A, divergent evolution, refers to the process of two or more species evolving in different directions over time due to genetic variation and natural selection.\n\nOption C, parallel evolution, refers to the process of two or more species evolving in similar ways but not necessarily for the same reasons or in response to the same environmental pressures.\n\n Option D, coevolution, refers to the process of two or more species evolving in a way that is directly influenced by each other's existence, such as when one species evolves to exploit or defend against the other species.",
