For this individual, it must be the case that\n\nA. the marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is less than the marginal cost.\nB. the total benefit received from eating cake is falling.\nC. the ratio of marginal benefit over marginal cost is less than one.\nD. the marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is greater than the marginal cost.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of marginal benefit and marginal cost.\n\nMarginal benefit is the additional benefit an individual receives from consuming one additional unit of a good or service. Marginal cost is the additional cost incurred when producing one additional unit of a good or service.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is less than the marginal cost. This statement is true because the marginal benefit of consuming more cake decreases while the marginal cost of producing more cake remains constant.\n\nB. The total benefit received from eating cake is falling. This statement is true because as Skylar consumes more cake, the marginal benefit of each additional piece of cake decreases.\n\nC. The ratio of marginal benefit over marginal cost is less than one. This statement is true because the marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is less than the marginal cost, which means the ratio is less than one.\n\nD. The marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is greater than the marginal cost. This statement is false because the marginal benefit of the second piece of cake is less than the marginal cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The ratio of marginal benefit over marginal cost is less than one.",
