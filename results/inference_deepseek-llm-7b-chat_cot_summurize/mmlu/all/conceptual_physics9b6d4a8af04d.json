Both of these\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:A step-up transformer in an electric circuit can step up both voltage and energy. The transformer increases the voltage of an alternating current (AC) input signal by changing the amplitude of the magnetic field in the core, and it also increases the energy of the AC input signal by changing the amplitude of the current flowing through the primary winding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Both of these.",
