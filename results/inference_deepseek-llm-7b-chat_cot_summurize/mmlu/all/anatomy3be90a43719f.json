The right main bronchus is wider and more vertical, making it easier for the fragment to enter the right lung. The left main bronchus is narrower and less vertical, making it less likely for the fragment to enter the left lung. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Right lung because the right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left.",
