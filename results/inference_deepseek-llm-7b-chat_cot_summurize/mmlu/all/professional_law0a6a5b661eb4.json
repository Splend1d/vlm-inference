However, the landlord was aware of the defective ceiling and chose not to repair it before delivering possession to the tenant. The employee of the tenant was injured due to the defective ceiling, and the employee initiated a suit against the landlord to recover damages.\n\nUnder the terms of the lease, the tenant agreed to assume full responsibility for the necessary repairs, which includes the safety of the premises. Since the landlord was aware of the defective ceiling, they should have repaired it before delivering possession to the tenant. However, the landlord did not perform any repair work on the ceiling. As a result, the tenant cannot be held liable for the defective ceiling, as they assumed full responsibility for the necessary repairs.\n\nThe landlord's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to the tenant by the terms of the lease. Therefore, the correct answer is B. landowner's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to a tenant by the terms of a lease.",
