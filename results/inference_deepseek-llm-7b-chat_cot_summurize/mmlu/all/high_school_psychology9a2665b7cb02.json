This means that the researcher collected data from the participants at a specific point in time, rather than following the participants over an extended period of time (longitudinal) or grouping them based on a specific stage in their life (B. stage) or development (C. developmental). The researcher simply gathered data from a diverse group of participants at different ages and then compared their problem-solving abilities.",
