Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in Scenario 1 is not doing something clearly morally wrong. They listen to their friends and choose not to drive home when they are too drunk, which is a responsible decision. In Scenario 2, the main character is laughing hysterically during a funeral, which can be considered disrespectful and inappropriate, but it doesn't necessarily meet the definition of a clear moral wrong.\n\nSo the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.",
