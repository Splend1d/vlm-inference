Closed winding: A closed winding is necessary for the DC machine to function properly. It is used to create a closed magnetic circuit, which is necessary for the proper operation of the machine.\n\nB. Lap winding: Lap winding is used to provide insulation between the stator windings. It is necessary to prevent electrical shorts between the windings and to ensure the safety of the machine.\n\nC. Wave winding: Wave winding is used to provide the magnetic path for the current to flow through. It is necessary for the proper operation of the machine.\n\nD. Open type winding: Open type winding is not necessary for a DC machine. It is used in AC machines to provide a path for the magnetic field to flow through.\n\nSo, all of the given options are necessary for a DC machine.",
