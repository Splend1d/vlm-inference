Not independent and, therefore, may not issue a compilation report.\nD. Not independent and, therefore, may issue a compilation report, but may not issue a review report.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not independent and, therefore, may not be associated with the financial statements.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAccording to AICPA's Independence Standards, an accountant with a direct financial interest in a nonissuer is not independent if that interest is material. In this case, the accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest, so the accountant is not independent. Therefore, the accountant may not be associated with the financial statements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immaterial direct financial interest does not make the accountant independent.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the accountant can still issue a compilation report if they are not independent but have a material direct financial interest in the nonissuer.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the accountant may not issue a review report, but they can still issue a compilation report if they have a material direct financial interest in the nonissuer.",
