If the price of aluminum falls, and all other variables are held constant, we expect\n\nA. the demand for aluminum to rise.\nB. the supply of bicycles to rise.\nC. the supply of bicycles to fall.\nD. the demand for bicycles to rise.\n\nassistant:A. the demand for aluminum to rise.\n\nIf the price of aluminum falls, it becomes cheaper to produce bicycles, which means that producers can produce more bicycles with the same amount of resources. This increase in production will lead to an increase in the supply of bicycles.\n\nSince the price of aluminum is not directly related to the demand for bicycles, we cannot predict whether the demand for bicycles will rise or fall. However, if the price of aluminum falls, it may make aluminum-based products, like bicycles, more affordable for consumers, which could lead to an increase in demand for bicycles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. the demand for aluminum to rise.",
