However, I can provide some information about the topic.\n\nSchool desegregation was a major civil rights movement in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. The Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 declared that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. However, many schools in the South continued to practice racial segregation for many years after the decision.\n\nThe approval of school desegregation was not uniform throughout the United States. In the South, where racial segregation was more deeply entrenched, there was strong opposition to desegregation. In contrast, the rest of the country, particularly the North, was more supportive of desegregation.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the exact difference in approval of school desegregation from the South and the rest of the U.S. at its peak, as public opinion on the issue varied widely. However, some surveys and polls from the time suggest that the difference in approval was significant. For example, in the 1960s, a Gallup poll found that 80% of white Southerners opposed school desegregation, compared to only 40% of white Northerners who opposed it. Another survey conducted in 1965 found that only 20% of white Southerners supported school desegregation, compared to 60% of white Northerners who supported it.\n\nIn summary, the approval of school desegregation from the South and the rest of the U.S. was significantly different at its peak, with the South being more opposed to desegregation and the rest of the U.S. being more supportive. However, it is difficult to quantify the exact difference in approval at the time.",
