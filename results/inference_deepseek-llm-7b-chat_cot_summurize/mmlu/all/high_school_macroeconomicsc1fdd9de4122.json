NI will be greater than GDP.\n\nExplanation:\nIf transfer payments are greater than Social Security contributions, corporate taxes, and retained earnings combined, it means that the government is spending more on transfer payments than the sum of Social Security contributions, corporate taxes, and retained earnings. This would result in a higher level of net income (NI) for the government, as the government's spending exceeds its revenue. Since NI is greater than GDP, which is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within an economy, it follows that the net income will be greater than GDP.",
