Who is entitled to the proceeds of the crop?\n\nA. The friend's heirs.\nB. The cousin.\nC. The woman.\nD. Divided equally between the friend's heirs and the woman.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The cousin.\n\nIn the given situation, the woman executed a deed in 2001 conveying a tract of land to her friend for life, with the condition that if liquor is ever sold on the tract of land, then the property would go to her cousin and his heirs. Unfortunately, the friend died intestate before the wheat he had planted could be harvested in 2004.\n\nSince the friend died before the property was transferred to his heirs, the property remains in the hands of the woman, who originally conveyed the land to her friend for life. Since the friend's interest in the land was conditioned upon the sale of liquor, and since the friend's heirs would have inherited the property under the condition, the cousin would be the one entitled to the proceeds of the wheat crop.\n\nTherefore, the cousin is the one who is entitled to the proceeds of the crop, and the answer is B. The friend's heirs are not entitled to the proceeds of the crop, as the property had not been transferred to them. The woman is also not entitled to the proceeds, as the deed she executed to her friend for life contained the condition that the property would go to her cousin and his heirs.",
