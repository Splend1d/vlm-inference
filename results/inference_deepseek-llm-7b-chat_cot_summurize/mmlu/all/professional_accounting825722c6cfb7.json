Calculate the present value of the annual savings:\n$45,000 (savings due to reduced scrap) + $65,000 (savings due to reduced labor costs) = $1,105,000\n\n2. Calculate the present value of the salvage value:\n$120,000 (estimated final salvage value) / (1 - 0.34) ^ 4 (useful life) = $455,720\n\n3. Calculate the present value of the machine:\n$475,000 (cost of the machine) / (1 - 0.34) ^ 0 (3-year property class for MACRS depreciation purposes) = $1,178,320\n\n4. Calculate the present value of the incremental cash outflow:\n$1,105,000 (savings) + $455,720 (salvage value) - $1,178,320 (cost of machine) = $161,960\n\nSince the incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is closest to $280,000.00, the correct answer is A. $280,000.00.",
