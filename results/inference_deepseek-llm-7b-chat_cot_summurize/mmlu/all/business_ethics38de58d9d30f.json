Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted.\n\nExplanation: The question mentions three types of limitations and risks in business-CSO collaborations: power imbalance, unfair distribution of benefits, and CSOs being hoodwinked. These can all be related to informational asymmetries, where one party has more information than the other. In the context of resources, power imbalance and unfair distribution of benefits can lead to co-optation, where one party gains more from the relationship than the other.",
