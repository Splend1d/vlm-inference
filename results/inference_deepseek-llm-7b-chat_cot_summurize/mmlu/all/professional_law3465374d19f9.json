Hearsay is a statement that is offered in court as evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the pedestrian's account of the accident was obtained through hypnosis, which is not a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. The admission of the driver's license plate number does not change the fact that the testimony is still hearsay. Therefore, the hypnotist's testimony would not be admissible in court.\n\nThis question is based on the knowledge of the rules of evidence and hearsay in legal proceedings. Hearsay is a statement that is offered in court as evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the hypnotist's testimony is hearsay because the pedestrian's account of the accident was obtained through hypnosis, which is not a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.
