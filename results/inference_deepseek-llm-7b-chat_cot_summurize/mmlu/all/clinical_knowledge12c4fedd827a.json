Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones. They selectively bind to androgen receptors and activate them, which leads to muscle growth, fat loss, and improved bone density. Some popular SARMs include Ostarine, Ligandrol, and Andarine. These drugs have gained popularity in the fitness and bodybuilding communities due to their potential benefits without the severe side effects associated with anabolic steroids. However, it is important to note that SARMs are not approved for human use by the FDA and their long-term effects and safety are not well understood.",
