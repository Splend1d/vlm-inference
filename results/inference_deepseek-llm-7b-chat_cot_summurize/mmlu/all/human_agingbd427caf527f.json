Discrimination\nB. Age bias\nC. Negative impact\nD. Intention\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Age bias.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that older workers no longer need to prove age bias to win a job discrimination suit. This means that they can now win a case by showing that they were discriminated against due to their age, rather than having to prove that their employer intentionally discriminated against them based on their age.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Discrimination: This option is too general and does not specify the type of discrimination that the older worker is facing.\n\nC. Negative impact: This option is also too vague and does not specifically address the issue of age bias in the workplace.\n\nD. Intention: While this option is more specific than option A, it is still not the correct answer because it does not accurately describe the ruling. The Supreme Court did not rule that older workers no longer need to prove intentional discrimination, but rather that they no longer need to prove age bias.",
