The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The buildings' other floors were rented to professionals and used as offices. There was an enclosed walkway that connected the second floor of each building. Thus, shoppers and office staff could walk across the common walkway and gain access to each building. While the buildings were being used in this manner, the millionaire sold the dental building to an investor by warranty deed, which made no mention of any rights concerning the walkway.

As a result, the investor hired a contractor to repair the walkway area.

This is because the warranty deed, which was used to sell the dental building to the investor, made no mention of any rights concerning the walkway. Therefore, the investor likely has an easement in the walkway, which grants them the right to use and maintain it. Additionally, the investor may have an implied right to keep the walkway in repair in order to protect themselves from potential tort liability if someone is injured due to unsafe conditions.",
