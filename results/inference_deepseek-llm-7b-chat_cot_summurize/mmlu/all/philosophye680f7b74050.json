However, I can suggest that your question is related to the works of Thomas Aquinas, a 13th-century Italian Dominican philosopher and theologian.\n\nThomas Aquinas' main work, \"Summa Theologiae,\" includes his views on human actions and their ultimate end. He believed that all human actions, even seemingly wicked ones, ultimately serve the end of achieving happiness or fulfilling the inherent goods of human nature.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to your question would be:\n\nD. those who act wickedly.\n\nThomas Aquinas argued that even wicked actions serve some ultimate end, which is the pursuit of happiness or the fulfillment of inherent goods in human nature.",
