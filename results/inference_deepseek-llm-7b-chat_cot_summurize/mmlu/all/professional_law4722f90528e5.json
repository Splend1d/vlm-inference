An amendment to that act extends coverage to the states as employers. The federal district court allowed an injunction to prevent further discrimination but refused to allow money damages and legal fees against the state on the basis of 11th Amendment sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs appealed. What should the Court of Appeals decide based on the established jurisprudence regarding sovereign immunity?\n\nA. There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.\nB. There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.\nC. There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\nD. There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.\n\nassistant:The Court of Appeals should decide that there is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of citizens to petition the government for a redress of grievances. In this case, the women are seeking a remedy for the hostile work environment they have been subjected to, which is a form of discrimination. As such, their lawsuit is a petition for a redress of grievances, which is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThe 11th Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the states are immune from certain lawsuits brought by citizens of other states. However, this immunity is not absolute. The Supreme Court has recognized that states may be sued under certain circumstances, such as when they are acting as employers. In this case, the plaintiffs are suing the state government, which is acting as their employer, and are therefore seeking a remedy under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which applies to employers.\n\nUnder established jurisprudence regarding sovereign immunity, the Court of Appeals should find that there is no sovereign immunity in this case. The First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination should take precedence over the 11th Amendment immunity. The Court should therefore allow the plaintiffs to seek money damages and legal fees against the state.",
