If each piece of paper has side lengths of 1 foot, what is the total area of the bulletin board?\n\nA. 1 foot\nB. 30 feet\nC. 1 square foot\nD. 30 square feet\n\nassistant:To find the total area of the bulletin board, we first need to find the total number of square feet of paper needed to cover it. Since there are 30 pieces of paper, each with a side length of 1 foot, the area of each piece of paper is 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the 30 pieces of paper is 30 \\* 1 = 30 square feet.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option D: 30 square feet.",
