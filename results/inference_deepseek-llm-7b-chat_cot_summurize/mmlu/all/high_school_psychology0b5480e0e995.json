The first stage of development occurs during the early childhood years, and the second stage occurs during the young adult years.\n\nDuring the young adult stage, individuals face the challenge of establishing a stable sense of identity and determining their place in society. This involves exploring various roles and identities, such as work, relationships, and personal interests. If successful, individuals develop a clear sense of self and are able to take on various roles with confidence and ease. However, if this stage is not resolved successfully, individuals may experience feelings of confusion and uncertainty about their identity and place in the world.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. identity vs. role confusion.",
