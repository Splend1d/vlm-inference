Scenario 1 | I threw a shovelful of dirt into the house. Scenario 2 | I cleaned the stain on my child's shirt with bleach.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in the first scenario (I threw a shovelful of dirt into the house) is doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action can be considered as vandalism or destruction of property, which is generally considered to be morally wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario (I cleaned the stain on my child's shirt with bleach), the action is not clearly morally wrong. Cleaning a stain on a shirt with bleach is a common and acceptable practice, especially if the shirt was stained with something that can be removed by bleach. In this case, the main character is not doing something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong",
