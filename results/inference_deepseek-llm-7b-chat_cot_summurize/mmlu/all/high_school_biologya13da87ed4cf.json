The offspring produced in subsequent generations have a higher percentage of birds with large beaks.\n\nThe Galapagos Islands are known for their unique and diverse wildlife, including many species of birds. During drought years, when small, easily eaten seeds become scarce, the birds with larger beaks are better able to eat the hard-cased seeds that are left. This allows them to survive while the smaller-beaked birds may not be able to find enough food to stay alive. Over time, the larger-beaked birds pass on their genes to their offspring, who also have larger beaks and are better able to survive in drought conditions. This is an example of natural selection, as the birds with the best adapted traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to the next generation. The other answers are incorrect because they either involve unnatural or unlikely processes, or they do not directly relate to the concept of natural selection.",
