According to John Rawls, the term \"justice as fairness\" conveys the idea that the principles of justice are agreed to in an initial position that is rational. Rawls proposed that people would choose a just society if they were to make their decision in a \"original position\" where they would be ignorant of their social class and other characteristics, but would be aware of their preferences and moral principles. This hypothetical position ensures that the principles of justice are chosen based on reason and fairness, rather than on self-interest or prejudice. The other options are not accurate descriptions of the initial position Rawls proposed:\n\nB. artificial - Rawls' initial position is not artificial, but rather a hypothetical scenario that aims to promote fairness and justice.\nC. constitutional - While Rawls' principles of justice can be used to construct a constitution, the initial position itself is not a constitutional concept.\nD. fair - While the initial position is intended to be fair, the term \"fairness as fairness\" does not accurately capture the essence of Rawls' concept.",
