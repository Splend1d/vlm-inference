Skytop evaluates capital projects using discounted cash flows at a cost of capital of 10% per year. Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason:\n\nA. Yes Net cash flow is $20000\nB. Yes Net future value is $36025\nC. No Net present value is ($750)\nD. No Net present value is ($8750)\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided and perform the necessary calculations.\n\n1. Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10%: $1.464\n2. Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10%: $0.683\n3. Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10%: $4.641\n4. Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10%: $3.170\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cash inflows from the machine.\nCash inflows = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the discount factors for 4 years at a 10% cost of capital.\nDiscount factor = $1 * e^(0.1*4) = $1 * e^(0.4) = $1 * 2.6255 = $2.6255\n\nNow we can calculate the net cash flow and net future value.\nNet cash flow = Cash inflows - Cost of machine = $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000\nNet future value = Future value of cash inflows - Cost of machine = $46,410 - $80,000 = $33,590\n\nNext, we need to calculate the net present value.\nNet present value = Net cash flow * (Discount factor / (1 + Discount factor))\nNet present value = $20,000 * ($2.6255 / (1 + 2.6255)) = $20,000 * 0.6255 = $12,510\n\nNow, let's compare the results to the given options.\nA. Yes Net cash flow is $20,000 - The net cash flow is $20,000, which matches the correct answer.\nB. Yes Net future value is $33,590 - The net future value is $33,590, which matches the correct answer.\nC. No Net present value is ($750) - The net present value is $12,510, which does not match the correct answer.\nD. No Net present value is ($8750) - The net present value is $12,510, which does not match the correct answer.\n\nBased on the calculations, Skytop should acquire the machine, as the net cash flow is positive ($20,000), the net future value is positive ($33,590), and the net present value is positive ($12,510).",
