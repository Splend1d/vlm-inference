This is because the law places an unfair burden on new political entrants, such as the resident in this case, by requiring them to obtain five times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. This disproportionate burden likely violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the government from denying equal protection to different classes of people.",
