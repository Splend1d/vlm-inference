This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende.

The federal law prohibits the state from imposing a tax on pitchblende, and since Congress has the plenary power over interstate commerce, this federal law prevails over any inconsistent state action. Therefore, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is invalid.\n\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n\nThis answer is incorrect. While Congress may use its general welfare power to prevent state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole, this does not apply in this case. The federal law is specifically addressing the taxing power of the state, not the state legislation that Congress deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\n\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\n\nThis answer is incorrect. While it is true that Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state, in this case, the federal law is specifically addressing the taxing power of the state in relation to pitchblende. Therefore, the federal law does have the authority to interfere with the state's taxing policy in this specific instance.\n\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n\nThis answer is incorrect. While it is true that Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states, this does not apply in this case. The federal law is not placing one state on an unequal footing with other states, but rather it is limiting the taxing power of the state in relation to pitchblende.",
