You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: 0.0025 mol of a weak, monoprotic acid is dissolved in 0.250 L of distilled water. The pH was then measured as 4.26. What is the pKa of this weak acid?\n\nA. 4.26\nB. 8.52\nC. 7.92\nD. 6.52\n\nassistant:To find the pKa of the weak acid, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npKa = -log10[A-] / [H3O+]\n\nwhere [A-] is the concentration of the acid in its conjugate base form, [H3O+] is the concentration of hydronium ions, and pKa is the acid dissociation constant.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total concentration of the acid in the solution. The molarity of the acid is given as 0.0025 mol/L, and the total volume is 0.250 L:\n\ntotal concentration = [HCl] + [HCl^-] = 0.0025 mol/L + (0.0025 mol/L)(1 - x)\n\nwhere x is the fraction of the acid molecules ionized.\n\nWe can write the equation for the pH:\n\npH = -log10([H3O+]) = -1 * log10(x) = -log10(x)\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npKa = -log10([A^-]) / [H3O+]\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 1 - 10^(pKa * -1)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given pH value (4.26) and solve for pKa:\n\nx = 1 - 10^(4.26 * -1)\nx = 1 - 10^(-4.26)\nx \u2248 0.8333\n\nNow we can find the pKa:\n\npKa = -log10(0.8333)\npKa \u2248 2.76\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 7.92.",
