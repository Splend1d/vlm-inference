PO43-\n\nassistant:The conjugate acid of a negatively charged ion is the positively charged ion that has the same number of electrons as the negatively charged ion but with a positive charge. In the case of the H2PO4- ion, the conjugate acid is H3PO4, which is a positively charged phosphate ion. Therefore, the answer is C. H3PO4.",
