Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.\nB. No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.\nC. Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\nD.

Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\n\nThe mall is considered a public forum because it is open to the public, and the protesters were exercising their First Amendment right to free speech by peacefully expressing their opinion about the sale of animal fur products in the store. Therefore, the mall cannot restrict their speech without violating the First Amendment.\n\nA and B are incorrect because the mall is considered a public forum, and its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\n\nD is incorrect because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was not broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store. The mall's restriction was necessary to ensure that the protesters did not interfere with the normal operations of the store.",
