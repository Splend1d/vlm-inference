Music\nB. Theology\nC. Mathematics\nD. Law\n\nassistant:Islamic civilization had a significant impact on various fields during the time of the Crusades, including music, theology, mathematics, and law. However, the field in which it had the most influence on Europeans was law. Islamic law, also known as Sharia, provided a framework for legal systems in many European countries during the medieval period. This influence is evident in the development of legal institutions, legal codes, and the concept of the rule of law in Europe. Additionally, Islamic scholars and jurists played a crucial role in spreading knowledge about Islamic law and legal principles throughout Europe.",
