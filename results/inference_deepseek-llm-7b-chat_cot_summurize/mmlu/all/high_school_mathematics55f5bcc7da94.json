What is the probability that $x < y$?\n\nA. \\frac{1}{12}\nB. \\frac{1}{6}\nC. \\frac{2}{3}\nD. \\frac{1}{3}\n\nassistant:We can find the area of the region where $x < y$, and divide it by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nThe total area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\nThe points $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x < y$ are the points that lie below the line $y = x$.\n\nWe can find the $x$-intercepts of this line by setting $y = x$ and solving for $x$. This gives us $x = 0$ and $x = 2$.\n\nThe $y$-intercept of this line is $(0,1)$.\n\nThe points $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x < y$ are the points in the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(2,1)$.\n\nThe area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $x < y$ is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. $\\frac{1}{12}$.",
