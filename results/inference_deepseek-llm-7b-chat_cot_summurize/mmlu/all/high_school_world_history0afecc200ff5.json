The song is set in the context of a \"poor Winter King\" who has committed a wrong by snatching the Kaiser's crown. The mention of Ferdinand as a lawful king and the reference to Rhine and Prague suggest a connection to European countries, which are historically associated with Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The Roman Catholic and Muslim options do not have a clear connection to the context of the poem, while the Protestant option is not as strongly linked to the historical context.",
