Infections: Both men and women can experience pain during sexual intercourse due to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. These infections can cause inflammation, irritation, and pain in the genital area.\n\nB. Foreskin too tight: In men, if the foreskin (prepuce) is too tight, it can be difficult to retract it completely, which can cause pain during sexual intercourse. This is known as phimosis.\n\nC. Vaginismus: Vaginismus is a condition where a woman experiences involuntary muscle contractions in her vaginal muscles, making sexual penetration painful or impossible.\n\nD. Both A and C: It is possible that both an infection and vaginismus could cause coital pain for both men and women.\n\nIt is important to note that the presence of pain during sexual intercourse can be a sign of an underlying health issue, and it is recommended to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment if necessary.",
