Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.\n\nA court would likely enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances. The contract explicitly prohibits the assignment of the contract or any of its terms, and the distributor has agreed to these terms by signing the contract. As a result, the distributor's right to receive the funds would be considered part of the contract, and the bar against assignment would apply.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this answer assumes that the contract was signed voluntarily and without coercion. If the distributor was coerced into signing the contract, or if the bar against assignment was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process, the court may not enforce the bar against assignment.",
