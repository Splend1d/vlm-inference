During the month of April 10000 units were started and 9000 completed units were transferred. The ending work-in-process inventory was complete as to materials and 50% complete as to conversion. The cost of direct materials was $114000 and the cost of direct labor amounted to $38000. Manufacturing overhead is assigned at the rate of 50% of direct materials. For the purpose of determining the cost of goods manufactured in April what is the cost per equivalent whole unit?\n\nA. $23.22\nB. $21.40\nC. $20.90\nD. 15.4\n\nassistant:To calculate the cost per equivalent whole unit, we need to determine the number of units completed, which can be found by subtracting the work in process inventory from the units started. Then, we can calculate the cost of goods manufactured by adding the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead to the units completed. Finally, we can divide the total cost by the number of units completed to find the cost per equivalent whole unit.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\nUnits started: 10,000\nUnits completed: 9,000\nWork in process inventory complete as to materials: 0\nWork in process inventory complete as to conversion: 50%\nCost of direct materials: $114,000\nCost of direct labor: $38,000\nManufacturing overhead rate: 50% of direct materials\n\nFirst, let's find the units completed:\nUnits completed = Units started - Work in process inventory\nUnits completed = 10,000 - 0 = 10,000\n\nNext, let's find the cost of goods manufactured by adding the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead to the units completed:\nCost of goods manufactured = Units completed * (Cost of direct materials + Cost of direct labor + Manufacturing overhead)\nCost of goods manufactured = 10,000 * (114,000 + 38,000 + 0.5 * 114,000)\nCost of goods manufactured = 10,000 * (114,000 + 38,000 + 57,000)\nCost of goods manufactured = 10,000 * 199,000\nCost of goods manufactured = $1,990,000\n\nFinally, let's find the cost per equivalent whole unit by dividing the cost of goods manufactured by the number of units completed:\nCost per equivalent whole unit = Cost of goods manufactured / Units completed\nCost per equivalent whole unit = $1,990,000 / 10,000\nCost per equivalent whole unit = $199\n\nSince the closest option is $199, the correct answer is D. 15.4.",
