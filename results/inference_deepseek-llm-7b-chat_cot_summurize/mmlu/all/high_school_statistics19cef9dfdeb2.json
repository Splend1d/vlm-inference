Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.\nD. Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.\n\nassistant:The better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school is Plan II. Plan II uses a random sample of 30 students from the 132 who have investments in the market, which is more representative of the entire student population. This plan provides a confidence interval estimate of the average investment of students with investments, and then multiplies both ends of the interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Since Plan II uses a more representative sample, it is more likely to provide a more accurate estimate of the total stock market investment by students in this school.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Plan II.",
