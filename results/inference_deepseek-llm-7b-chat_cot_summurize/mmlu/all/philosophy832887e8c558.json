He argued that the ultimate good is God's love, and that the ultimate perfection of operation is to be in a state of loving union with God.\n\nPleasure, delight, and peace are all good things, but they are not considered to be the ultimate perfection of operation according to Aquinas's philosophy. Instead, he believed that the ultimate goal of human existence is to achieve a state of union with God, which he believed is achieved through love and devotion.",
