For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.841\n\nassistant:Let's calculate the probabilities for each company's fuse lasting at least 1 hour using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the fuse time, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nCompany I:\nz = (50 - 50) / 10 = 0\n\nCompany II:\nz = (55 - 50) / 5 = 1.2\n\nNow, let's find the probabilities for each company:\n\nFor Company I:\nP(X \u2265 60) = 1 - P(X < 60)\nP(X < 60) = 1 - P(X \u2264 50)\nP(X \u2264 50) = 0.6827 (from the z-table)\nP(X \u2265 60) = 1 - 0.6827 = 0.3173\n\nFor Company II:\nP(X \u2265 60) = 1 - P(X < 60)\nP(X < 60) = 1 - P(X \u2264 55)\nP(X \u2264 55) = 0.9846 (from the z-table)\nP(X \u2265 60) = 1 - 0.9846 = 0.0154\n\nNow, let's compare the probabilities:\n\nP(Company I's fuse lasts at least 1 hour) = 0.3173\nP(Company II's fuse lasts at least 1 hour) = 0.0154\n\nSince the probability for Company II's fuse lasting at least 1 hour is greater than the probability for Company I's fuse, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Company II's, because of its greater mean",
