The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from establishing a national religion or favoring one religion over another. The fact that the president of the senior class initiated the practice on his own initiative does not change the fact that it is being done on behalf of the school and could be seen as an endorsement by the school. Therefore, it would be considered a violation of the establishment clause.\n\nB. is incorrect because the primary effect of the invocation is not to advance religious beliefs, but rather to endorse religion in the school setting.\nC. is incorrect because the lunch hour is part of the educational process, and the invocation is taking place during this time.\nD. is incorrect because the noncompulsory nature of the invocation does not make it any less of a violation of the establishment clause.",
