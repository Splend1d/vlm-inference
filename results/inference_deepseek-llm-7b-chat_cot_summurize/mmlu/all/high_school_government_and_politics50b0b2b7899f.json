The due process clause in the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees certain fundamental rights to individuals, including protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as the right to due process in legal proceedings. This has allowed the Supreme Court to extend protections from the Bill of Rights to state law, as long as these protections are consistent with the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe other options are not the main focus of the Fourteenth Amendment.
