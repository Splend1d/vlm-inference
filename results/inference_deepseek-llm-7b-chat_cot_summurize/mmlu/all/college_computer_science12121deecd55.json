II only\nC. III only\nD. I and II\n\nassistant:A Euler circuit is a circuit (a path without any edges between the first and last vertex) in which each edge of the graph appears exactly once.\n\nAn undirected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.\n\nI. A complete graph with 12 vertices has 12 * (12 - 1) / 2 = 60 edges. Since each vertex has a degree of 12, each vertex has an even degree. Therefore, this graph does not have an Euler circuit.\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices has 13 * (13 - 1) / 2 = 65 edges. Since each vertex has a degree of 13, each vertex has an odd degree. Therefore, this graph does not have an Euler circuit.\n\nIII. A tree with 13 vertices has 13 - 1 = 12 edges. If the tree is not complete, it must have at least one vertex with an odd degree. Therefore, the tree must be complete in order to have an Euler circuit. In this case, the tree has exactly 0 vertices with odd degrees, and therefore has an Euler circuit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. III only.",
