Cortex\nB. Palisade mesophyll\nC. Epidermis\nD. Vascular cambium\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Palisade mesophyll.\n\nIn actively photosynthesizing plants, the palisade mesophyll, which is the innermost layer of the mesophyll, is responsible for the highest rate of oxygen production. This is because the palisade mesophyll contains large, flat, and thin-walled chloroplasts, which are essential for the process of photosynthesis. The other options, such as the cortex, epidermis, and vascular cambium, do not play a significant role in the process of photosynthesis and oxygen production.",
