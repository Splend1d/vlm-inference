Total debt to total assets Working capital\n\nA. Increase Increase\nB. Increase Decrease\nC. Decrease Increase\nD. Decrease Decrease\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, we need to consider how issuing additional capital stock for cash affects each ratio or measure.\n\n1. Total debt to total assets:\nThis ratio compares the total debt of a company to its total assets. When the company issues additional capital stock for cash, it increases its equity, which reduces the proportion of debt to total assets. Therefore, the ratio would decrease.\n\n2. Working capital:\nWorking capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. When the company issues additional capital stock for cash, it increases its cash and reduces its liabilities. Therefore, the working capital would increase.\n\nBased on these calculations, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Decrease Decrease (for Total debt to total assets)\nC. Increase (for Working capital)",
