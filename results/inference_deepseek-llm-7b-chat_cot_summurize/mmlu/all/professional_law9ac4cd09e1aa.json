As a result, a car that was next to the truck was forced off the highway and crashed into a concrete barrier along the roadway. The driver of the car suffered a broken leg. An ambulance arrived and rushed her to the hospital. A doctor there examined the broken leg and ordered X-rays to be taken. The doctor carelessly misread the X-rays and set the broken bone improperly. As a result of the doctor's negligence, the driver's leg never healed completely, and the driver was left with a significant impairment of the use of her leg.

The truck driver will be liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiff when her car crashed, but not the additional or enhanced harm resulting from the doctor's careless mistake.\n\nThis is because the truck driver's negligence was the direct cause of the car crashing into the concrete barrier, leading to the broken leg and subsequent injuries. However, the doctor's negligence in misreading the X-rays and setting the broken bone improperly was not foreseeable by the truck driver and was an independent tort committed by the doctor. Therefore, the truck driver would not be liable for the additional or enhanced harm resulting from the doctor's negligence.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a simplified explanation of the legal situation and the actual outcome may depend on various factors such as the jurisdiction, the specific circumstances of the case, and the evidence presented.",
