Incorporation costs: Incorporation costs refer to the expenses incurred during the formation of a corporation. These costs may include legal fees, filing fees, and other expenses related to creating the corporation. These costs can generally be amortized for tax purposes.\n\nB. Temporary directors\u2019 fees: Temporary directors\u2019 fees refer to the fees paid to directors who serve on a company's board for a short period of time. These fees can be considered a non-deductible expense, as they are not directly related to the production of income. Therefore, these fees cannot be amortized for tax purposes.\n\nC. Stock issuance costs: Stock issuance costs refer to the expenses associated with issuing new shares of stock, such as underwriting fees, legal fees, and other expenses related to the issuance process. These costs can generally be amortized for tax purposes.\n\nD. Organizational meeting costs: Organizational meeting costs refer to the expenses incurred during the first meeting of a newly formed corporation's board of directors. These costs may include venue rental, catering, and other expenses related to the meeting. These costs can generally be amortized for tax purposes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the term that cannot be amortized for tax purposes is temporary directors\u2019 fees.",
