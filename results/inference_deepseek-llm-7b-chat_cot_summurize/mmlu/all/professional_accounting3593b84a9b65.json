Requested that management justify the use of the other comprehensive basis of accounting in the management representation letter.\n\nassistant:The accountant would most likely have taken action B, which is to advise management to make the adjustments necessary for the account balances to conform with GAAP. This is because the accountant reviewed the financial statements in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services, and it is likely that GAAP was not being followed. Therefore, the accountant would have advised management to make the necessary adjustments to conform to GAAP.\n\nAction A, withdrawing from the engagement, is not likely because the accountant did not have to withdraw based on the information provided. Action C, modifying the review report, is not necessary either, as the accountant did not change the basis of accounting used to prepare the financial statements. Action D, requesting management to justify the use of the other comprehensive basis of accounting, is also not necessary because the accountant did not have to request this information.",
