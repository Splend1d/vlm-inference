The CPI (Consumer Price Index) increases by 2 percent.\n2. Your nominal income increases by 8 percent.\n\nTo calculate the real income, we need to adjust for inflation using the concept of nominal and real income.\n\nNominal income is the income you receive before adjusting for inflation. Real income is the income you receive after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It is used to adjust nominal income for inflation.\n\nIf the CPI increases by 2 percent, it means that the prices of goods and services have increased by 2 percent. This means that the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services.\n\nNow, let's assume your nominal income increases by 8 percent. This means that your income increases by 8 percent regardless of any changes in the prices of goods and services.\n\nTo calculate your real income, we need to adjust your nominal income for the CPI increase. We can do this by subtracting the CPI increase from your nominal income increase:\n\n8 percent (nominal income increase) - 2 percent (CPI increase) = 6 percent (real income increase)\n\nSo, your real income has increased by 6 percent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. increased by 6 percent.",
