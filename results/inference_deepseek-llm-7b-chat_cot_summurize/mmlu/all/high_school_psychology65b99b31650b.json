Apes have been able to use the words they know to express novel concepts.\n\nThis option is the strongest piece of evidence for the idea that animals are capable of developing and using a sophisticated language. Apes, such as chimpanzees and orangutans, have been observed using words and gestures to communicate about objects and events that they have not encountered before. This ability to use language to convey new information is a hallmark of human language use and suggests that apes possess a sophisticated language system.",
