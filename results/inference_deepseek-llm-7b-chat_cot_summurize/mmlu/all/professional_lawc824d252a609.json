As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving \"at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. \"The complaint is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nC. admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.\n\nassistant:The answer is B. admissible as a declaration against interest.\n\nExplanation: The roommate's testimony against the rider is admissible as a declaration against interest because it is a statement made by the roommate with a strong motive to lie in the other party's favor (the rider). The roommate has a direct financial interest in the outcome of the case, as he has already reached an out-of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. Therefore, the roommate's testimony, which contradicts the rider's version of events, can be considered as a declaration against interest.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Admissible as an admission: This is not correct because the roommate's testimony is not an admission by the graduate.\n\nC. Admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule: This is not correct because the former testimony exception only applies when a witness is unavailable to testify, and the roommate is still alive and able to testify.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise: This is not correct because the admission of the roommate's testimony is not dependent on the outcome of the lawsuit.",
