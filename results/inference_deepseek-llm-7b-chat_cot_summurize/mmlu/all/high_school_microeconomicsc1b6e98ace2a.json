Perfectly horizontal demand curve.\nB. Highly inelastic demand curve.\nC. Highly elastic demand curve.\nD. A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments.\n\nassistant:A. Perfectly horizontal demand curve.\n\nWhen rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, it means that the firms are reacting to the price change by increasing their output, which leads to an increase in market supply. In an oligopoly, where a few firms dominate the market, the firms have limited ability to influence the market price by themselves. As a result, the price decrease leads to an increase in the quantity demanded, creating a perfectly horizontal demand curve.",
