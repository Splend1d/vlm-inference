This similarity best supports which of the following hypotheses?\n\nA. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells share a common ancestor.\nB. Mitochondria are derived from ancient aerobic bacteria, and chloroplasts are derived from ancient photosynthetic bacteria.\nC. The similarity of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is an example of convergent evolution.\nD. Mitochondria and chloroplasts escaped from eukaryotic cells and formed aerobic and photosynthetic prokaryotes.\n\nassistant:The structure of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is nearly identical. This similarity can be best explained by the concept of convergent evolution. Convergent evolution occurs when two or more unrelated organisms independently evolve similar traits due to their shared environment or ecological niche. In this case, it suggests that ATP synthase evolved independently in bacteria and eukaryotic cells, leading to a nearly identical structure in both.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The similarity of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is an example of convergent evolution. \n\nA. This hypothesis suggests a common ancestor for eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, but the similarity of ATP synthase structure does not provide evidence for this.\nB. This hypothesis suggests a specific origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, but the similarity of ATP synthase does not provide enough information to support this.\nD. This hypothesis suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts escaped from eukaryotic cells and formed prokaryotic cells, but the similarity of ATP synthase does not provide evidence for this.",
