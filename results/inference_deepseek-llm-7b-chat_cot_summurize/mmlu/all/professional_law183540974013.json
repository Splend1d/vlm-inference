State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.\nD. There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.\n\nassistant:The strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation is that there is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously. This argument emphasizes the importance of the postal service for the efficient delivery of official governmental mailings within the state, and how the proposed legislation can help achieve this goal.\n\nThe other options do not provide as strong a support for the legislation. A Tenth Amendment argument is about the state's authority to regulate transactions, but it does not directly address the need for a postal service or its potential impact on the U.S. Postal Service. The validity under the supremacy clause argument is about the consistency of the bill with federal law, but it does not address the state's interest in expediting governmental mailings. The intergovernmental immunity argument may provide a reason for state employees to use the postal service at no charge, but it does not directly support the need for the proposed legislation.",
