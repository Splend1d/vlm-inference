Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface\nC. Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms\nD. Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms\n\nassistant:The patient's inability of neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to Staphylococcus aureus suggests a defect in their ability to kill intracellular microorganisms. This could be due to a deficiency in a specific enzyme or protein involved in the oxidative burst, or a general dysfunction of the immune system. This would increase the patient's susceptibility to infection and make it harder for their body to fight off bacterial infections.\n\nOption A, B, and C do not directly relate to the patient's inability to kill intracellular microorganisms.",
