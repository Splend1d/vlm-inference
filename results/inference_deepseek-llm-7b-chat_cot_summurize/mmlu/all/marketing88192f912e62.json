Broadcast media.\n\nBroadcast media, such as television and radio, can help advertisers demonstrate the benefits of using a particular product by showcasing the product in action and highlighting its features and benefits. These mediums can bring life and energy to an advertiser's message by using visually appealing graphics, music, and sound effects to capture the audience's attention and make the advertisement more engaging. In contrast, print media, such as newspapers and magazines, are more static and less interactive, making them less effective at demonstrating the benefits of a product.",
