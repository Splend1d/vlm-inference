Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\n\nassistant:D. Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\n\nThis is because in a collision between a positron and an electron, they would cancel each other out, resulting in the release of energy in the form of gamma radiation or a pair of neutrinos. The conservation of energy principle states that the total energy of the system remains constant before and after the reaction. In this case, the energy of the positron and electron before the collision is equal to the energy of the gamma radiation or neutrinos produced after the collision.",
