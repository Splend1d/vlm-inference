STM sensory registries\n\nassistant:A. visual sensory registries\n\nIconic memory refers to the temporary memory storage of visual images in the brain, which is a type of sensory registry. It is a short-term memory system that allows us to briefly store and recall visual information, such as the image of an object or scene that we briefly look at. It is distinct from other types of sensory registries, such as olfactory (smell) or auditory (sound) sensory registries. The iconic memory system plays an important role in our visual perception and cognition, and is involved in various cognitive processes such as visual attention, object recognition, and scene perception.",
