Appeal to higher loyalties: In this strategy, actors justify their unethical behavior by claiming that it is in the interest of a higher good or cause. They may argue that their actions are necessary for the greater good and that the ends justify the means.\n2. Metaphor of the ledger: In this strategy, actors compare their actions to a ledger or balance sheet, where they argue that their positive actions outweigh their negative ones. They may claim that their actions have been outweighed by their contributions to society or that the balance sheet will be in their favor in the long run.\n3.

They may argue that their actions are necessary for their own survival or well-being, or that they are taking appropriate precautions to prevent harm.",
