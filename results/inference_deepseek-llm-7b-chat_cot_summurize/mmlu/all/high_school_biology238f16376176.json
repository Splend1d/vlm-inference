This is because intrasexual selection occurs when members of the same sex compete for access to resources or mates. This competition can lead to the development of different physical characteristics, such as differences in size or coloration, that are used for display or recognition. Sexual dimorphism is the variation in size, shape, or other physical traits between males and females of the same species.",
