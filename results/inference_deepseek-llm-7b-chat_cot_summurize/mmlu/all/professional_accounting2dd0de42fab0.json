The legal life of the copyright is equivalent to the life of the author plus 50 years. Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. What amount should Corbet report as amortization expense related to the copyright at the end of the current year?\n\nA. $0\nB. $400\nC. $500\nD. 4000\n\nassistant:To determine the amount that Corbet Co. should report as amortization expense related to the copyright at the end of the current year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the life of the copyright based on the life of the author plus 50 years.\n2. Determine the number of years that Corbet Co. expects to sell the book.\n3. Divide the total purchase cost of the copyright by the number of years in Step 2 to find the annual amortization expense.\n4. Calculate the amortization expense related to the copyright at the end of the current year by multiplying the annual amortization expense by the number of years (5).\n\nStep 1: Determine the life of the copyright based on the life of the author plus 50 years.\nThe legal life of the copyright is equivalent to the life of the author plus 50 years. However, we do not know the age of the author.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of years that Corbet Co. expects to sell the book.\nCorbet Co. expects to sell the book for five years.\n\nStep 3: Divide the total purchase cost of the copyright by the number of years in Step 2 to find the annual amortization expense.\nTotal purchase cost of the copyright: $20000\nNumber of years expected to sell the book: 5\nAnnual amortization expense = Total purchase cost of the copyright / Number of years expected to sell the book\nAnnual amortization expense = $20000 / 5 = $4000\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amortization expense related to the copyright at the end of the current year by multiplying the annual amortization expense by the number of years (5).\nAmortization expense at the end of the current year = Annual amortization expense \u00d7 Number of years\nAmortization expense at the end of the current year = $4000 \u00d7 5 = $20000\n\nThe correct answer is D. 4000.",
