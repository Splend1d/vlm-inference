False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}.\n\nThis statement is true. A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel of the homomorphism is the trivial subgroup {0}. In other words, the homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is the trivial subgroup.\n\nStatement 2: Q is an ideal in R.\n\nThis statement is false. The given information does not provide enough information to determine whether Q is an ideal in R. An ideal in a ring is a subgroup that is closed under the ring's multiplication operation, but it is not necessarily closed under the ring's addition operation. Without more information, we cannot determine whether Q is an ideal in R.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
