The boyfriend initially refused to go along with the woman's plan, but ultimately agreed when threatened with the end of their relationship. This suggests that he did not intend for the husband to die, but rather only for the husband to suffer serious bodily harm, which would classify as second-degree murder. Additionally, the boyfriend was not actively participating in the act of poisoning, as he only provided the strychnine and did not sprinkle it into the guacamole himself. This further supports the classification of the crime as second-degree murder.",
