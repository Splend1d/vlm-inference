Can not exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. An irrevocable written offer to sell goods is nonassignable. This means that the merchant cannot change their mind about the offer or cancel it, and the offeree (the person receiving the offer) cannot transfer or assign the offer to someone else.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the merchant's written offer does not necessarily need to be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no specific time frame mentioned for when the written offer is valid.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the written offer can exceed a three-month duration if the merchant and offeree agree on the duration of the offer.",
