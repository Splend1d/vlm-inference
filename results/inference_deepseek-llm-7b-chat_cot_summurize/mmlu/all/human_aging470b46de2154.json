Determined genetically.\n\nTelomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that help prevent chromosomes from fusing during cell division. They naturally shorten with each cell division, and their length can vary among individuals. However, the initial length of telomeres is determined by genetics, meaning it is not influenced by factors such as climate, time of birth, parent diet and exercise.",
