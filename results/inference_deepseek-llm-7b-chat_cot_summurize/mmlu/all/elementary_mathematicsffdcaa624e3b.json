Each bucket has t tennis balls in it. There are a total of 56 tennis balls in the buckets.

We know that there are 8 buckets in total.\n2. We know that there are a total of 56 tennis balls in the buckets.\n\nNow, let's consider the different options:\n\nA. 8 \ufffd t = 56\nB. 8 \u00d7 t = 56\nC. t + 8 = 56\nD. t \ufffd 8 = 56\n\nOption A: The total number of tennis balls in the buckets is 56. If each bucket has t tennis balls, then the total number of tennis balls in all buckets is 8 \\* t. So, 8 \\* t = 56. To find the value of t, we can divide 56 by 8: 56 \ufffd 8 = 7. Therefore, option A is the correct answer: 8 \ufffd t = 56.\n\nThe answer is A.",
