No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\n\nThe automatic reverter in this case is unenforceable because it is an unreasonable restraint on alienation. The provision requires the property to revert back to the grantors, their heirs, and assigns if the property is mortgaged or encumbered within the lifetime of either grantor. This provision is overly broad and restricts the niece's ability to mortgage or encumber the property, which is an unreasonable restraint on alienation. Therefore, the surviving wife cannot enforce the automatic reverter and put title back in herself.",
