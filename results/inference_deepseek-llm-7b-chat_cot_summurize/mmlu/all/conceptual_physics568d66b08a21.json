The height of mercury in the narrower tube is\n\nA. half\nB. twice\nC. the same\nD. None of these\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to use the Venturi effect, which states that the pressure of a fluid flowing through a constriction will decrease, causing the fluid to rise. In this case, the constriction is the cross-sectional area of the mercury barometers.\n\nLet's denote the height of mercury in the narrower tube as h1, and the height of mercury in the wider tube as h2.\n\nAccording to the Venturi effect, we can write the following equation:\n\n(2 * pi * r1 * h1) / (2 * pi * r2 * h2) = 1 / 2\n\nwhere r1 and r2 are the radii of the narrower and wider tubes, respectively.\n\nSince the cross-sectional area of the narrower tube is 1 cm2 and the wider tube is 2 cm2, we can assume that the radii of the tubes are equal. Therefore, r1 = r2 = 1 cm.\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation, we get:\n\n(2 * pi * 1 cm * h1) / (2 * pi * 2 cm * h2) = 1 / 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh1 = 0.5 * h2\n\nSo, the height of mercury in the narrower tube is half the height of mercury in the wider tube. Therefore, the answer is A.",
