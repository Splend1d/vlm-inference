This is because kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to a substrate protein, resulting in the addition of a phosphate group to the substrate protein. This process is essential for regulating various cellular processes such as cell growth, division, and metabolism.",
