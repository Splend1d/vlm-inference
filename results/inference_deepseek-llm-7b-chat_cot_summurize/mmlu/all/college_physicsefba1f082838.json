As\nB. P\nC. Sb\nD. B\n\nassistant:Based on the given options, the correct answer is C. Sb.\n\nIn germanium, the most common dopants are As (antimony) and P (phosphorus), which are used to create n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively. However, the given options do not include phosphorus, so we can eliminate A and B as potential dopants.\n\nThe correct answer is C, Sb (selenium), as it cannot be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor. Selenium is a common dopant in silicon to create p-type semiconductors, but it does not have a similar effect on germanium.",
