These plants make their own proteins.\nB. These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\nC. These plants are capable of directly converting nitrogen gas into nitrates.\nD. These plants do not require nitrogen to make plant proteins.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Legumes such as beans and peas have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, called rhizobia, which live in their root nodules. These bacteria convert nitrogen gas in the air into a form that the legume can use, allowing the legume to grow well in nitrogen-poor soils.\n\nOption A is incorrect because legumes do not make their own proteins; they rely on nitrogen to do so. Option C is incorrect because legumes do require nitrogen to make plant proteins, and they do not have the ability to directly convert nitrogen gas into nitrates. Option D is incorrect because while some legumes do not require nitrogen to make plant proteins, the ability of legumes to grow well in nitrogen-poor soils is best accounted for by their relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.",
