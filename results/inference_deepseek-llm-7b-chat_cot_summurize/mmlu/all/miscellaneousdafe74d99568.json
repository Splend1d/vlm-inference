Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000\nB. Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\nC. Salary expense is decreased by $300,000; cash is increased by $300,000\nD. Salary expense is decreased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Salary expense is decreased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000.\n\nWhen Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries, the cash balance in the company's balance sheet will decrease by $300,000. This is because the cash balance is reduced by the amount of salaries paid out. At the same time, the salary expense on the income statement is also reduced by $300,000. Therefore, the net impact on assets and liabilities is a decrease in cash and an increase in salary expense. The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the impact on cash and salary expense.",
