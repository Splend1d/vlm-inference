Over time, they migrated out of Africa and into other regions, such as Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. This process of migration and expansion is supported by archaeological, genetic, and fossil evidence.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that anatomically modern humans evolved in Asia between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago and then migrated into Africa, Europe, Australia, and the Americas. However, the evidence suggests that modern humans originated in Africa, not Asia.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that anatomically modern humans evolved independently and simultaneously in Africa, Europe, and Asia and then migrated into Australia and the Americas. This contradicts the evidence, which suggests that modern humans originated in Africa, not in multiple regions at the same time.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa into Southwest Asia between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago and then spread into Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. While there is evidence of modern human migration out of Africa into Southwest Asia, the main migration out of Africa occurred between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago, not between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago.",
