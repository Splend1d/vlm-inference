That is, his wisdom consists in his recognition not only that he is ignorant of such essences but also that:\n\nA. justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.\nB. he knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.\nC. knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\nD. his method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.\n\nassistant:The passage suggests that Socrates' wisdom lies in his recognition of his ignorance, and his understanding that actions without knowledge of the essence or nature of certain things are rationally unjustified. \n\nOption A is not entirely accurate, as Socrates does not claim that admitting one knows nothing is a requirement of justice.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not mention that Socrates knows what he is supposed to be looking for.\n\nOption C is not supported by the passage, as Socrates' method of questioning about the essences is not directly criticized.\n\nOption D is not accurate, as the passage does not mention that Socrates' method of asking questions about essences is unjustified or that he does not know why he engages in such a practice.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option C: knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for. This is in line with the idea that Socrates recognizes his ignorance of the essences, and that without such knowledge actions are rationally unjustified.",
