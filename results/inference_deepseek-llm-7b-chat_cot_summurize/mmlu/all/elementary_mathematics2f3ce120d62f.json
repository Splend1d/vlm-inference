They started with $2000. If they spent $150 each day, which expression represents how much money they had after x days?\n\nA. 1850x\nB. 2000 \u2212150x\nC. 150x\nD. 2000 +150x\n\nassistant:Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. The Sojourn family started with $2000.\n2. They spent $150 each day.\n3. We need to find the expression that represents how much money they had after x days.\n\nLet's calculate their spending after x days:\n\n1. $150 * x = $150x\n2. Money they had after spending: $2000 - $150x\n\nNow let's compare the given options with our result:\n\nA. 1850x: This expression doesn't match our result.\nB. 2000 \u2212150x: This expression is similar to our result but with a minus sign.\nC. 150x: This expression is the same as our result.\nD. 2000 +150x: This expression is similar to our result but with a plus sign.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option C. 150x represents how much money they had after x days.",
