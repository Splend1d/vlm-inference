Aquinas was a 13th-century philosopher who wrote extensively on various topics, including metaphysics and epistemology. He believed that certain truths could be known with certainty through the use of reason alone, and he called these truths \"self-evident propositions.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided and see which one is not an example of a self-evident proposition according to Aquinas:\n\nA. \"Every whole is greater than its part.\" This proposition is a well-known principle from mathematics, and it can be intuitively understood without any prior knowledge or reasoning. Therefore, it can be considered a self-evident proposition.\n\nB. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\" This proposition is a quote from a religious text, and it does not involve any logical or mathematical principles that could be universally understood. Therefore, it is not an example of a self-evident proposition.\n\nC. \"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another.\" This proposition is a fundamental principle of equality in mathematics, and it can be intuitively understood without any prior knowledge or reasoning. Therefore, it can be considered a self-evident proposition.\n\nD. \"Man is a rational being.\" This proposition is a basic assumption about human nature, and it can be intuitively understood without any prior knowledge or reasoning. Therefore, it can be considered a self-evident proposition.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is not an example of a self-evident proposition according to Aquinas. Therefore, the answer is B.",
