Under the terms of its contract with the owner of the apartment building, the company agreed to carry out regular monthly inspections of the elevator and to make all necessary repairs. The elevator was installed in the apartment complex in January. For the next 10 months, the company made regular inspections. However, starting in November, the company began to have some difficulties with its employees and failed to send inspectors out for three successive months. On February 20, a woman went to visit her friend, who was a tenant on the 20th floor of the building. The woman used the intercom to call up to the friend, who buzzed to unlock the front door so that the woman could enter the building. The woman headed to the elevator. When the doors opened, several people were already inside the elevator, apparently having entered the elevator from the parking garage below the building. One of the people in the elevator was a man who acted shifty and nervous. By the 12th floor, only four persons were left, including the woman and the man. At that floor, the other two people left, leaving the woman and the man alone on the elevator. Apprehensive at finding herself alone with such an unkempt stranger, the woman pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out and hoping to find other persons on that floor. Unfortunately, the elevator stalled, and came to a stop between the 12th and 13th floors. The woman's fears were justified, as the man suddenly grabbed at her purse.

Two weeks later, the police arrested the man and found the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault that had occurred in the apartment building.

This is because the company had a contractual obligation to perform these inspections and make necessary repairs, and their failure to do so may have contributed to the woman's injuries.\n\nHowever, the woman may also be found partially at fault for her own injuries, as she could have exited the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants left, but chose not to. This may result in a reduction of her damages award.\n\nIn conclusion, the woman has a strong case, but her recovery may depend on the outcome of her negligence lawsuit. The owner of the apartment building may be held vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator, but the woman's own actions may also be considered in determining her recovery.",
