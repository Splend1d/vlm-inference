You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte causes the release of proteolytic enzymes which act to prevent polyspermy. The events just described entail the\n\nA. zona reaction\nB. acrosomal reaction\nC. cortical reaction\nD. fertilization reaction\n\nassistant:The events described involve the cortical reaction.\n\nThe cortical reaction is a series of events that occur in the sea urchin oocyte after a rise in intracellular free calcium. This increase in calcium triggers the release of proteolytic enzymes, which are involved in the prevention of polyspermy. Polyspermy occurs when multiple sperm cells penetrate the zona pellucida surrounding the oocyte, and only one fertilization is desired. The proteolytic enzymes act to degrade the zona pellucida and allow the penetrated sperm cells to be expelled from the oocyte.\n\nThe zona reaction, acrosomal reaction, and fertilization reaction are not the correct answer for the following reasons:\n\nA. Zona reaction: This is a term used to describe the response of the zona pellucida to the actions of proteolytic enzymes during the cortical reaction. It is not the main event described.\n\nB. Acrosomal reaction: This is not related to the events described in the question. The acrosome reaction is a separate process that occurs during fertilization in mammalian oocytes, in which the acrosome on the sperm cell fuses with the oocyte's plasma membrane to release enzymes that digest the zona pellucida.\n\nC. Cortical reaction: This is the correct answer as described above.\n\nD. Fertilization reaction: This is not the correct answer because it is a general term that encompasses the events that occur during fertilization, which is not the focus of the question. The events described in the question specifically involve the cortical reaction.",
