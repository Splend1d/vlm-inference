This can be caused by factors such as increased demand for goods and services, decreased supply, or increased costs of production.\n\nOne way to combat inflation is through a fiscal policy that involves increased government spending and taxes. By increasing government spending, the government can help stimulate the economy and increase demand for goods and services. This can help to lower prices and combat inflation.\n\nAt the same time, increasing taxes can help to reduce inflation by reducing the amount of money available in the economy. This can help to decrease demand for goods and services and reduce prices.\n\nTherefore, a combination of increased taxes and government spending is the most appropriate fiscal policy to remedy inflation.",
