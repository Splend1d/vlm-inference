Everest from the depth of the Mariana Trench.\n\n35,840 feet (depth of the Mariana Trench) - 29,028 feet (height of Mt. Everest) = 6,812 feet\n\nSince the options provided are not exact, we can round the result to the nearest option:\n\n6,812 feet \u2248 6,000 feet (A)\n\nSo the best estimate of the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth is approximately 6,000 feet.",
