If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli?\n\nA. Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)\nB. Decreased hydrostatic pressure\nC. Decreased oncotic pressure\nD. Increased hydrostatic pressure\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between afferent arterial pressure, efferent arteriole constriction, and Starling forces in renal glomeruli.\n\nAfferent arterial pressure: This is the pressure of blood entering the glomerulus (the filtration unit of the kidney).\n\nEfferent arteriole constriction: This is the narrowing of the efferent arteriole, which controls the blood flow to the glomerulus.\n\nStarling forces: These forces are responsible for the regulation of blood flow in blood vessels and are composed of three components: the filtration coefficient (Kf), the hydrostatic pressure, and the oncotic pressure.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf): This would occur if the glomeruli were damaged or if there was a change in the size or number of filtration pores. However, constriction of the efferent arteriole would not directly affect Kf.\n\nB. Decreased hydrostatic pressure: As the efferent arteriole is constricted, the pressure inside the glomerulus would decrease due to the reduced blood flow. This would lead to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus, not a decrease.\n\nC. Decreased oncotic pressure: This is the pressure exerted by plasma proteins in the blood. It is not directly influenced by efferent arteriole constriction.\n\nD. Increased hydrostatic pressure: This would be the most likely change in the glomeruli if the efferent arteriole is constricted. As the blood flow to the glomerulus is reduced, the pressure within the glomerulus would increase due to the reduced flow of blood.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely change in Starling forces in renal glomeruli due to efferent arteriole constriction is increased hydrostatic pressure.",
