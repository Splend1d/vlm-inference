Latin America has excelled in poetry.\nB. Latin America had made significant scientific contributions.\nC. Latin America had a prophecy regarding these events.\nD. Latin America has had a rich culture for centuries.\n\nassistant:The poet Ruben Dario's purpose in discussing \"our America, that has had poets since ancient times, . . . that consulted the stars\" is to highlight the rich culture and history of Latin America, which has been home to poets and civilizations for centuries. This is evident in the following lines: \"that since the remote times of its life has lived on light, on fire, on perfume, on love, America of the great Montezuma, of the Inca, the fragrant America of Christopher Columbus, Catholic America, Spanish America, the America in which noble Cuauht\u00e9moc said: 'I'm not in a bed of roses', that America that trembles in hurricanes and lives on love, it lives, you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul. And it dreams. And it loves, and it vibrates, and it is the daughter of the sun.\"\n\nRuben Dario uses these lines to emphasize the depth and diversity of Latin American culture, which has been shaped by its history, religion, and traditions. The mention of ancient civilizations like Montezuma, the Inca, and Christopher Columbus highlights the region's rich history, while the use of phrases like \"lives on love\" and \"vibrates\" conveys the idea that Latin America is a vibrant and dynamic place.\n\nAdditionally, the poet refers to the region as \"our America,\" which suggests a sense of pride and ownership. This is further emphasized in the lines: \"there are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion. Roosevelt, one would have to be, through God himself, the-fearful rifleman and strong hunter, to manage to grab us in your iron claws. And, although you count on everything, you lack one thing: God!\"\n\nIn this context, the poet is using the phrase \"our America\" to emphasize the connection between the people of Latin America and their shared history, culture, and traditions. By discussing the region's rich cultural heritage, Ruben Dario is asserting the importance of preserving and protecting this legacy, even in the face of external threats.\n\nIn conclusion, the poet Ruben Dario's purpose in discussing \"our America, that has had poets since ancient times, . . . that consulted the stars\" is to highlight the region's rich cultural heritage and history, emphasizing the depth and diversity of Latin America's traditions, history, and traditions. By doing so, he is asserting the importance of preserving and protecting this legacy, even in the face of external threats.",
