Both of these\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which light can cause the emission of electrons from a material. This effect was first observed by Hertz in 1887 and was later explained by Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nAccording to the particle model, the photoelectric effect can be explained by the idea that light is made up of particles called photons. When a photon collides with a material, it can transfer some of its energy to an electron in the material, causing the electron to be ejected from the material.\n\nOn the other hand, the wave model of light states that light is a wave that can be described by its wavelength and amplitude. This model does not explain the photoelectric effect.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B. particle model.",
