If the product of their numbers was $32-8i$, and Hardy picked $5+3i$, what number did Ramanujan pick?\n\nA. 32-8i\nB. 5+3i\nC. 4-i\nD. 4-4i\n\nassistant:Let's denote Ramanujan's number as $a+bi$ and Hardy's number as $5+3i$. The product of their numbers is $(a+bi)(5+3i) = a(5+3i) + b(3+5i) = (5a+3b) + (3b+5a)i$. We know that this product is $32-8i$, so we can set up the equation $(5a+3b) + (3b+5a)i = 32-8i$.\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for $a$ and $b$. First, we can simplify the equation by collecting like terms:\n\n$(5a+3b) + (3b+5a)i = 32-8i$\n\n$(5a+3b) + (3b-5a)i = 32+4i$\n\nNow, let's equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: $5a+3b = 32$\nImaginary part: $3b-5a = 4$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express $b$ in terms of $a$:\n\n$b = \\frac{32-5a}{3}$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $b$ into the second equation:\n\n$3\\left(\\frac{32-5a}{3}\\right) - 5a = 4$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$\\frac{96-15a}{3} - 5a = 4$\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n$96-15a-15a-15a = 12$\n\n$396-45a = 12$\n\nNow, solve for $a$:\n\n$-45a = -384$\n\n$a = \\frac{384}{45} \\approx 8.67$\n\nNow that we have the value of $a$, we can find the value of $b$:\n\n$b = \\frac{32-5\\left(\\frac{384}{45}\\right)}{3} \\approx \\frac{32-192}{3} \\approx -17.07$\n\nSince we cannot have a negative imaginary number, there is no real solution for Ramanujan's number in this case.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not among the given options.",
