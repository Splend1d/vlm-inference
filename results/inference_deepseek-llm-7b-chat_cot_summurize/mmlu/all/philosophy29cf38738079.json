He presents four options:\n\n1. If pleasure and goodness are the same thing, then saying pleasure is good is equivalent to saying that it is good.\n2. If good is something different than pleasure, then saying pleasure is good means that the pleasure is something that is good.\n3. If all good things are pleasant, then saying that something is good means that it is pleasant.\n4. If all pleasant things are good, then saying that something is pleasant means that it is good.\n\nMoore's argument is that there is no meaningful connection between pleasure and goodness without these additional conditions. The question asks which of the options is the meaning of Moore's argument, and the answer is B. good is something different than pleasure.",
