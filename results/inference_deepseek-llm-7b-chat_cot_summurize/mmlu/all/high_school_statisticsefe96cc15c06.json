Which of the following is the highest amount of rainfall, in inches, this city could have this month for the month to be among the 10percent driest months the city has seen?\n\nA. 8.05\nB. 7.6\nC. 3.95\nD. 3.37\n\nassistant:To find the highest amount of rainfall (answer choice A) that makes the month the 10th driest month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the z-score for 10% of the driest months:\n   z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n   z = (10 - 6) / 1.6\n   z = 4 / 1.6\n   z \u2248 2.5\n\n2. Find the rainfall amount for this z-score:\n   x = z\u03c3 + \u03bc\n   x = 2.5 * 1.6 + 6\n   x \u2248 7.6\n\nAnswer B, 7.6, is the highest amount of rainfall (in inches) for the month to be among the 10th driest months the city has seen.",
