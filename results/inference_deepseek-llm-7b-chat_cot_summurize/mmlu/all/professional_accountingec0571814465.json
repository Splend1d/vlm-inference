Removing pressures to meet unrealistic targets, particularly for short-term results.\nD. Specifying the competence levels for every job in an organization and translating those levels to requisite knowledge and skills.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the context of the question, which is related to ethical behavior and COSO.\n2. Recall the information I have been trained on, specifically about COSO and its methods to transmit ethical behavior.\n3. Analyze the options provided and determine which one aligns with the information I have been trained on.\n\nStep 1: Understand the context\nCOSO stands for the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, which is a group of five private-sector organizations that focuses on risk management and control framework. One of the key principles of COSO's framework is the importance of ethical behavior within an organization.\n\nStep 2: Recall the information I have been trained on\nI have been trained on COSO's framework, which emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior. One of the key components of this framework is the management of ethics and compliance, which includes promoting ethical behavior throughout the organization, communicating ethical expectations, and addressing misconduct.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options and determine the correct answer\nA. Demonstrating appropriate behavior by example: This is one way to promote ethical behavior, but it may not be the most effective method according to COSO.\nB. Strengthening internal audit\u2019s ability to deter and report improper behavior: This is an important aspect of managing ethics and compliance, but it may not be the most effective method to transmit ethical behavior throughout the organization.\nC. Removing pressures to meet unrealistic targets, particularly for short-term results: This may help to create an environment that supports ethical behavior, but it may not be the most effective method to transmit ethical behavior throughout the organization.\nD. Specifying the competence levels for every job in an organization and translating those levels to requisite knowledge and skills: This method aligns with the COSO framework, as it provides clear expectations and knowledge for employees to follow, promoting ethical behavior.\n\nBased on my analysis, the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization, according to COSO, is option D: Specifying the competence levels for every job in an organization and translating those levels to requisite knowledge and skills.",
