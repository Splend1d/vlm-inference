Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.\nD. Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n\nA federal grand jury can subpoena documents and testimony from individuals and corporations as part of its investigation. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is a protection that applies to individuals, not corporations. Therefore, a corporation cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment to object to the subpoena. The subpoena can be enforced, and the corporation must produce all emails and internal documents regarding the corporation's knowledge of the risks of an oil spill.",
