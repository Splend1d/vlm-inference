Its first element is stored at physical address 8,192.\nAssume that only arrays A and B can be cached in an initially empty, physically addressed, physically tagged, direct-mapped, 2K-byte cache with an 8-byte block size. The following loop is then executed.\nfor (i = 0; i < 256; i++)\n        A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];\nDuring the execution of the loop, how many bytes will be written to memory if the cache has a write-through policy?\n\nA. 0\nB. 256\nC. 1024\nD. 2048\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bytes written to memory during the execution of the loop.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the cache behavior when the write-through policy is used. The cache will store the elements of arrays A and B that are accessed during the loop. When the cache is full, some elements will be evicted to make space for new elements.\n\nLet's assume that the cache stores the following elements from arrays A and B:\n\n- Array A: [0, 1, 2, ..., 128]\n- Array B: [0, 1, 2, ..., 128]\n\nThe cache will be filled with 256 elements, and all the elements from arrays A and B will be stored in the cache.\n\nDuring the execution of the loop, the cache will be updated with the following elements:\n\n- Array A: [0, 1, 2, ..., 128]\n- Array B: [0, 1, 2, ..., 128]\n- A[0] = A[0] + B[0]\n- A[1] = A[1] + B[2]\n- ...\n- A[128] = A[128] + B[256]\n\nThe cache will be updated with 129 elements, and the last element will overwrite the element stored in the cache for array B.\n\nTherefore, during the execution of the loop, 129 elements will be written to memory, and 128 elements will be written to array B. So, the total number of bytes written to memory is 4 * 128 = 512 bytes.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 256.",
