The productivity of labor in country X is 33 percent higher than in country Z.\nD. The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as country Z.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Country X has 30,000 units of output and 3,000 workers.\n2. Country Z has 40,000 units of output and 8,000 workers.\n\nWe can find the productivity of labor (output per worker) in each country by dividing the total output by the number of workers:\n\nCountry X:\nProductivity = 30,000 units / 3,000 workers = 10 units per worker\n\nCountry Z:\nProductivity = 40,000 units / 8,000 workers = 5 units per worker\n\nNow, we can compare the productivity of labor between the two countries:\n\nCountry X: 10 units per worker\nCountry Z: 5 units per worker\n\nTo find the difference in productivity between the two countries, we can subtract the productivity of Country X from that of Country Z:\n\nDifference = 5 units per worker - 10 units per worker = -5 units per worker\n\nSince the difference is negative, it means that the productivity of labor in Country Z is lower than in Country X. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The productivity of labor in country Z is 25 percent higher than in country X.",
