The assistant died intestate, leaving his daughter as his only surviving heir. The friend agreed to convey his interest in the apartment building to the daughter during the administration of the assistant's estate.\n\nBased on these facts, the correct answer is C. The conveyance should be made to the daughter and her heirs and assigns, as the friend agreed to convey his interest in the apartment building to the daughter.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the daughter is not a successor or assign of the estate of the assistant. Option B is incorrect because the daughter is already the heir of the assistant, and the friend's conveyance would benefit her and her heirs. Option D is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the initial devise of the apartment building to the user and their assistant as tenants in common.",
