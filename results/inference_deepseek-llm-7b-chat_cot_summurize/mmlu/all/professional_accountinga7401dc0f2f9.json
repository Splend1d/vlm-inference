Before reissuing the report, the CPA should\n\nA. Obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management.\nB. Make inquiries of the former client's attorney regarding pending litigation.\nC. Review the former client's records to verify its compliance with debt and loan agreements.\nD. Consider whether there is substantial doubt about the former client's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management.\n\nBefore reissuing an auditor's report for a former audit client, a CPA must ensure that the report is accurate and complies with professional standards. One way to do this is to obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management. This letter confirms that the client's records and financial statements have not changed since the original audit, and that the CPA is authorized to reissue the auditor's report.\n\nWhile the other options may be relevant in certain situations, they are not necessary before reissuing an auditor's report. For example, making inquiries of the former client's attorney regarding pending litigation may be relevant if the litigation could affect the client's financial statements, but it is not necessary to reissue the auditor's report. Similarly, reviewing the former client's records to verify its compliance with debt and loan agreements may be relevant if the agreements are relevant to the financial statements, but it is not necessary to reissue the auditor's report. Finally, considering whether there is substantial doubt about the former client's ability to continue as a going concern may be relevant if the client's ability to continue as a going concern has changed since the original audit, but it is not necessary to reissue the auditor's report.",
