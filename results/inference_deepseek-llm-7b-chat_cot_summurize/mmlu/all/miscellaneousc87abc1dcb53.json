Marine biological activity: While marine biological activity does contribute to the formation of salts, it is not the primary source of dissolved salts in oceans.\n\nB. Atmospheric deposition: Atmospheric deposition can introduce salts into the ocean, but it is not the main source of dissolved salts in oceans.\n\nC. The weathering of continental rocks: Weathering of continental rocks is the primary source of dissolved salts in oceans. As rocks weather, they release minerals and salts into the water, which dissolve and become part of the ocean.\n\nD. The eruptions of undersea hot-spot volcanoes: While eruptions can release salts into the ocean, they are not the primary source of dissolved salts in oceans.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is C. The weathering of continental rocks.",
