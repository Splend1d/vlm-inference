The man, because a landowner has an absolute right to have his land supported by the neighboring land.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The man, because a landowner has an absolute right to have his land supported by the neighboring land.\n\nThe text describes a situation where the nephew was excavating a basement on his land, and the side of the excavation collapsed, causing damage to the man's land. The text does not provide enough information to determine whether the nephew was conducting the excavation work negligently or not. Therefore, the nephew should be held responsible for the damage to the man's land.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the nephew had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the excavation work to avoid causing harm to the man's land.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the man is not entitled to have his land supported by the neighboring land in its improved state.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the nephew was not conducting the excavation work negligently, as stated in the text.",
