Which solution should be used to complete bladder washout?\n\nA. Solution R.\nB. Normal saline.\nC. Solution G.\nD. Any of the above.\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Normal saline.\n\nA 67-year-old man who has undergone transurethral resection of the prostate with irrigation and has a blocked catheter needs to have the bladder washed out to prevent infection and remove any residual debris. Normal saline is the appropriate solution to use for bladder washout in this situation. It is a sterile, isotonic solution that helps to flush out any residual debris and promotes healing.\n\nSolution R, which is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, isotonic solution that contains sodium chloride, is another option that could be used for bladder washout. However, it is not as commonly used as normal saline.\n\nSolution G, which is a sterile, isotonic solution that contains glycine, is another option that could be used for bladder washout. Glycine helps to prevent crystalluria and reduce the risk of urinary tract stones. However, it is not as commonly used as normal saline or Solution R.\n\nAnswer D, \"Any of the above\", is not a valid choice because normal saline is the most commonly used and appropriate solution for bladder washout in this situation.",
