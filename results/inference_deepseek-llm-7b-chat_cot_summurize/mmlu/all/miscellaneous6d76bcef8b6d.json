You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: What quantity of oxygen, O_2 , contains very nearly the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water, H_2O ?\n\nA. 64.0 grams\nB. 32.0 grams\nC. 16.0 grams\nD. 8.0 grams\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to use the molar masses of O_2 and H_2O. The molar mass of O_2 is approximately 32 g/mol, and the molar mass of H_2O is 18 g/mol. We need to find the mass of O_2 that contains the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of H_2O.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of molecules of H_2O in 36.0 grams. We do this by dividing the mass of H_2O by its molar mass:\n\n36.0 grams / 18 g/mol = 2 moles of H_2O\n\nNext, we need to determine the mass of O_2 that contains the same number of molecules as 2 moles of H_2O. We do this by dividing the mass of O_2 by its molar mass:\n\n2 moles of H_2O * 32 g/mol = 64.0 grams\n\nTherefore, the mass of O_2 that contains very nearly the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of H_2O is 64.0 grams. The correct answer is A.",
