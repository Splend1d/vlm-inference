The statement was written by a group of young activists who were concerned about social and political issues in the United States, including racial segregation, the threat of nuclear war, and the decline of democratic values.\n\nThe passage mentions that the growth of the organization that published the statement can best be understood in the context of the 1960s. This suggests that the organization was likely active during this time and that its growth was influenced by the social and political issues of the era.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option A refers to rapid industrialization, urban growth and congestion, and corporate consolidation. While these may have been factors that affected the broader society, they do not directly relate to the specific issues addressed in the Port Huron Statement.\n\nOption B refers to the baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education. While the baby boom and expansion of higher education may have influenced the composition of the organization's membership, these factors do not directly explain the organization's growth.\n\nOption C refers to economic polarization, supply-side economic policies, and the disappearance of the middle class. While economic issues may have impacted the broader society, they do not directly relate to the specific issues addressed in the Port Huron Statement.\n\nOption D refers to the proliferation of personal computer technologies, the rise of Christian fundamentalism, and an increase in student apathy. While these may have been factors that affected the broader society, they do not directly relate to the specific issues addressed in the Port Huron Statement.\n\nBased on the context provided, the most appropriate answer is option B, which refers to the growth of the organization that published the Port Huron Statement in the context of the baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education. The baby boom generation may have been more likely to become involved in social and political issues, and the rapid expansion of higher education may have provided more opportunities for young people to engage in activism.",
