Which of the following must be true of multiprogrammed systems in order that a single copy of a program can be shared by several users?\nI. The program is a macro.\nII. The program is recursive.\nIII. The program is reentrant.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. II and III only\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's analyze each statement and determine which of them must be true for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system.\n\nI. The program is a macro.\n- A macro is a sequence of instructions that can be stored and called repeatedly. However, it does not necessarily mean that the program can be shared by several users.\n\nII. The program is recursive.\n- A recursive program is a program that calls itself. This does not necessarily mean that the program can be shared by several users.\n\nIII. The program is reentrant.\n- A reentrant program is a program that can be safely interrupted and resumed without interfering with the program's state. This means that the program can be safely shared by several users without causing conflicts or data corruption.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system is that the program is reentrant (statement III). Therefore, the correct answer is C. III only.",
