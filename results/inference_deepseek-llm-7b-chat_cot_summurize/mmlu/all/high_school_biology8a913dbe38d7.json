Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\nD. Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\n\nWater potential is a measure of the ability of a solution to attract water molecules. It is influenced by both solute potential (the ability of the solute particles to attract water molecules) and pressure potential (the pressure difference between the solution and the environment).\n\nIn the given scenario, the dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed in a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. This creates a concentration gradient, with the 0.5 M solution having a lower solute potential and the 0.6 M solution having a higher solute potential. The water molecules in the 0.5 M solution will be attracted to the higher solute potential of the 0.6 M solution, causing them to move from the lower water potential region to the higher water potential region. This process is known as osmosis.\n\nOption B is incorrect because solute potential is not the only factor that determines water potential. Pressure potential also plays a role.\n\nOption C is incorrect because pressure potential does not combine with solute potential to determine water potential. Both factors contribute independently to the overall water potential.\n\nOption D is incorrect because water potential does not always drive water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential. The direction of water movement is determined by the difference in solute potential between the two regions.",
