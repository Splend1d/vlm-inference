Check your answer.\n\nA. 1 over 6\nB. 6\nC. 1 over 216\nD. 216\n\nassistant:To solve the equation -6x = -36, we first need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -6.\n\n(-6x)/(-6) = (-36)/(-6)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 6\n\nNow, we can check the answer by plugging the value of x back into the original equation:\n\n-6(6) = -36\n\n-36 = -36\n\nThe equation holds true, confirming that x = 6 is the correct answer.\n\nNow, let's check which answer option corresponds to this solution:\n\nA. 1/6\nB. 6\nC. 1/216\nD. 216\n\nThe correct answer is B. 6.",
