The parties entered into a valid, written construction contract that contained a provision that called for an architect's certificate of completion. After completion of the cottage, the owner hired an architect to inspect the contractor's work and issue the certificate. The architect refused in bad faith to execute the certificate. The contractor then sued the owner for the entire contract amount. The owner argued that the lack of issuance of the certificate excused her from further performance under the contract. Upon hearing this argument, most courts will\n\nA. order the architect to execute the certificate.\nB. require the contractor to proceed in equity for reformation to eliminate the clause.\nC. award the contractor damages against the architect.\nD. excuse the condition and require the owner to pay damages to the contractor.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. excuse the condition and require the owner to pay damages to the contractor.\n\nIn this situation, the owner hired a general contractor to build a summer cottage on their land, and the contract required an architect's certificate of completion before the owner was obligated to pay the contractor. The owner hired an architect to inspect the work and issue the certificate, but the architect refused to do so in bad faith. The contractor sued the owner for the entire contract amount, but the owner argued that the lack of issuance of the certificate excused them from further performance under the contract.\n\nMost courts would likely agree with the owner's argument and excuse the condition (i.e., the requirement for the architect's certificate of completion) since the architect refused to issue the certificate in bad faith. As a result, the owner would not be required to pay the contractor the full contract amount. Instead, the owner would likely be required to pay damages to the contractor for any work already completed and the contractor's costs and expenses incurred in the project, including the costs of the architect's inspection.",
