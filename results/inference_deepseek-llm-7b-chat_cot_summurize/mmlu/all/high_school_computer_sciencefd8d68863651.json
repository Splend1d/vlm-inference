Changing line 3 to a \u2190 b + 10 will not affect the results when the code segment is executed. The code segment is checking if a is equal to 0, and if it is, it sets b to a + 10. If a is not equal to 0, it sets b to a + 20. Therefore, changing line 3 to a \u2190 b + 10 will not affect the results because it is only being used in the case where a is not equal to 0.",
