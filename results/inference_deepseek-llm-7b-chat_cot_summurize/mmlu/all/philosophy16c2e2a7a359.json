God\nC. nature\nD. an infinite series\n\nassistant:Aquinas, a famous philosopher and theologian, believed that the first efficient cause of everything is God. This concept is based on his belief in the existence of a supreme being who created and sustains the universe.\n\nAquinas's argument for this belief is based on the idea of causality. He believed that everything that exists has a cause, and the ultimate cause of everything must be something that does not depend on anything else for its existence. In other words, it must be a self-existent, uncreated being.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, the universe itself is not the first efficient cause of everything, because it is created by God. Nature is also not the first efficient cause, because it is a part of the created order and is dependent on God for its existence. An infinite series of causes is also not the first efficient cause, because it would still require an ultimate cause that is not dependent on anything else.\n\nTherefore, according to Aquinas, the first efficient cause of everything is God.",
