Micah ate an odd number of apples.\n\nWe need to find a group that can represent both the even number of strawberries and the odd number of apples. Let's check the given options:\n\nA. SSSSS; AAA: 5 strawberries (odd number) and 3 apples (odd number). Not a match.\nB. SSSSS; AAAA: 5 strawberries (odd number) and 4 apples (even number). Not a match.\nC. SSSSSSSS; AAAA: 8 strawberries (even number) and 4 apples (even number). Not a match.\nD. SSSSSSSS; A: 7 strawberries (odd number) and 1 apple (odd number). This matches both the even number of strawberries and the odd number of apples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.",
