Scenario 1 | I opened the gas tank and filled it with with gasoline. Scenario 2 | He went to work, and I married another.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in the first scenario, \"I opened the gas tank and filled it with gasoline,\" does something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Filling a gas tank with gasoline is dangerous and can cause harm to people, property, and the environment. This action is considered morally wrong because it violates the principle of harm prevention and the principle of respecting property.\n\nIn the second scenario, \"He went to work, and I married another,\" it is not clear if the main character's actions are morally wrong. The statement does not provide enough information to determine if the actions taken by the main character are morally wrong or not. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.",
