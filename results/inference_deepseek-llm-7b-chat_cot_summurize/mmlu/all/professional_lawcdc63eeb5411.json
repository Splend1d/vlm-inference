The contractor is also partially at fault, with a degree of negligence of 35%. The subcontractor is also partially at fault, with a degree of negligence of 25%.\n\nSince the employee's degree of negligence is greater than the contractor's degree of negligence, the employee will not be able to recover any damages from the contractor. However, the employee can still recover damages from the subcontractor, as their degree of negligence is less than the employee's degree of negligence.\n\nTherefore, the employee will most likely recover $0 from the contractor, but will be able to recover damages from the subcontractor. The total damages awarded to the employee will be reduced by his degree of negligence, which is 40%. So, the employee will recover $100,000 - (40% of $100,000) = $60,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The employee will recover $100,000.",
