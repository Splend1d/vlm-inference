Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.\n\nMitochondria and chloroplasts are organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are present in animal and plant cells, while chloroplasts are found only in plant cells. Mitochondria are involved in energy production, while chloroplasts are involved in photosynthesis. Therefore, it is generally true that plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria, and animals and fungi have only mitochondria.",
