The neighbor agreed to change the oil in the man's car for $50, but he later offered an additional $25 if the job was completed by the next morning. This new contract superseded the original $50 contract, making the total amount the neighbor should receive $75. The neighbor did complete the job, so she should win the lawsuit and be awarded the $75.\n\nIn options A and D, the neighbor did not perform her part of the bargain, so she could not win based on that. In option C, the $75 contract did not supersede the $50 contract, which is incorrect because the $75 contract was a new agreement made after the original $50 agreement.",
