Ravenstein.\n\nRavenstein's law, also known as the law of migration, states that most migration occurs over short distances and in steps. This theory is often referred to as the \"punctuated equilibrium\" model of migration, and it has been widely used to explain patterns of migration in human societies. The other options are not directly related to this theory.",
