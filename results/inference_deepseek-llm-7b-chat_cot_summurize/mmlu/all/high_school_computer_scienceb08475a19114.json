E4_{16}\nC. E7_{16}\nD. F4_{16}\n\nassistant:To determine the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 231_{10}, we first need to convert the decimal number to hexadecimal. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 16 until we reach a single digit.\n\n231 \ufffd 16 = 14 R 4\n14 \ufffd 16 = 0 R 10\n10 \ufffd 16 = 0 R 10\n\nSo, the hexadecimal representation of 231_{10} is 14F_{16}.\n\nNow, we can check which option matches this hexadecimal representation:\n\nA. 17_{16}\nB. E4_{16}\nC. E7_{16}\nD. F4_{16}\n\nThe correct answer is A. 17_{16}.",
