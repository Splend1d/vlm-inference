He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of\n\nA. both indictments.\nB. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.\nC. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\nD. neither of the indictments.\n\nassistant:The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss both of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is the principle that a person cannot be tried again for the same crime after having been acquitted or convicted. In this case, the drug dealer had already been convicted of possession with intent to distribute narcotics, and his attorney argued that this conviction should prevent him from being indicted again for the same crime.\n\nThe question asks for the most likely outcome of the double jeopardy motions. Given the information provided, it is likely that the drug dealer's attorney would succeed in having the state indictment dismissed, as it would be considered double jeopardy to try the drug dealer again for the same crime after he has already been convicted in state court. However, it is less likely that the federal indictment would be dismissed, as the double jeopardy principle does not apply to federal courts.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is C. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.",
