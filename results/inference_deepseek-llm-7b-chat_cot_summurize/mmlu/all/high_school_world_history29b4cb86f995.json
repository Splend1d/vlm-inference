In this speech, Pope Urban II calls for a holy war against the Muslims, who he describes as a sinful and alien race that has invaded and desecrated Christian lands. He urges the Christians to avenge these wrongs and recover the lost territories. The reference to the kingdom of the Greeks being dismembered and the holy sepulchre of the Lord being held captive by the Muslims also indicates the context of the Crusades. Therefore, the correct answer is D. The Crusades.",
