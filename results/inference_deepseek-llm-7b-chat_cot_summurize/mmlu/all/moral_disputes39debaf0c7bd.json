Instead, Huemer argues that the harm to individuals from drug use should not be a justification for state intervention, as this would violate the rights of individuals to make their own decisions about their lives. Instead, he advocates for a public health approach to drug use, which includes raising awareness about the risks and dangers of drug use and providing support and resources to help individuals who do use drugs to avoid harm. This approach does not require state prohibition, but rather focuses on education, prevention, and treatment.",
