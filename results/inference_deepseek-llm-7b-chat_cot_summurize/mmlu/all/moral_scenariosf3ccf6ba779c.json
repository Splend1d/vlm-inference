Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in the first scenario, who sold exotic wild animals at the farmer's market, is engaging in an activity that can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because the sale of exotic animals can contribute to the decline of wild populations and exacerbate animal suffering.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character has discovered something new while working late, but there is not enough information provided to determine whether their actions are morally wrong or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.",
