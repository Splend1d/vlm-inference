Which of the following is true if an excise tax is now imposed on the production of good X?\n\nA. If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax.\nB. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is more elastic.\nC. Consumer surplus rises as a result of the tax.\nD. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\n\nAn excise tax is a tax imposed on a specific good or service, typically based on its production or consumption. In this case, the tax is imposed on the production of good X. This will increase the cost of producing good X, and therefore, the price of good X will increase as well.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that the price will rise by the amount of the tax. The extent of the price increase will depend on the demand curve, which represents the relationship between the price of good X and the quantity of good X demanded by consumers. If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price will rise by the amount of the tax. However, if the demand curve is more elastic, the price increase may be smaller.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that the consumer's burden of the tax will rise as the demand curve is more elastic. The extent of the price increase will depend on the demand curve, not the elasticity of the demand curve.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that consumer surplus will rise as a result of the tax. Consumer surplus is the difference between the price a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the price they actually pay for the good. If the price of good X increases as a result of the tax, consumer surplus may decrease.",
