This is because in this case, the consumer has no choice but to purchase the good at the higher price, as there is no alternative good that they can substitute for it.\n\nOn the other hand, when the demand is elastic and the supply is inelastic, the tax burden falls mainly on the producer. This is because the consumer can easily switch to a different good, which leads to a decrease in the price of the good, and the producer bears the burden of the tax.\n\nWhen the demand is elastic and the supply is elastic, the tax burden is shared between the consumer and the producer. The consumer can still switch to a different good, but the producer can also adjust the price of the good to reflect the tax.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. the tax burden falls mainly on the consumer if the demand is inelastic and the supply is inelastic.",
