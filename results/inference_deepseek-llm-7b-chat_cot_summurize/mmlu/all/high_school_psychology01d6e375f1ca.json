This controversy relates to whether developmental changes occur gradually over time, or whether they occur in leaps or sudden changes (discontinuities). The other options do not directly relate to the stages of development:\n\nA. nature versus nurture: This controversy relates to the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors in shaping an individual's development.\n\nC. stability versus change: This controversy relates to the relative importance of stability and change in shaping an individual's development.\n\nD. subjectivity versus objectivity: This controversy relates to the relative importance of subjective personal experiences versus objective, measurable factors in shaping an individual's development.",
