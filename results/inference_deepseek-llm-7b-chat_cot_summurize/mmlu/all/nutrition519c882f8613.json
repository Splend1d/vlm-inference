The RQ can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nRQ = VO2 / VCO2\n\nWhere VO2 is the amount of oxygen consumed and VCO2 is the amount of carbon dioxide produced.\n\nOption A is correct. The respiration quotient (RQ) is defined as the ratio of VO2 divided by VCO2.\n\nOption B is also correct. On a high carbohydrate diet, the body primarily uses carbohydrates for energy, which leads to a lower VO2 and higher VCO2, resulting in a lower RQ.\n\nOption C is incorrect. Fasting does not have a significant impact on the RQ, as the body continues to use fat and protein as energy sources during fasting.\n\nOption D is also incorrect. The RQ is always less than or equal to 1.0. If the body is converting exogenous carbohydrate to endogenous fat, the VO2 would decrease and VCO2 would increase, resulting in a lower RQ.",
