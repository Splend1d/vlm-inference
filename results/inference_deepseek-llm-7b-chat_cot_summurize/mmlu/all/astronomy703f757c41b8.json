If the acceleration due to gravity on Mars is (roughly) 4 m/s2 and the surface area of Mars is about 145000000 square km what is the approximate mass of the martian atmosphere?\n\nA. 2.2x1011 kg\nB. 2.2x1014kg\nC. 2.2x1020kg\nD. 2.2x1016 kg\n\nassistant:To find the approximate mass of the Martian atmosphere, we can use the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law states that PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the pressure (P = 600 pascals), the acceleration due to gravity (g = 4 m/s\u00b2), and the surface area (A = 145,000,000 square km). We can use these values to find the volume of the atmosphere.\n\nFirst, let's convert the pressure from pascals to atmospheres:\n600 pascals = 600/1013.25 atmospheres\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume of the Martian atmosphere:\nV = A \\* g\nV = (145,000,000 square km) \\* (4 m/s\u00b2)\nV = 58,000,000,000,000 cubic meters\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of gas in the Martian atmosphere. We can use the ideal gas law to do this. Let's assume the temperature of the Martian atmosphere is the same as the average temperature on Earth (288 K). The gas constant R is 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K, and the temperature T is 288 K.\n\nn = (P \\* V \\* R \\* T) / (RT)\nn = (600 \\* 1.01325 \\* 58,000,000,000,000) / (8.314 \\* 288)\nn \u2248 3.87 \\* 1023 moles\n\nNow we can use the ideal gas law to find the mass of the Martian atmosphere:\nm = n \\* R\nm = 3.87 \\* 1023 moles \\* 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K\nm \u2248 3.33 \\* 1024 kg\n\nTherefore, the approximate mass of the Martian atmosphere is 3.33 x 1024 kg. The correct answer is D. 2.2x1016 kg.",
