It is desired to use the magnetic field of the Earth, 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 T, to bend the electron beam into a circle. What will be the radius of this circle?\n\nA. 1 nm\nB. 1 \u03bcm\nC. 1 mm\nD. 1 m\n\nassistant:To determine the radius of the circle that the electron beam will form, we need to use the formula for the centripetal force acting on the electron beam:\n\nFc = (mV\u00b2/r)\n\nwhere V is the velocity of the electrons, m is the mass of an electron, r is the radius of the circle, and Fc is the centripetal force.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the centripetal force:\n\nFc = (m \u00d7 V\u00b2/r)\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of an electron, which is approximately 9.109 \u00d7 10^-31 kg.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nFc = (9.109 \u00d7 10^-31 kg \u00d7 10^7 m/s\u00b2 \u00d7 10^7 m/s\u00b2) / r\n\nFc = (9.109 \u00d7 10^-22 kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2) / r\n\nWe know that the magnetic field of the Earth is 5 \u00d7 10^-5 T, which is equivalent to 5 \u00d7 10^-5 N/A. Since the speed of the electrons is 10^7 m/s, we can calculate the magnetic force acting on the electrons:\n\nFm = (q \u00d7 V \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-5 N/A \u00d7 10^7 m/s)\n\nFm = (q \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-5 N/A \u00d7 10^7 m/s)\n\nFm = (5 \u00d7 10^-5 N \u00d7 10^7 m/s)\n\nFm = 5 \u00d7 10^-3 N\n\nNow, we can use the equation Fc = Fm to find the radius:\n\n(9.109 \u00d7 10^-22 kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2) / r = 5 \u00d7 10^-3 N\n\nr = (5 \u00d7 10^-3 N \u00d7 9.109 \u00d7 10^-22 kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2) / (9.109 \u00d7 10^-22 kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2)\n\nr = 5 \u00d7 10^-2 m\n\nr = 500 nm\n\nTherefore, the radius of the electron beam circle will be 500 nm.
