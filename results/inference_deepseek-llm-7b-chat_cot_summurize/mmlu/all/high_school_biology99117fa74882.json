All habitats should have received applications of DDT at about the same time.\n\nThe question describes a situation where DDT was once considered a \"silver bullet\" for pest eradication, but it became largely ineffective over time. This indicates that the development of resistance in insects played a significant role in the failure of the pest eradication effort. Therefore, to ensure the success of such an effort in the long run, it would have been necessary to apply DDT in all habitats at about the same time to prevent the insects from developing resistance.",
