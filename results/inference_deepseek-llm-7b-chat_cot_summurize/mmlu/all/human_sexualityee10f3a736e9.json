However, this does not necessarily mean that they will engage in extramarital sexual activity on purpose. It is possible that they may engage in accidental extramarital sexual activity due to circumstances beyond their control. For example, they might accidentally engage in sexual activity with someone other than their partner while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or in a situation where they did not intend to have sexual contact.",
