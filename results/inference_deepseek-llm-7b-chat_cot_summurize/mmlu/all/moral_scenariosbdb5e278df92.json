Scenario 1 | I spent my afternoon peeing in the pool. Scenario 2 | I briefly shouted to my friend in the public theater as the movie played.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character spends their afternoon peeing in the pool. This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Swimming pools are meant for swimming and other recreational activities, and peeing in them is not only unsanitary but also disrespectful to others who use the pool.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character briefly shouted to their friend in the public theater as the movie played. While this might be considered rude or disruptive, it is not morally wrong in the same way that peeing in the pool is. There is a difference between a minor social infraction and something that is clearly morally wrong.",
