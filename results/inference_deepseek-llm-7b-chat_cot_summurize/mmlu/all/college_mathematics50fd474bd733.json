Which of the following must also be divisible by 11?\n\nA. 4x + 6y\nB. x + y + 5\nC. 9x + 4y\nD. 4x - 9y\n\nassistant:To determine which of the options must be divisible by 11, we need to find the possible values of x and y that satisfy 3x + 7y is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of x and y:\n\nCase 1: x = 3a, y = 7b (a, b are positive integers)\nIn this case, 3x + 7y = 3(3a) + 7(7b) = 9a + 21b.\n\nWe want to find if this expression is divisible by 11. To do this, we can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that a number is divisible by 11 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 11.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the digits is 9a + 21b. Since a and b are positive integers, we can find the smallest possible values of a and b such that 9a + 21b is divisible by 11.\n\nThe smallest values of a and b that satisfy this condition are a = 1 and b = 2.\n\nSo, 9(1) + 21(2) = 18 + 42 = 60, which is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, we can check which option will also be divisible by 11:\n\nA. 4x + 6y = 4(3a) + 6(7b) = 12a + 42b = 12(1) + 42(2) = 12 + 84 = 96\n96 is divisible by 11, so option A must be divisible by 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
