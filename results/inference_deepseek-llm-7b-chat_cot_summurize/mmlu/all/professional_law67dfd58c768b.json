The officers broke into the man's home and found the stash of cocaine in the defendant's bedroom. The defendant's argument that the warrant did not name him specifically is not valid, as the warrant is specific in identifying the address of the man who is alleged to be dealing cocaine. The warrant also did not require the officers to search only the man's residence, but rather allowed them to search the dwelling for narcotics. Therefore, the defendant's motion should be denied, as the warrant was valid and issued with probable cause.",
