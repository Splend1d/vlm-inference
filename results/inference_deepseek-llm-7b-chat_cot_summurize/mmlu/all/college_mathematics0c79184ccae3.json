What is the probability that 2(x + y) > 1?\n\nA. 0\nB. 1/4\nC. sqrt(2)/4\nD. 1/sqrt(2)\n\nassistant:We can rewrite the inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 as 0 < x^2 + y^2 < 1. Then, we want to find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1. This can be rewritten as 2(x^2 + y^2) > 1. Solving this inequality gives us x^2 + y^2 > 1/2.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of x^2 + y^2 being greater than 1/2. Using the inequality x^2 + y^2 < 1, we can rewrite it as x^2 + y^2 - 1/2 < 0. Solving this inequality gives us the region inside the circle centered at the origin with radius 1/2.\n\nThe probability we are looking for is the ratio of the area of this circle to the area of the region described by the inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1. The area of the circle is \u03c0(1/2)^2 = \u03c0/4, and the area of the region is 1. Therefore, the probability is \u03c0/4.\n\nHowever, the options given do not include \u03c0/4.
