Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia\n\nassistant:Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or repetitive muscle contractions, causing abnormal postures or repetitive movements. Among the options provided, only writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia.\n\nA.
