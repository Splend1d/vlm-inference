Most of the horses die except for the heaviest males and heaviest females of the group. They survive, reproduce, and perpetuate the population. Since weight is highly heritable and the distribution of weights approximates a binomial distribution, the offspring of the next generation would be expected to have\n\nA. a higher mean weight compared with their parents\nB. a lower mean weight compared with their parents\nC. the same mean weight as members of the original population\nD. a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. a higher mean weight compared with their parents.\n\nThis is because the heaviest males and heaviest females of the group survived the volcanic eruption and reproduced, passing on their heavier weight to their offspring. Over time, this will result in a population with an overall higher mean weight compared to the original population.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the offspring would not necessarily have a lower mean weight than their parents, as the heaviest individuals survived and reproduced.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the mean weight of the offspring would not be the same as the mean weight of the original population, as the heaviest individuals survived and reproduced, resulting in a population with a higher mean weight.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that the mean weight of the offspring would be higher than the mean weight of members of the original population, but this is not necessarily the case as the heaviest individuals survived and reproduced, resulting in a population with a higher mean weight than the original population, not necessarily higher than members of the original population.",
