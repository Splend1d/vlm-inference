The difference between combatants and noncombatants is a matter of degree.\n\nIn the text provided, Valls discusses discrimination in war, implying that there is some differentiation between combatants and noncombatants. However, Valls does not explicitly state that the difference between these two groups is categorical and clear, as option C suggests. Instead, Valls suggests that the difference between combatants and noncombatants is a matter of degree, which aligns with option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Valls does not argue that there is no difference between combatants and noncombatants. Instead, he discusses the discrimination that combatants face, suggesting that there is a difference between them and noncombatants.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is not directly related to the discussion of discrimination in war that Valls is addressing. The focus of Valls' discussion is on the differentiation between combatants and noncombatants, rather than the definition of \"terrorism.\"",
