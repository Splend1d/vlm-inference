The supraorbital foramen, infraorbital foramen, and mental foramen are all bony structures that can be palpated in a live patient. The supraorbital foramen is located above the orbital rim, the infraorbital foramen is located below the orbital rim, and the mental foramen is located in the midline of the face, just in front of the zygomatic arch. These foramina allow nerves and blood vessels to pass through the bone and exit the skull.",
