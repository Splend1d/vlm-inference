Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character takes away their daughter's phone because the daughter's grades are poor. While this may be seen as an overreaction by some, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character eats all the candy that their mother bought for their sister. This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as stealing is generally considered to be a wrong action.",
