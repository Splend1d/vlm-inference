The Monroe Doctrine\nB. Containment\nC. Manifest Destiny\nD. The ideology of states' rights\n\nassistant:The theme of Beveridge's speech can most directly be compared to the ideology of Manifest Destiny. In the speech, Beveridge emphasizes America's ability to govern and expand its dominion, drawing comparisons between various countries and territories that America has governed in the past. He also emphasizes the idea that America is continuing the march of the flag westward and southward, which is a key aspect of the Manifest Destiny ideology. This ideology held that it was God's will for the United States to expand its territory westward across North America until it reached the Pacific Ocean, and southward into what is now Mexico. Therefore, the theme of Beveridge's speech most directly aligns with the ideology of Manifest Destiny.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
