No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.\n\nThe court should not grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law. The issue of whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact that should be left to the jury to decide. The company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's unduly risky behavior, and the man did not cross-examine the witness who testified about the man's behavior being unduly risky. However, whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question that requires a fact-specific determination based on all the evidence presented at trial. Therefore, the court should deny the motion for judgment as a matter of law and allow the jury to decide this issue.",
