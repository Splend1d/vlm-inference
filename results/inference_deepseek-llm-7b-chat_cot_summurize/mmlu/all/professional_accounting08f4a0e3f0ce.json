Johnson also received, as a fringe benefit, group termlife insurance at twice Johnson\u2019s salary. The annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000. What amount must Johnson include in gross income?\n\nA. $100,000\nB. $100,276\nC. $100,414\nD. $100,552\n\nassistant:To determine the amount Johnson must include in gross income, we need to calculate the value of the group term life insurance benefit he received as a fringe benefit.\n\nStep 1: Determine the value of the group term life insurance benefit.\nThe annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000.\nJohnson's salary is $100,000, so the value of the group term life insurance benefit is:\n2.76 \\* (2 \\* Johnson's salary)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the value of the group term life insurance benefit.\n2.76 \\* (2 \\* 100,000) = 2.76 \\* 200,000 = $552,000\n\nStep 3: Add the value of the group term life insurance benefit to Johnson's salary.\nJohnson's salary + Value of group term life insurance benefit = Gross income\n$100,000 + $552,000 = $652,000\n\nSo, Johnson must include $652,000 in gross income. The correct answer is D. $100,552.",
