S\nB. Fe\nC. W\nD. Ag\n\nassistant:To determine the electronegativity of each element, I will look up their values in the periodic table.\n\n- S: Sulfur is in group 16 (VIA) and has an electronegativity of 2.53.\n- Fe: Iron is in group 8 (IIIA) and has an electronegativity of 1.90.\n- W: Tungsten is in group 6 (IIIA) and has an electronegativity of 1.98.\n- Ag: Silver is in group 11 (VA) and has an electronegativity of 1.96.\n\nComparing the electronegativity values, W has the highest electronegativity (1.98), followed by Ag (1.96), Tungsten (1.98), and Iron (1.90). Therefore, the answer is W.",
