The main disadvantage of this organization is that\n\nA. it does not allow simultaneous access to the intended data and its tag\nB. it is more expensive than other types of cache organizations\nC. the cache hit ratio is degraded if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache\nD. its access time is greater than that of other cache organizations\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The main disadvantage of direct mapping of a cache is that the cache hit ratio is degraded if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache.\n\nExplanation: Direct mapping is a simple organization where each block in the cache is mapped to a specific location in main memory. This means that if two or more blocks are mapped to the same location in the cache, they cannot be accessed simultaneously. This reduces the cache hit ratio, as some blocks will always be evicted when another block is accessed.\n\nOption A is not a disadvantage of direct mapping. In fact, direct mapping allows simultaneous access to the intended data and its tag, as each block has a unique tag.\n\nOption B is not a disadvantage of direct mapping. In general, direct mapping is considered to be one of the least expensive cache organizations, as it requires only a simple mapping between the cache and main memory.\n\nOption D is not a disadvantage of direct mapping. Access time for direct mapping is generally the same as for other cache organizations, as it depends on the access pattern and not on the cache organization itself.",
