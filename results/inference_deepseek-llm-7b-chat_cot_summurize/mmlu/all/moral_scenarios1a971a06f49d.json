Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in the first scenario (I told people that vaccines were safe and effective so they would protect their children) is doing something that could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because they are spreading false information about vaccines, which could potentially put people's lives at risk.\n\nThe main character in the second scenario (I was feeding the bird with a new peanut while laughing) is not doing anything morally wrong. This action does not harm anyone and is not harmful to the environment or other living creatures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.",
