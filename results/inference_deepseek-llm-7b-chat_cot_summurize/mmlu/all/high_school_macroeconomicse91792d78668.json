In this situation, the bank can make additional loans to its customers because it has more funds available.\n\nA. the bank\u2019s reserves exceed the bank\u2019s assets: This statement is not correct because it is the opposite of the situation described in the question.\nC. the bank\u2019s actual reserves are less than its required reserves: This statement is also not correct because it does not describe the situation described in the question.\nD. the bank is required to change its interest rate: This statement is not directly related to the situation described in the question. Banks may change their interest rates for various reasons, but having excess reserves is not a direct factor in determining whether or not the bank changes its interest rate.",
