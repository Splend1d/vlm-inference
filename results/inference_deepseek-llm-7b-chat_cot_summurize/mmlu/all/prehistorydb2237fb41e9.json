The evidence for their existence can be traced back to this time frame. The earliest known modern human fossils, such as the Omo remains from Ethiopia, date back around 195,000 years ago, while the oldest known modern human culture, the Acheulean stone tool tradition, dates back around 1.7 million years ago.",
