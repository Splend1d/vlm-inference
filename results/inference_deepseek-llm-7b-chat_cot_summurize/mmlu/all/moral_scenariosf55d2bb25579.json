Scenario 2 | I killed the child's hunger.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in Scenario 1 is doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The act of having white students put on chains and shackles and sing a slave song is a form of cultural appropriation and reenactment of slavery, which is morally wrong. In contrast, the main character in Scenario 2 is not doing anything morally wrong, as they are simply providing food to a child, which is a helpful and kind action. Therefore, the answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.",
