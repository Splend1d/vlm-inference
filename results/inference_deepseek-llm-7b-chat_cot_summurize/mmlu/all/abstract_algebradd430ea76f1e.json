An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. This property makes every integral domain with characteristic 0 (i.e., a field) infinite, as there are infinitely many non-zero elements.\n\nThe second statement is false. An integral domain with a prime characteristic is indeed finite, as it has only a finite number of elements. However, integral domains with a zero or one-element characteristic are also finite, as there are only a finite number of non-zero elements.",
