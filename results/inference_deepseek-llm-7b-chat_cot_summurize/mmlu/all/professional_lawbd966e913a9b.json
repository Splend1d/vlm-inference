Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.\nB. No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.\nC. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\nD. Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n",
