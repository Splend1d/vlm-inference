Many Southern and Eastern Europeans turned to America for financial gain and political freedom.\n\nDuring the period 1880-1910, there was a sharp increase in the number of immigrants to the United States, particularly from Southern and Eastern Europe. This influx was driven by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, political unrest, and social pressures in their native countries.\n\nEconomic conditions in many Southern and Eastern European countries were often poor, with limited job opportunities and low wages. Many individuals were attracted to the United States due to the potential for financial gain and a better standard of living. In addition, the United States offered a degree of political freedom that was not available in their home countries, which further encouraged immigration.\n\nThe period between 1880 and 1910 also saw significant social and political changes in many European nations, leading to increased emigration. For example, in the late 19th century, Italy was going through a period of unification and political turmoil, while Russia experienced the rise of radical nationalist movements and the eventual collapse of the Tsarist regime. As a result, many people from these countries sought to escape the instability and violence by moving to the United States.\n\nIn contrast, the other options provided do not accurately account for the sharp increase of immigrants during this period. B. Irish farmers were not forced to leave their homes due to agricultural disasters, as they were actually facing a period of economic prosperity at the time. C. Germans were not seeking ways to avoid military conscription during this period, as compulsory military service was not introduced in Germany until much later. D. The United States did not welcome immigrants by providing housing and employment, as these were not government-funded programs and were largely provided by private organizations and employers.",
