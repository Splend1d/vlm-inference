It creates an enforceable contract with delivery of 500 widgets in February and delivery of 500 widgets in March.\n\nThe distributor's fax on January 31 accepted the manufacturer's offer of 1,000 widgets at $10 each for February delivery. However, it also modified the offer by reducing the quantity to 500 widgets in February and 500 widgets in March. This fax constitutes a modification of the original offer, but it does not constitute a counteroffer because it does not contain different terms from those contained in the original offer.\n\nSince the manufacturer did not respond to the distributor's fax, it is possible that the manufacturer did not agree to the modification. However, the distributor's fax accepted the original offer, and the modification is a further clarification of the terms of the contract. Therefore, the contract is enforceable, and the manufacturer is obligated to deliver 500 widgets in February and 500 widgets in March.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. It creates an enforceable contract with delivery of 500 widgets in February and delivery of 500 widgets in March.",
