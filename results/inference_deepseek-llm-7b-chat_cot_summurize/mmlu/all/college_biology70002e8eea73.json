DNase I specifically targets and breaks the phosphodiester bonds that hold together the nucleotide bases in DNA. When DNase I comes into contact with DNA, it cleaves the DNA at specific sequences called cleavage sites. These cleavage sites are found in the linker DNA between the nucleosome cores.\n\nThe nucleosome is a repeating unit of DNA and histones in eukaryotic cells. It consists of a DNA molecule wrapped around an octamer of histones, with the core histones being H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The linker DNA connects the nucleosome core to the rest of the DNA. When DNase I comes into contact with a nucleosome dimer, it breaks the linker DNA between the nucleosome cores, causing the nucleosome dimer to break apart into two nucleosome monomers.\n\nTherefore, the target of digestion of a nucleosome dimer to nucleosome monomers by DNase is histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
