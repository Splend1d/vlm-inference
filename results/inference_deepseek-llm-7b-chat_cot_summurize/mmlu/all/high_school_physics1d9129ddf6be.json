According to this principle, the electric field below the plane is the vector sum of the electric fields due to the charges on the plane and the electric field due to the charges above the plane.\n\nLet's denote the electric field due to the charges on the plane as E_plane and the electric field due to the charges above the plane as E_above. The electric field due to the charges on the plane is given by E_plane = \u03c3/(2*\u03b5\u2080*height), where height is the distance between the plane and the point below the plane.\n\nThe electric field due to the charges above the plane is given by E_above = \u03c3/(2*\u03b5\u2080*height).\n\nThe electric field below the plane is then given by the vector sum of E_plane and E_above: E_below = E_plane + E_above.\n\nSince both E_plane and E_above are equal to \u03c3/(2*\u03b5\u2080*height), we can simplify the expression for E_below as follows:\n\nE_below = (\u03c3/(2*\u03b5\u2080*height)) + (\u03c3/(2*\u03b5\u2080*height)) = (2\u03c3/(2*\u03b5\u2080*height)) = \u03c3/(\u03b5\u2080*height).\n\nThe magnitude of E_below is given by:\n\n|E_below| = |\u03c3/(\u03b5\u2080*height)| = |\u03c3/(\u03b5\u2080*height)| = |\u03c3/(\u03b5\u2080)| = |\u03c3|/|\u03b5\u2080| = \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080.\n\nThe direction of E_below is the vector sum of the electric field due to the charges on the plane and the electric field due to the charges above the plane. Since both electric fields are in the same direction, the direction of E_below is the same as the direction of E_above, which is given by the answer option B.",
