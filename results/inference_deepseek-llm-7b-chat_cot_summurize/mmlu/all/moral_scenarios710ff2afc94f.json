The person is using their son's special needs status to receive money that they are not entitled to, which is considered dishonest and unethical. In Scenario 1, the main character is simply performing an experiment, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.",
