Kantian theory\nD. an ethics of prima facie duty\n\nassistant:Nathan is most likely applying Kantian theory. According to Kantianism, humans have an inherent moral duty to treat all rational beings with respect and dignity, regardless of whether they possess moral standing. In this case, Nathan is arguing that failing to protect the environment involves a deficiency in one's moral character, which aligns with Kantian principles.",
