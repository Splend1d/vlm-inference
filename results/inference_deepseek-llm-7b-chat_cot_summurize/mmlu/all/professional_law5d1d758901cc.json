The prosecution immediately objected to this question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the husband's attorney is not impeaching a prior witness, but rather a prior statement made by the same witness.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no mention of a foundation being laid.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the rule in many jurisdictions is that a prior inconsistent statement of a witness may be used to impeach that witness, unless the court otherwise orders.\n\nOption D is the correct answer. The physician's testimony at the coroner's inquest would be more recent and thus more reliable than her testimony at the trial. The trial judge should rule that this question is unobjectionable because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.",
