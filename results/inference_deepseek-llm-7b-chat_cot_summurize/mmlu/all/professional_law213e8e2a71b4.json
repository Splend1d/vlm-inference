At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n\nassistant:The witness's testimony is admissible only to the extent that it addresses the engineer's reputation. According to Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to attack or support their credibility. However, evidence of other acts is admissible for a limited purpose, such as to prove a person's conduct or character in relation to a non-violent or non-sexual offense. In this case, the witness's testimony about the engineer's neighbors describing him as a truthful person could be admissible to show that the engineer has a good reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, the witness's opinion about the engineer's character, stating that the engineer is a truthful person, would likely be inadmissible under Rule 401. This is because the opinion of a witness is not considered to be \"other evidence of character or reputation\" under Rule 401.\n\nIn conclusion, the portion of the witness's testimony that addresses the engineer's reputation, as described by his neighbors, may be admissible, while the opinion of the witness about the engineer's character would likely be inadmissible. Therefore, the answer is B. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.",
