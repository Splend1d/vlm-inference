The integral of the polar curve r = ln \u03b8 is given by the integral of the function d\u03b8/dt, where t is the parametric variable and r is the polar coordinate.\n\nThe integral of d\u03b8/dt is given by:\n\n\u222b(1/t) dt\n\nwhere t is the parametric variable and r is the polar coordinate.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nLet's first evaluate the antiderivative of 1/t:\n\n\u222b(1/t) dt = (ln|t|) + C\n\nNow, let's evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\n(ln|\u03c0|) - (ln|2\u03c0|) = (ln|\u03c0|) - (ln|2\u03c0|) - C\n\nNow, let's solve for the constant C:\n\nC = ln|2\u03c0| - (ln|\u03c0|)\n\nNow, let's find the area:\n\nArea = (ln|\u03c0|) - (ln|2\u03c0|) - (ln|\u03c0|) + (ln|2\u03c0|)\n\nArea = 2(ln|\u03c0|) - (ln|\u03c0|) - (ln|\u03c0|) + (ln|2\u03c0|)\n\nArea = (2ln|\u03c0| - 2)\n\nArea \u2248 2.931\n\nThe area bounded by the spiral r = ln \u03b8 on the interval \u03c0 <= \u03b8 <= 2\u03c0 is approximately 2.931.
