If four players are to be selected at random, the expected value of the random variable W, the total combined weight of the four players, is 992 pounds. The standard deviation of Wis approximately\n\nA. 47 pounds\nB. 67 pounds\nC. 94 pounds\nD. 141 pounds\n\nassistant:This problem is a problem of sampling from a normal distribution. To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the expected value and variance of a sum of independent random variables.\n\nThe expected value of W, the total combined weight of the four players, is given as 992 pounds. Let x, y, z, and w represent the weights of the four players. The expected value of W is:\n\nE(W) = x \\* E(y) + y \\* E(z) + z \\* E(w) + w \\* E(y) - w \\* E(z) - w \\* E(w) - w \\* E(y) + w \\* E(z) + w \\* w \\* E(y) - 2w \\* E(z) + w \\* E(w)\n\nPlugging in the given average weight and standard deviation, we get:\n\nE(W) = 248 \\* 248 + 248 \\* 248 + 248 \\* 248 + 248 \\* 248 - 47 \\* 47 - 47 \\* 47 - 47 \\* 47 + 47 \\* 47 - 47 \\* 47 - 47 \\* 47 - 47 \\* 47 + 47 \\* 47 - 2 \\* 47 + 47 \\* 47\n\nSolving for E(W), we get:\n\nE(W) = 992\n\nNow, let's calculate the variance of W. The variance of W is given by:\n\nVar(W) = E(W^2) - (E(W))^2\n\nWe need to calculate E(W^2) and plug it into the formula.\n\nE(W^2) = E(x^2) + E(y^2) + E(z^2) + E(w^2) + 2 \\* E(x \\* y) + 2 \\* E(x \\* z) + 2 \\* E(x \\* w) + 2 \\* E(y \\* z) + 2 \\* E(y \\* w) + 2 \\* E(z \\* w)\n\nPlugging in the given average weights, we get:\n\nE(W^2) = (248)^2 + (248)^2 + (248)^2 + (248)^2 + 2 \\* 248 \\* 248 + 2 \\* 248 \\* 248 + 2 \\* 248 \\* 248 + 2 \\* 248 \\* 248 + 2 \\* 248 \\* 248 + 2 \\* 248 \\* 248\n\nSolving for E(W^2), we get:\n\nE(W^2) = 706176\n\nNow, plug E(W^2) into the variance formula:\n\nVar(W) = 706176 - (992)^2\n\nSolving for Var(W), we get:\n\nVar(W) = 141 pounds\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of W is approximately 141 pounds.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 141 pounds.",
