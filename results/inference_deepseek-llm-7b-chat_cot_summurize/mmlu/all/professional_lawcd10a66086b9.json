The man, because under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the gardener's part performance was evidence of his intent to honor the entire contract.\n\nassistant:C. The man, because the gardener's part performance necessarily implied an acceptance and a promise that he would render complete performance.\n\nThe gardener did not accept the man's offer because he never verbally agreed to the terms of the contract. When the man offered to pay $50 if the gardener mowed the lawn by Saturday, the gardener did not agree to these terms. Instead, the gardener promised to mow the lawn by Saturday but did not specify the payment amount. Therefore, the gardener never accepted the man's offer.\n\nOn the other hand, the man's part performance implied an acceptance of the gardener's offer. When the man saw the gardener mowing the lawn, he knew that the gardener was performing the agreed-upon service. This performance constituted an acceptance of the contract, and the man was obligated to pay the gardener for the half-completed job.\n\nThe gardener's note about finishing the job on Monday did not affect the man's obligation to pay for the half-completed job. The man had already accepted the gardener's performance as complete, and the note did not change the terms of the contract. Therefore, the man is likely to prevail in a suit against the gardener for breach of contract.\n\nA. The gardener, because he never accepted the offer made by the man, is incorrect because the gardener did not agree to the terms of the contract, but the man's part performance implied an acceptance.\n\nB. The gardener, because he offered to cure the defective performance by finishing the job on Monday morning, is incorrect because the man had already accepted the gardener's performance as complete, and the note did not change the terms of the contract.\n\nD. The man, because under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the gardener's part performance was evidence of his intent to honor the entire contract, is incorrect because equitable estoppel does not apply in this case. The man's part performance did not imply an acceptance of the entire contract, but only the part that had already been completed.",
