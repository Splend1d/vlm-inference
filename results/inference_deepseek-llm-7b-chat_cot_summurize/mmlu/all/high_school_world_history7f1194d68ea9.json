Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family.\n\nIn the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., women's lives were generally more restricted than women's lives had been globally before the advent of sedentary societies. One of the ways in which women's lives were more restricted was that they were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family. This was due to the fact that sedentary societies, which typically included farming communities, were largely patriarchal and focused on the male breadwinner model. Women were often confined to the domestic sphere and were expected to take on the role of homemakers and caregivers for the family.\n\nThis was in contrast to pre-sedentary societies, where women had more opportunities to participate in the economy and society. In these societies, women had more freedom to pursue activities such as hunting, gathering, and trading, and they were not as restricted by the constraints of the domestic sphere.\n\nMoreover, in sedentary societies, women's power fell within the private sphere. They were expected to maintain a virtuous and submissive demeanor, and they were often subjected to social and cultural norms that limited their mobility and opportunities for personal growth. This was in stark contrast to pre-sedentary societies where women had more autonomy and could exercise their power and influence in various ways.\n\nIn summary, the advent of sedentary societies in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. led to a significant decline in women's power and opportunities for personal growth. Women were increasingly confined to the domestic sphere and were expected to take on the role of primary earners for the family. This was a significant departure from pre-sedentary societies where women had more opportunities to participate in the economy and society, and their power was not as constrained by social and cultural norms.",
