On this basis, we can conclude that the army-figures industry is most likely a(n)\n\nA. increasing-cost industry\nB. constant-cost industry\nC. decreasing-cost industry\nD. profit-making industry\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's break down the information given and analyze it step by step.\n\n1. The industry makes plastic army figures.\n2. It uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that the demand for the raw materials (plastic) required for this industry is quite high. Since the industry uses only a small fraction of the total demand for plastic, it means that the cost of the raw materials used in this industry is relatively low.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Increasing-cost industry: This industry would require a high demand for raw materials and a high cost, which contradicts the information provided.\n\nB. Constant-cost industry: This industry would require a stable demand for raw materials and a constant cost, which also contradicts the information provided.\n\nC. Decreasing-cost industry: This industry would require a decreasing demand for raw materials and a decreasing cost, which contradicts the information provided.\n\nD. Profit-making industry: This industry would require a stable demand for raw materials and a profit, which doesn't contradict the information provided.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is D. Profit-making industry. The army-figures industry, which uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes, is likely a profit-making industry since it has a low cost for the raw materials required.",
