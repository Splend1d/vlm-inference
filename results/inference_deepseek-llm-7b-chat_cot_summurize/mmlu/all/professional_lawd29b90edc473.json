The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n\nThe two men agreed to burglarize a home, which constitutes a conspiracy. The alarm specialist provided the men with the knowledge on how to disarm the alarm system, which also amounts to conspiracy. Since the men abandoned their planned burglary due to the presence of the guard dog, they were not able to complete the act, and thus, it would be considered attempted burglary.\n\nTherefore, all three parties are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary.",
