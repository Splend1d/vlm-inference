When the string is raised to an angle of 50 degrees below the horizontal (the ceiling) and released, the ball swings back and forth with a period of 0.4 s. Which of the following changes to the pendulum would decrease the period of the pendulum?\n\nA. Increasing the mass of the ball\nB. Decreasing the length of the string\nC. Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released\nD. Decreasing the mass of the ball\n\nassistant:C. Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released\n\nThe period of a pendulum is inversely proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum and proportional to the sine of the angle at which it is released. Since the period of the given pendulum is 0.4 seconds, we can write the equation as:\n\nT = (2\u03c0\u221aL)sin(\u03b1)\n\nwhere T is the period, L is the length of the pendulum, \u03b1 is the angle at which it is released, and \u03c0 is a constant (approximately 3.14159).\n\nIf we want to decrease the period of the pendulum, we need to decrease the sine of the angle at which it is released. This can be achieved by decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released. By doing so, the pendulum will have to swing further to complete one period, thereby decreasing the period of the pendulum.",
