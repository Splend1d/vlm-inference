Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased.\n\nThis law was passed to protect the voting rights of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. The act requires that states with a history of voting discrimination undergo \"preclearance\" before making any changes to their voting laws, ensuring that changes do not disproportionately harm minority voters. This has led to an increase in voting participation for racial minority voters, which is the correct answer.",
