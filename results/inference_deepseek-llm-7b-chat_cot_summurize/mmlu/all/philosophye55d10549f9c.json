This idea is central to his philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of accepting and transforming one's circumstances rather than trying to change them.\n\nEpictetus believed that people should not focus on external things, such as their possessions or relationships, as these are not under their control. Instead, they should focus on how they respond to these things, which is under their control. This idea is reflected in his statement: \"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning them.\"\n\nIn this context, Epictetus's statement about the only thing one can call one's own refers to the ability to control one's reactions and responses to the impressions or events that occur in one's life. This is a central theme in his philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of living in accordance with reason and virtue rather than being ruled by external circumstances.",
