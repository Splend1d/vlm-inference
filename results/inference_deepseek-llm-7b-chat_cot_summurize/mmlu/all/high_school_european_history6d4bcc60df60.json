The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century\n\nThe report mentions that the inhabitants of the area are desperate for food due to the famine. They resort to eating mice, roots, and even rotten food to survive. The agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century could have helped to alleviate the hunger problem by increasing food yields and allowing for more efficient farming practices. The elimination of the Black Plague and the creation of a strong putting-out system would not necessarily have a direct impact on the hunger issue mentioned in the report. A declining population during the seventeenth century might have had some effect on food yields, but it is not stated in the passage, and it is not clear whether this decline would have led to less hunger or better food distribution.",
