The sophisticated stone tool making industry at the Pinnacle Point site in South Africa is evidence of a 250,000-year-old tradition of hand axe production and use. This site is known for its well-preserved evidence of early stone tool technology, including the production and use of hand axes. These tools were used for a variety of purposes, such as cutting, scraping, and chopping, and were essential for the early humans who lived at this site.",
