Decreasing both government spending and taxes\n\nassistant:B. Increasing government spending and decreasing taxes is the most expansionary fiscal policy action. This is because increasing government spending increases aggregate demand in the economy, while decreasing taxes reduces the amount of taxes that households and businesses have to pay, which increases their disposable income and spending. This combination of actions can lead to an increase in economic growth and inflation.",
