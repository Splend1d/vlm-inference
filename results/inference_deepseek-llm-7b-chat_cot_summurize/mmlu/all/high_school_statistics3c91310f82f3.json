A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery\nB. An unnecessary stoppage of the production process\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings\nD. Continued production of proper size ball bearings\n\nassistant:A Type II error would occur if the null hypothesis is not rejected even though the ball bearings' mean diameter is actually over 1.27 centimeters. In this case, the machinery would continue to produce ball bearings with a diameter greater than 1.25 centimeters, which is not the desired size. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings",
