The first event was an earthquake, which caused significant damage to the city of Knossos and other Minoan settlements. The earthquake likely led to the collapse of some of the buildings, disrupted trade routes, and disrupted the economy. The second event was a volcanic eruption, which covered the Minoan settlements with ash and disrupted the local environment. This eruption likely had a profound impact on the Minoan people, who were forced to adapt to new conditions and find new ways to survive.",
