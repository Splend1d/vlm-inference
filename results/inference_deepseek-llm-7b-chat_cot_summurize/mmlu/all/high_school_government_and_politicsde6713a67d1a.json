Registered voters between the ages of 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than are those under the age of 21. This statement is accurate, as older adults tend to vote at higher rates than younger adults.\n\nB. A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout. This statement is accurate as well, as education is often correlated with voting behavior.\n\nC. Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than they are in primary elections. This statement is also accurate, as general elections tend to have higher voter turnout than primary elections.\n\nD. More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980. This statement is NOT accurate. While there is a general trend of higher female voter turnout, there have been instances where male voter turnout surpassed female voter turnout, such as in the 2004 presidential election.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
