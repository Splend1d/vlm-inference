A higher proportion of older women have completed menopause\nB. A smaller proportion of older women report dreams about sex\nC. A higher proportion of older men are bald\nD. A higher proportion of older men and women are victims of cancer\n\nassistant:A higher proportion of older women have completed menopause is more likely to be a cohort, rather than an age, difference. This is because menopause is a specific event that occurs at a certain age, typically around 51 years old, for most women. Therefore, it is more likely to be a cohort, as it is a group of people who share a particular characteristic (menopause) that happened at a certain time (age of 51).\n\nOn the other hand, the other options (B, C, and D) are more likely to be age differences. B and C involve characteristics that are not necessarily age-related, while D involves a disease that can affect people of any age. Therefore, they are not as likely to be cohorts.",
