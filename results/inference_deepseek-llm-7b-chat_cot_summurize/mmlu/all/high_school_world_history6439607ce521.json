This is evident in the contrasting behavior of Christians and Muslims towards hermits and Christian merchants. While Christians show kindness and hospitality towards Muslim hermits, who are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God, Muslims do not hinder or stop Christian merchants in their territories. This suggests that Muslims were less committed to religious obligations and more focused on economic factors during the crusading era.",
