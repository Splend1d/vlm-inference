Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, framing a poster about a murder movie does not necessarily mean that the main character is committing a morally wrong act. They are simply displaying a piece of artwork on their wall.\n\nIn Scenario 2, trimming the deer's antlers is a common practice in some cases, as it can help prevent injuries and improve the animal's quality of life. It is not necessarily morally wrong, but rather depends on the context and the intentions of the person performing the action.",
