Which of the following is the approximate interquartile range for this distribution?\n\nA. 25.00 \u2013 22.30 = 2.70\nB. 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40\nC. 27.70 \ufffd 22.30 = 1.24\nD. 2.00(4.00) = 8.00\n\nassistant:To find the interquartile range (IQR), we need to first find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the distribution. \n\nThe Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data. Since X is normally distributed, we can find Q1 by taking the median of the lower half of the data, which is the average of the 25th percentile (the value below which 25% of the data falls) and the 75th percentile (the value below which 75% of the data falls).\n\nQ1 = (25th percentile + 75th percentile) / 2\nQ1 = (25 + 75) / 2\nQ1 = (100) / 2\nQ1 = 50\n\nThe Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data. Since X is normally distributed, we can find Q3 by taking the median of the upper half of the data, which is the average of the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile.\n\nQ3 = (25th percentile + 25th percentile) / 2\nQ3 = (25 + 25) / 2\nQ3 = (50) / 2\nQ3 = 25\n\nNow, we can find the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\nIQR = 25 - 50\nIQR = -25\n\nSince the IQR is negative, it means that the lower half of the data is shifted to the left of the upper half. This is not a normal distribution, as it deviates from the standard bell-shaped curve.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the provided values are rounded or incorrect, so let's check the options:\n\nA. 25.00 \u2013 22.30 = 2.70\nB. 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40\nC. 27.70 \ufffd 22.30 = 1.24\nD. 2.00(4.00) = 8.00\n\nNone of the options match the calculated IQR of -25. Therefore, we can conclude that the given distribution is not normally distributed, and the interquartile range cannot be determined with the provided information.",
