Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.\n\nKant's view of sexual objectification is that it reduces a person to a mere object of sexual desire, which he considers a violation of their humanity. Papadaki, on the other hand, argues that this view is incorrect. She may believe that sexual objectification does not necessarily sacrifice a person's humanity, or that it can be done in a way that enhances it.",
