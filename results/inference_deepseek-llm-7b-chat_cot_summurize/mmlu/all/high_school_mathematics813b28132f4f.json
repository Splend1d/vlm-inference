This occurs when the derivative of the function is equal to zero.\n\nThe derivative of sin(3\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8 is:\nd/d\u03b8 (sin(3\u03b8)) = (3cos(3\u03b8))/3 = cos(3\u03b8)\n\nNow, we need to find the \u03b8 value where cos(3\u03b8) = 0.\n\ncos(3\u03b8) = 0\n3\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0n or 3\u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0n, where n is an integer.\n\nFor the first quadrant, we can use the first equation:\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0n\n\nNow, we need to find the integer n such that the resulting angle is in the first quadrant.\n\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + 2\u03c0(-1)\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 - \u03c0\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/3\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding value of r:\nr = sin(3\u03b8)\nr = sin(3(\u03c0/3))\nr = sin(\u03c0) = 0\n\nThe point where the rose has a vertical tangent in the first quadrant is (0, 0). However, none of the given options match this value. Therefore, the answer is A. nowhere.",
