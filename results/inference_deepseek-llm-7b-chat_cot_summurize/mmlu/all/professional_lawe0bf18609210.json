The defendant had only an eighth-grade education and no legal knowledge. At a pretrial hearing, the defendant told the judge that he was unhappy with the public defender who had been appointed to represent him and that he wanted the judge to appoint another lawyer. The judge refused to appoint another lawyer, telling the defendant, with no further explanation, that his only other choice was to represent himself. The defendant said that he would represent himself at trial then, as \"anything [was] better than having this lawyer.\" The defendant did not raise the subject again, and he represented himself at trial.

Yes, because the defendant was not capable of effectively representing himself.\nD. Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n\nassistant:The defendant's request for a new trial should be granted. The appellate court should recognize that the defendant's right to counsel was violated by the trial court's refusal to appoint another lawyer and the defendant's lack of legal knowledge and education. This denial of the right to counsel and the defendant's inability to effectively represent himself should have a significant impact on the outcome of the trial, and thus, the error was not harmless.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.",
