This means that if a person has been acquitted of a crime or if a conviction has been overturned on appeal, they cannot be tried again for that same crime at the state level.\n\nHowever, if the state level prosecution was unsuccessful, it may be possible to try the defendant again at the federal level, as long as the federal charges are not the same as the state charges. This is because the \"double jeopardy\" provision only applies to state prosecutions, and does not apply to federal prosecutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. under the \"double jeopardy\" provision of the Constitution.",
