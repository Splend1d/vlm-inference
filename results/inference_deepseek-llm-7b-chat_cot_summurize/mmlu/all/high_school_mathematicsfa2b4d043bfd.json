Find $a+b+c$.\n\nA. 16\nB. 6\nC. 12\nD. 150\n\nassistant:We can use the AM-GM inequality to solve this problem. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:\n\n$(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) \\ge 3\\sqrt[3]{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(ab + ac + bc)}$\n\nSince $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, we know that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is a positive integer. Therefore, the right side of the inequality is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to $3$. This means that the left side of the inequality is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to $150$.\n\nWe can rewrite the left side of the inequality as $(a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)$. Since $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, we know that $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$ is a positive integer, and $(ab + ac + bc)$ is a positive integer. Therefore, the left side of the inequality is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to $150$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 150.",
