A particular trial requires that, out of a jury of 12, at least three are women. If a jury of 12 is to be selected at random from the pool, what is the probability it meets the requirements of this trial?\n\nA. 0.168\nB. 0.843\nC. 0.915\nD. The answer cannot be determined without knowing the size of the jury pool.\n\nassistant:To determine the probability, we first need to calculate the number of potential jurors in the pool. The question states that 30 percent of the potential jurors are women, so we can calculate the number of women as follows:\n\nNumber of women = 0.3 \\* Total number of potential jurors\n\nThe question does not provide the total number of potential jurors, so we cannot determine the probability without this information. Therefore, the answer is D: The answer cannot be determined without knowing the size of the jury pool.",
