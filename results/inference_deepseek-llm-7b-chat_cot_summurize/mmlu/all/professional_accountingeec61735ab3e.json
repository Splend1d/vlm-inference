The players have a unit variable cost of $160. The company estimates that it will sell one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold. Home entertainment systems have a unit variable cost of $460 and sell for $600 per unit. The company's fixed costs are $90000. Assuming that the sales mix estimate is correct how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even?\n\nA. 300\nB. 500\nC. 1200\nD. 1500\n\nassistant:To find out how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even, we need to calculate the total revenue, total costs, and the break-even point in terms of DVD players.\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue:\nSince the company sells one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold, the total revenue from selling DVD players can be represented as 4 * DVD_player_revenue.\n\n2. Calculate the total costs:\nThe total cost of selling DVD players can be represented as the sum of the unit variable cost of DVD players and the fixed costs: 4 * (DVD_player_revenue * DVD_player_unit_cost) + fixed_costs.\n\n3. Calculate the break-even point in terms of DVD players:\nTo find the number of DVD players needed to break even, we need to set the total revenue equal to the total costs:\n4 * DVD_player_revenue * DVD_player_unit_cost + fixed_costs = 4 * DVD_player_revenue * (DVD_player_revenue * DVD_player_unit_cost - DVD_player_unit_cost) + fixed_costs.\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n4 * DVD_player_revenue * (DVD_player_revenue - 1) * DVD_player_unit_cost + fixed_costs = 0.\n\nRearranging the equation:\n4 * DVD_player_revenue * (DVD_player_revenue - 1) * DVD_player_unit_cost = -fixed_costs.\n\nDividing both sides by 4 * DVD_player_unit_cost:\n(DVD_player_revenue - 1) = -(fixed_costs / (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost)).\n\n4. Solve for the number of DVD players needed to break even:\nTo find the number of DVD players needed to break even, we need to solve the equation for DVD_player_revenue:\nDVD_player_revenue - 1 = -(fixed_costs / (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost))\nDVD_player_revenue = 1 + fixed_costs / (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost)\n\nSince we know that DVD_player_revenue = fixed_costs / (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost), we can substitute this into the equation:\nfixed_costs / (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost) - 1 = 0\n\nRearranging the equation:\nfixed_costs / (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost) = 1\n\nDividing both sides by (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost):\nfixed_costs = 1 * (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost)\n\nFixed_costs = 4 * DVD_player_unit_cost\n\nNow we can find the number of DVD players needed to break even:\nfixed_costs = DVD_player_revenue * DVD_player_unit_cost\n\nfixed_costs = (4 * DVD_player_revenue * DVD_player_unit_cost) / (4 * DVD_player_unit_cost)\n\nfixed_costs = DVD_player_revenue\n\nNow we can substitute this into the equation:\nDVD_player_revenue = fixed_costs\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nSolving for DVD_player_revenue:\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\nDVD_player_revenue = $90000\n\n",
