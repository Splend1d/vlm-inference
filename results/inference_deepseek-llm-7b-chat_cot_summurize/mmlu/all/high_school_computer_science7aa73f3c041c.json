When a number is odd, its remainder when divided by 2 is 1. Therefore, the condition <MISSING CONDITION> should be whether the number is even or odd.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nA. (num MOD 1) = 0 is true for any number, both even and odd, so it doesn't determine whether the number is odd or even.\nB. (num MOD 1) = 1 is true for odd numbers only, so it would only display \"odd\" for odd numbers, not even numbers.\nD. (num MOD 2) = 1 is true for even numbers only, so it would only display \"odd\" for even numbers, not odd numbers.",
