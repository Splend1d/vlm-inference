Gunpowder weapons\nB. The compass\nC. Steel\nD. Germ Theory\n\nassistant:The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in 1494, and it was a result of the need to divide the newly discovered lands in the Atlantic Ocean between the Portuguese and the Spanish. The technology that most directly caused this treaty to be signed is the compass.\n\nThe compass, which is a navigational tool that helps sailors determine their direction, played a crucial role in the exploration of the new world. The Portuguese and the Spanish were competing with each other to explore and claim new lands in the Atlantic Ocean. The compass made it possible for the Europeans to navigate across the vast Atlantic Ocean and discover new lands.\n\nThe other options, such as gunpowder weapons, steel, and germ theory, did not have a direct cause-and-effect relationship with the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas. While gunpowder weapons and steel were used in the exploration and conquest of new lands, they were not the primary reason for the treaty. The germ theory was not even discovered during this time period.\n\nIn conclusion, the most direct cause of the Treaty of Tordesillas was the compass, which allowed for efficient navigation and exploration of the Atlantic Ocean, leading to the need for a division of newly discovered lands between the Portuguese and the Spanish.",
