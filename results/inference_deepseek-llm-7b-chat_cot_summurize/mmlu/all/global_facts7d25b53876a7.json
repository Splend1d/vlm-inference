However, I can try to help you find the answer to your question.\n\nYou can try searching for the information you need by using a search engine like Google or Bing. You can also try searching for the information on government or non-profit websites that focus on issues related to bullying and youth.\n\nAlternatively, you may be able to find the information you need in a report or study on the topic. These reports and studies may be available on the websites of organizations that conduct research on bullying, such as the National Center for Educational Statistics or the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nI hope this helps!
