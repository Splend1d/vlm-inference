Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character takes both of their children by their hands and runs away from a burning house. This action could be seen as morally wrong because they are putting their own safety above that of their children, and potentially endangering them in the process.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tries to impress Taylor Swift by learning how to write songs. While this may not be the best way to impress her, it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
