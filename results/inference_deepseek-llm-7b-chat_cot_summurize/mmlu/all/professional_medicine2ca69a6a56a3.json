The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy.

Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg.

This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Atrial fibrillation\nB. Cor pulmonale\nC. Systemic hypertension\nD. Tricuspid valve regurgitation\n\nassistant:The patient's medical history includes pneumonia at age 3 years, and he has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces, which suggests a potential cardiac abnormality. The symptoms of weak femoral and brachial pulses, as well as a radiofemoral delay, are also consistent with a cardiac condition. The chest x-ray shows mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, and the ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nGiven these findings, the patient is at greatest risk for complications related to his cardiac condition. The most likely complication is cor pulmonale, which is a condition that occurs when the right ventricle of the heart becomes enlarged and weak due to increased workload. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and ultimately, congestive heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is also a potential complication, but it is less likely given the current presentation. Systemic hypertension and tricuspid valve regurgitation are less likely complications in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Cor pulmonale.",
