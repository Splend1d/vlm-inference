An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\nA. P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nB. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nC. P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\nD. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n\nassistant:To find the P-value, we can use the t-distribution with 6 degrees of freedom. The value of t is 1.54. Using the t-distribution table or calculator, we find the P-value to be approximately 0.1714.\n\nNow, we have to choose the correct option from the given choices. \n\nA. P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nB. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\nC. P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\nD. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n\nThe correct option is B. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.\n\nThe P-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the P-value is the probability of obtaining a t-score greater than 1.54 or more extreme, assuming the manufacturer's claim is true. The P-value is the area of the tail of the t-distribution that is to the right of 1.54 and up to infinity.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.",
