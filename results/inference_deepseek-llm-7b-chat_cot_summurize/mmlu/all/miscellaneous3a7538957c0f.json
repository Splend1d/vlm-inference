The first measurement is 1.4 cm, the second measurement is 1.2 cm, and the third measurement is 0.9 cm. The true length is greater than the first measurement, the second measurement, and the third measurement. This means that the measurements are not precise, but they are accurate because they are close to the true length. Therefore, the statement that is true is:\n\nB. They are precise but not accurate.",
