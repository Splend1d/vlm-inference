This is because most state laws that discriminate against illegitimate children have been invalidated to ensure that a state's concern over illicit relationships is not the basis for punitive measures against the product of such a relationship. This is the correct answer (A).\n\nOther answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. This answer suggests that the illegitimate son has been deprived of property without due process, which is not necessarily the case here. The issue is not about the illegitimate son being deprived of property, but rather about his right to inherit from his father's estate.\n\nC. This answer argues that the state may promote the just and expeditious disposition of property at death by denying intestate succession to all illegitimate children. While this may be a legitimate state interest, it does not necessarily invalidate the state statute. The issue here is not about the expeditious disposition of property, but rather about the illegitimate son's right to inherit from his father's estate.\n\nD. This answer suggests that discrimination against illegitimate children is not suspect and, therefore, the law does not violate the equal protection clause if it is substantially related to a legitimate state interest. While this may be true, it does not necessarily invalidate the state statute in this specific case. The issue here is not about whether the discrimination is suspect, but rather about the illegitimate son's right to inherit from his father's estate.",
