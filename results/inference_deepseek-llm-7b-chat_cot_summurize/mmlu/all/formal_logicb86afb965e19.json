A \u2283 (~B \u2228 C)\n- If A is true, then (~B \u2228 C) must be either true (if ~B is false or C is true) or false (if both ~B and C are false).\n- If A is false, then (~B \u2228 C) can be either true or false.\n\n2. C \u2283 D\n- If C is true, then D must be either true (if C is true and D is true) or false (if C is true and D is false).\n- If C is false, then D can be either true or false.\n\n3. A \u2228 (B \u00b7 ~D)\n- If A is true, then (B \u00b7 ~D) must be either true (if B is true and ~D is false) or false (if either B is false or ~D is true).\n- If A is false, then (B \u00b7 ~D) can be either true or false.\n\n4. A \u2261 (B \u2283 D)\n- If A is true, then (B \u2283 D) must be either true (if B is true and D is true) or false (if B is false or D is false).\n- If A is false, then (B \u2283 D) can be either true or false.\n\nNow, let's consider the truth values for A, B, C, and D. We will use the following truth values:\n\nA = true\nB = false\nC = false\nD = false\n\nWith these truth values, we can evaluate the propositions:\n\n1. A \u2283 (~B \u2228 C)\n- (~B \u2228 C) is true (since B is false and C is false, ~B is true and ~C is true)\n- A is true\n- Therefore, A \u2283 (~B \u2228 C) is true\n\n2. C \u2283 D\n- C is false, so D can be either true or false\n\n3. A \u2228 (B \u00b7 ~D)\n- A is true, so (B \u00b7 ~D) can be either true or false\n\n4. A \u2261 (B \u2283 D)\n- A is true, so (B \u2283 D) can be either true or false\n\nSince there are consistent valuations for the given truth values, the set of propositions is consistent. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false",
