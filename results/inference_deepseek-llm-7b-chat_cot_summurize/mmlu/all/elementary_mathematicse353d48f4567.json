At this rate, how much would it cost Sam to buy 12 stamps?\n\nA. $2.19 \nB. $2.28 \nC. $3.72 \nD. $5.52\n\nassistant:To find the cost of 12 stamps, we can set up a proportion. We know that Sam paid $8.28 for 18 stamps, so the cost of 1 stamp is $8.28 / 18 = $0.45. Therefore, the cost of 12 stamps would be 12 * $0.45 = $5.40. Since we are looking for the closest answer, we can round $5.40 to the nearest whole number, which is $5.52. Therefore, the cost of 12 stamps would be $5.52. The correct answer is D.",
