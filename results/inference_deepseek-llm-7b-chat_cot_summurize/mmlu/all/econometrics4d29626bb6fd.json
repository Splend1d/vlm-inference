(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nassistant:The standardised residuals are often assumed to be normally distributed, which corresponds to statement (i). The squares of the standardised residuals are related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate, which corresponds to statement (ii). However, in practice, standardised residuals are often found to have heavy tails, which corresponds to statement (iii). Finally, if the GARCH model is adequate, the standardised residuals and the raw residuals should be identical, which corresponds to statement (iv). Therefore, the correct answer is D.
