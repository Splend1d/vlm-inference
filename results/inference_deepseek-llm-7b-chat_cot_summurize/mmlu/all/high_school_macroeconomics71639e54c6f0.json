Banks must hold required reserves in a variety of forms, such as cash on hand, deposits with the central bank, and other eligible assets. These reserves can be used by banks to make loans or buy investments, and they can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the FED. However, they must be used to make loans or fulfill other reserve requirements, and they must be kept in a bank's vault or its account at the FED.",
