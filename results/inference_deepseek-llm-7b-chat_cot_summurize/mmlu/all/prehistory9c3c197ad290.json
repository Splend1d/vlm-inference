Burials contain bones indicating that people were segregated based on gender, stature, and personal capabilities, including artistic abilities.\n\nThis option suggests that people were differentiated based on their roles and abilities in society, which is evidence of social stratification and inequality. Options A and B are not necessarily indicative of social stratification and inequality, as they only describe the presence of exotic grave goods, which could be a result of social stratification rather than its cause. Option C is also not indicative of social stratification and inequality, as it describes an equal distribution of grave goods, which may not reflect inequality.",
