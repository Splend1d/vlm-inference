Induced dipole < dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond\nB. Hydrogen bond < dipole-dipole < induced dipole\nC. Induced dipole < hydrogen bond < dipole-dipole\nD. Dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond < induced dipole\n\nassistant:The correct order of intermolecular attractive forces from strongest to weakest is:\n\nA. Induced dipole < dipole-dipole < hydrogen bond\n\nThis means that the induced dipole-dipole force is weaker than both the hydrogen bond and the dipole-dipole force. The induced dipole-dipole force is weaker because it is a temporary force that arises from the temporary alignment of the dipoles due to an external electric field. The hydrogen bond, on the other hand, is a stronger intermolecular force because it involves the sharing of electrons between atoms, which leads to the formation of a covalent-like bond. The dipole-dipole force is a permanent force that arises from the permanent dipoles between molecules.",
