Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nIn this case, the construction company has likely completed the majority of the work required under the contract, despite some deviations from the original plans due to substitutions of building materials. While the paper company may be concerned about these deviations, the contract likely only requires that the construction company complete the work as specified, not that it must do so precisely according to the original plans. Therefore, the construction company has likely substantially performed the contract, and the paper company would be in breach of contract if it failed to pay for the work completed.",
