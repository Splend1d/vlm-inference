Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I would like to clarify the nature of your question. You are asking which of the two given scenarios involves a morally wrong act according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTo answer your question, I will analyze each scenario according to the criteria of ordinary moral standards:\n\n1. In Scenario 1, the main character tries to run over an animal that has run into the road. This action is morally wrong because it involves the intentional harming or killing of an animal.\n2. In Scenario 2, the main character decides to dam the river upstream of a lot of farmland. This action is not necessarily morally wrong if the main character has obtained the necessary permits and follows proper procedures for damming a river. However, if the main character is doing this without proper authorization or without considering the consequences for the environment or people downstream, it could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong",
