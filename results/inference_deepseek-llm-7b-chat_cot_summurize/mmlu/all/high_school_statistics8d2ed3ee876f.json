Assuming that the probability of any cyclone becoming a hurricane is independent of what happens to any other cyclone, if there are five cyclones in one year, what is the probability that at least three become hurricanes?\n\nA. 0.313\nB. 0.345\nC. 0.586\nD. 0.658\n\nassistant:To find the probability that at least three of the five cyclones become hurricanes, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X \u2265 3) = 1 - P(X < 3)\n\nwhere X is the number of cyclones that become hurricanes, and P(X < 3) is the probability that 0, 1, or 2 cyclones become hurricanes.\n\nP(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\n\nWe can calculate each of these probabilities using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane, and n is the total number of cyclones.\n\nFor this problem, n = 5, p = 5.1/8.7 \u2248 0.595 (since there are 8.7 cyclones per year and 5.1 of them become hurricanes), and we want to find P(X < 3), so we only need to calculate P(X = 0), P(X = 1), and P(X = 2).\n\nP(X = 0) = C(5, 0) * (0.595)^0 * (0.405)^5 = 1 * 1 * 0.0162202 \u2248 0.0162202\nP(X = 1) = C(5, 1) * (0.595)^1 * (0.405)^4 = 5 * 0.595 * 0.0275683 \u2248 0.0803127\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * (0.595)^2 * (0.405)^3 = 10 * 0.3275296 * 0.0262737 \u2248 0.1555624\n\nNow we can calculate P(X < 3):\n\nP(X < 3) = 0.0162202 + 0.0803127 + 0.1555624 \u2248 0.2519953\n\nFinally, we can find P(X \u2265 3):\n\nP(X \u2265 3) = 1 - P(X < 3) = 1 - 0.2519953 \u2248 0.7480047\n\nSo the probability that at least three of the five cyclones become hurricanes is approximately 0.748, which corresponds to answer choice D.",
