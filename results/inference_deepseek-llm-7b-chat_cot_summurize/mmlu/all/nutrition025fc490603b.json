The mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA only contains information for the protein to be synthesized.\n\nExplanation:\nA. This statement is incorrect because not all the information in DNA codes for proteins. Some of the information is used for regulation and other functions.\nC. This statement is partially correct. In eukaryotes, only one strand of DNA is transcribed to form mRNA, but then the mRNA is copied from the template strand to the coding strand using a process called splicing.\nD. This statement is incorrect because the RNA formed by transcription of DNA does not undergo splicing. Instead, introns are removed from the RNA before it becomes mRNA.",
