According to Aquinas, the ultimate goal of human existence is to attain happiness, which he believed to be the fulfillment of human nature and the fulfillment of our potential as human beings.\n\nAquinas believed that the ultimate happiness of man is achieved through two main avenues: acts of the moral virtues and loving God. He argued that the moral virtues, such as courage, wisdom, justice, and temperance, are essential for the flourishing of human life and the realization of happiness. By practicing the moral virtues, individuals can cultivate their virtues and become more fully human.\n\nIn addition to acts of the moral virtues, Aquinas believed that the ultimate happiness of man is also achieved through loving God. He argued that the love of God is the ultimate end of human existence and is the source of all true happiness. By loving God, individuals can attain a deep sense of fulfillment and joy, and can experience a sense of union with the divine.\n\nTherefore, according to Aquinas, man's ultimate happiness consists in acts of the moral virtues (B) and loving God (C).",
