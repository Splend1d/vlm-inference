Bacon's Rebellion in colonial Virginia.\n\nThe events described in the passage are about the Quakers' support for the Native Americans and their resistance to the government's actions against them. This is in line with Bacon's Rebellion, which was a protest against the government's policies in colonial Virginia, particularly taxes and land distribution. The other options do not have the same connection to the events described in the passage. The expulsion of Anne Hutchinson was a matter of religious disagreement in Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Boston Tea Party was a protest against taxes and trade policies in Massachusetts, and the trial of John Peter Zenger was a case of press freedom in colonial New York.",
