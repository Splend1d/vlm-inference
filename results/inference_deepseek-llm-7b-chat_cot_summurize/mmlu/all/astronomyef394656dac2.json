What is the mass and weight of this sand bag on a planet with half the gravity compared to Earth?\n\nA. Mass 5kg weight 100N\nB. Mass 5kg weight 50N\nC. Mass 5kg weight 25N\nD. Mass 10kg weight 100N\n\nassistant:To calculate the mass and weight of the sand bag on a planet with half the gravity compared to Earth, we need to know the mass and weight of the sand bag on Earth.\n\nLet's assume that the mass of the sand bag on Earth is 5kg and its weight is 50N.\n\nOn a planet with half the gravity compared to Earth, the weight would be reduced by half. To find the weight on the new planet, we can multiply the weight on Earth by the gravity ratio:\n\n50N * (1/2) = 25N\n\nNow, to find the mass of the sand bag on the new planet, we can use the weight as the gravitational force and divide by the acceleration due to gravity on the new planet. Let's assume the new planet's gravity is half that of Earth's gravity.\n\n25N / (2 * 9.8 m/s\u00b2) = 25N / 19.6 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 1.26 kg\n\nNow, we can compare the mass and weight of the sand bag on the new planet to the options provided:\n\nA. Mass 5kg weight 100N\nB. Mass 5kg weight 50N\nC. Mass 5kg weight 25N\nD. Mass 10kg weight 100N\n\nThe answer is B. Mass 5kg weight 50N",
