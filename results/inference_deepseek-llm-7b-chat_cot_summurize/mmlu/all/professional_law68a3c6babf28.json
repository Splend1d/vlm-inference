However, if the farmer is found to have been negligent in leaving the fire unattended, the neighbor may have a stronger case for recovery. If the farmer is strictly liable for the spread of the fire, the neighbor may also have a case for recovery. If the fire was caused by an act of God that was unforeseeable, the farmer may not be liable. Ultimately, the outcome of the claim would depend on the specific facts and applicable laws in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred.",
