Which of the following protocols would probably not result in a change in the enzyme\u2019s efficiency?\n\nA. Bringing the temperature of the experimental setup from 20\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C\nB. Adding an acidic solution to the setup\nC. Adding substrate but not enzyme\nD. Placing the substrate and enzyme in a container with double the capacity\n\nassistant:Imagine a student is trying to find out how well an enzyme works. They do some experiments to see how changing different things might affect the enzyme.\n\nOption A is like making the room where the experiment happens very hot. This might not change the enzyme's efficiency because enzymes work best in a certain temperature range, and going too high or too low might not make the enzyme work better or worse.\n\nOption B is like adding something that's not very friendly to the enzyme. Enzymes usually work better with things that are not too acidic or too basic. So, adding something that's too acidic might not change the enzyme's efficiency.\n\nOption C is like putting a piece of food (the substrate) in the experiment without putting the enzyme. The enzyme needs the substrate to work, so without it, the enzyme might not change the efficiency of the substrate.\n\nOption D is like putting more room for the enzyme and substrate to work, but that doesn't change the efficiency of the enzyme itself.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A because changing the temperature doesn't usually affect the efficiency of enzymes.",
