The set() function returns a new set object which is a collection of unordered, unique elements.\n\nGiven the list l = [1,2,2,3,4], we can convert it into a set using the set() function as follows:\n\n```python\nl = [1,2,2,3,4]\ns = set(l)\nprint(s)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the output:\n\n```\n{1, 2, 3, 4}\n```\n\nComparing the output with the given options:\n\nA. {1}\nB. {1,2,2,3,4}\nC. {1,2,3,4}\nD. {4,3,2,2,1}\n\nThe output {1, 2, 3, 4} is the correct answer. Therefore, the possible output of set(l) is option C.",
