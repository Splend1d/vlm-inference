Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.\n\nIn this case, the grandfather's son had a duty to warn the grandfather about the potential hazard of toys being left on the floor, as the son had been aware of the grandson's habit of leaving toys scattered about the house. The grandfather was a regular visitor to the son's home and had no reason to expect that the son would not warn him about the potential danger.\n\nThe grandfather's injury was caused by the son's failure to warn about the risk of the toys being left on the floor, and the grandfather should be entitled to recover damages for his injuries. Therefore, the court should grant the grandfather's motion for judgment as a matter of law as to liability.",
