It is a dwarf galaxy, meaning it is smaller and less massive than the Milky Way. The LMC orbits the Milky Way in a clockwise direction, and it is visible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Large Magellanic Cloud is not a planetary nebula. A planetary nebula is a type of object that is formed when a star runs out of fuel and expels its outer layers. Option C is incorrect because the Large Magellanic Cloud is not a bright star cluster discovered by Magellan. Finally, option D is incorrect because the Large Magellanic Cloud is not the outer arm of the Milky Way named after Magellan.",
