The right\n\nA. Is absolute.\nB. Is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock.\nC. Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.\nD. Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The right to inspect corporate books and records is not absolute, but rather is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder having a proper purpose for the inspection. This means that the shareholder must have a legitimate reason for wanting to examine the records, such as to ensure compliance with securities laws or to investigate potential fraud or misconduct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to inspect corporate books and records is not absolute, but rather is subject to certain conditions and limitations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the value of the stock owned by the shareholder does not determine the right to inspect corporate books and records. Any shareholder, regardless of the value of their stock, has the right to inspect corporate books and records if they have a proper purpose for doing so.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the right to inspect corporate books and records exists regardless of whether fraud or illegality is alleged. Any shareholder, regardless of whether fraud or illegality is involved, has the right to inspect corporate books and records if they have a proper purpose for doing so.",
