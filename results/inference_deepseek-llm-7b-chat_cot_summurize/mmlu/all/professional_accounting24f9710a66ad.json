You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The capital structure of Merritt Co. is 20% common equity and debt equal to 80%. The cost of common equity is 10% and the pretax cost of debt is 5%. Merritt's tax rate is 21%. What is Merritt's weighted-average cost of capital?\n\nA. 5.16%\nB. 6.00%\nC. 6.98%\nD. 7.50%\n\nassistant:To calculate the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), we need to first find the market value of debt and equity. Then, we will multiply each by their respective weights and add them together. Finally, we will multiply the result by the tax rate and divide by the total value of debt and equity.\n\n1. Market value of debt = Total debt \\* (1 - tax rate)\nMarket value of debt = $80,000,000 \\* (1 - 0.21) = $64,000,000\n\n2. Market value of equity = Total equity \\* (1 - tax rate)\nMarket value of equity = $20,000,000 \\* (1 - 0.21) = $15,600,000\n\n3. Market value of debt and equity = Market value of debt + Market value of equity\nMarket value of debt and equity = $64,000,000 + $15,600,000 = $79,600,000\n\n4. Weighted average cost of debt (WACOD) = (Market value of debt / Total debt) \\* (1 - tax rate)\nWACOD = ($64,000,000 / $80,000,000) \\* (1 - 0.21) = 0.81 \\* 0.89 = 0.7129 or 71.29%\n\n5. Weighted average cost of equity (WACOE) = (Market value of equity / Total equity) \\* tax rate\nWACOE = ($15,600,000 / $20,000,000) \\* 0.21 = 0.074 \\* 0.21 = 0.1538 or 15.38%\n\n6. WACC = (WACOD \\* Total debt + WACOE \\* Total equity) / (Total debt + Total equity)\nWACC = (0.7129 \\* $80,000,000 + 0.1538 \\* $20,000,000) / ($80,000,000 + $20,000,000)\nWACC = (0.7129 \\* $80,000,000 + 0.1538 \\* $20,000,000) / $100,000,000\nWACC = (0.57458 \\* $80,000,000 + 0.1538 \\* $20,000,000) / $100,000,000\nWACC = (44.7184 \\* $80,000,000 + 3.0776 \\* $20,000,000) / $100,000,000\nWACC = (356.9144 \\* $80,000,000 + 6.1552 \\* $20,000,000) / $100,000,000\nWACC = (285.53152 \\* $80,000,000 + 6.1552 \\* $20,000,000) / $100,000,000\nWACC = (2284.25 \\* $80,000,000 + 12.3104 \\* $20,000,000) / $100,000,000\nWACC = (2284.25 \\* $80,000,000 + 12.3104 \\* $20,000,000) / $100,000,000\nWACC = 0.1538 or 15.38%\n\nSo the correct answer is C. 6.98%.",
