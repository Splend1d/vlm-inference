If the annual price of capital increases, what will happen to the short-run cost curves?\n\nA. The marginal cost and average variable cost curves will shift upward.\nB. The average fixed cost and average total cost curves will shift upward.\nC. The marginal cost and average fixed cost curves will shift upward.\nD. The marginal cost, average fixed cost, average variable cost, and average total cost curves will all shift upward.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The short-run cost curves will shift upward.\n\nWhen the annual price of capital increases, the cost of capital also increases. This means that the cost of using capital to produce gadgets will increase. As a result, the marginal cost curve, which shows the change in total cost with each additional unit of labor or capital, will shift upward. Similarly, the average variable cost curve, which shows the total cost per unit of output, will also shift upward. This is because the additional cost of capital will be added to the cost of labor and other inputs.\n\nWhile the average fixed cost curve and average total cost curve will also shift upward, the primary effect of the increased price of capital will be on the marginal and average variable cost curves.",
