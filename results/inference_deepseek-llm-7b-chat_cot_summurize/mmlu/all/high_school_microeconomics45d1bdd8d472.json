Therefore, the opportunity cost of studying is the value of the alternative that Nancy has chosen to forego, which is the cost of mowing the lawn ($6) or babysitting her niece ($8). Since the opportunity cost of studying is $14, it is less than the benefit received from studying, which is not given in the question. Therefore, option B is true.",
