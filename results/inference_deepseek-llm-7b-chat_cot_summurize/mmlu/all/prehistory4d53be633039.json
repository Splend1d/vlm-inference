These diseases, such as tuberculosis and smallpox, were likely to have had a significant impact on the megafauna populations, leading to their decline and eventual extinction.\n\nIn addition to the arrival of humans, it is also likely that environmental changes played a role in the extinction of the megafauna. The climate in the Americas may have become cooler and wetter around 13,000 years ago, leading to a decrease in the availability of food sources for the megafauna. This, combined with the impact of human hunting, is thought to have contributed to their decline and eventual extinction.\n\nTherefore, it is most likely that the extinction of Australian and American megafauna was due to both humans and environmental changes.",
