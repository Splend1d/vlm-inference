Submental\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Submental.\n\nIn this case, the patient has a confirmed squamous cell carcinoma on the apex of the tongue. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, including the submental lymph nodes. Therefore, it is important to evaluate these lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis. The other options listed (Inferior deep cervical, Parotid, and Retropharyngeal) are not as closely related to the location of the primary tumor and are therefore less likely to be affected by metastasis.",
