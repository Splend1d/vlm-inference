Mars\nB. Venus\nC. Earth\nD. Mars and Earth\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Mars and Earth.\n\nBoth Mars and Earth have active plate tectonics. Plate tectonics are a series of geological processes that involve the movement of Earth's lithosphere (the outermost layer of the Earth) due to the convection of the mantle. These movements cause the formation of mountain ranges, the creation of new crust, and the movement of oceanic crust, among other things.\n\nPlate tectonics are thought to have first developed on Earth about 2 billion years ago, and they have played a significant role in shaping the planet's surface and geologic history. Over time, Earth's plate tectonics have influenced the formation of many features, including the development of mountains, the creation of sedimentary basins, and the formation of the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nPlate tectonics have also influenced the development of other planets in the solar system, including Mars and Earth. On Mars, plate tectonics have contributed to the formation of the planet's large shield volcanoes and have played a role in shaping the planet's surface. On Earth, plate tectonics have continued to shape the planet's surface and have contributed to the formation of many of the planet's geological features.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Mars and Earth.",
