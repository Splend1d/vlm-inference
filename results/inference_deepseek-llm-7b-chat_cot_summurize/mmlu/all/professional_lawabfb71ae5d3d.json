The investor calls a librarian to authenticate the microfilm copy of a newspaper from that date. This copy, kept in the archives of the public library, is the only record of that particular issue of the newspaper. The microfilm is\n\nA. admissible, to prove the price of gold on that day.\nB. admissible as an ancient document.\nC. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nD. inadmissible as not the best evidence.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. admissible, to prove the price of gold on that day.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect because:\n\nB. Admissible as an ancient document - The document is not necessarily ancient, it's just a microfilm copy of a newspaper from 20 years ago.\n\nC. Admissible as past recollection recorded - This answer is not specific enough and does not explain why the microfilm would be admissible in court.\n\nD. Inadmissible as not the best evidence - The microfilm is not necessarily inadmissible, it could be admissible if it helps prove the price of gold on that specific date, which is relevant to the case.",
