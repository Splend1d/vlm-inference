Costs have been incurred in the development of goodwill.\nB. Goodwill has been created in the purchase of a business.\nC. The company expects a future benefit from the creation of goodwill.\nD. The fair market value of the company\u2019s assets exceeds the book value of the company\u2019s assets.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Goodwill has been created in the purchase of a business.\n\nExplanation: Goodwill is a non-physical asset that arises when the purchase price of a business exceeds the sum of the fair market values of the business's assets and liabilities. It represents the value of the reputation, customer base, and other intangibles that the business possesses. A company should recognize goodwill in its balance sheet at the point when it has been created, which is typically during the acquisition of another business. Options A, C, and D are not relevant to the recognition of goodwill in a company's balance sheet.",
