This is because the more people he surveys, the more accurate his results will be.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate method for Emil would be to survey a group of people standing in line for tickets. This is because people standing in line for tickets are likely to be fans of the game, and therefore more likely to have an opinion on the most popular football team.",
