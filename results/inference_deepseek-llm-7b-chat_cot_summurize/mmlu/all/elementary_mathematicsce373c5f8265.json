They place the school at (0, 0). The nearest store is placed at the point (\u20135, 7). In which quadrant is the point representing the nearest store?\n\nA. Quadrant I\nB. Quadrant II\nC. Quadrant III\nD. Quadrant IV\n\nassistant:The point representing the nearest store is (-5, 7). To determine which quadrant it belongs to, we can use the following rules:\n\n1. If both the x and y values are positive, the point is in the first quadrant.\n2. If both the x and y values are negative, the point is in the fourth quadrant.\n3. If the x value is positive and the y value is negative, the point is in the second quadrant.\n4. If the x value is negative and the y value is positive, the point is in the third quadrant.\n\nApplying these rules to the given point (-5, 7):\n\n- The x value is negative and the y value is positive, so the point is in the third quadrant.\n\nTherefore, the nearest store is in Quadrant III. The answer is C.",
