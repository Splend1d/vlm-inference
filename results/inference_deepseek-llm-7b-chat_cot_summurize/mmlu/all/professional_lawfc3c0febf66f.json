This type of clause is commonly used in contracts to provide a predetermined amount for damages in case of breach of contract, which can help prevent disputes over the actual amount of damages. In this case, the $200 penalty serves as a predetermined amount for the senior citizen's failure to show up for work without giving notice in advance, allowing the school to easily calculate the damages and avoid potential disagreements over the amount.",
