The voltage measured by the voltmeter is 75 V. The limiting error is in percentage\n\nA. 3.33 %.\nB. 2.66 %.\nC. 2 %.\nD. 1 %.\n\nassistant:To find the limiting error, we can use the formula:\n\nlimiting error = (guaranteed error / full scale reading) x 100%\n\nwhere the guaranteed error is 2% of the full scale reading.\n\nThe full scale reading of the voltmeter is 100 V, so the guaranteed error is 2% x 100 V = 2 V.\n\nNow we can calculate the limiting error:\n\nlimiting error = (2 V / 100 V) x 100% = 2%\n\nSo the limiting error is 2%, which corresponds to option C.",
