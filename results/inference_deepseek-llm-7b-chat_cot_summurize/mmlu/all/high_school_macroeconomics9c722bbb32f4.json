First, let's convert the percentages to the same unit (percentages).\n   Nominal income: 4% = 4/100 = 0.04\n   Real income: 1% = 1/100 = 0.01\n\n2. Next, let's calculate the change in nominal income.\n   Nominal income change = 4% (0.04)\n\n3. Now, let's calculate the change in real income.\n   Real income change = -1% (-0.01)\n\n4. Finally, let's calculate the overall change in price level.\n   Overall change = Nominal income change + Real income change\n                  = 0.04 + (-0.01)\n                  = 0.03\n\nSo, the price level changed by 3 percent. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 3 percent increase.",
