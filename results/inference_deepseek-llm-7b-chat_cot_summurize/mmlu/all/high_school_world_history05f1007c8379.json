All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for \"black Africans\"]\n\nThis statement indicates that the Arab slave traders were specifically targeting \"idolatrous Koholanes,\" which can be understood as a reference to black Africans who were practicing a different religion. This suggests that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade, as the traders were hunting down individuals based on their religious beliefs or practices.",
