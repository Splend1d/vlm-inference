How sure can we be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided at that time?\n\nA. 2.4%\nB. 8.0%\nC. 64.0%\nD. 90.4%\n\nassistant:To determine how sure we can be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided at that time, we need to consider the margin of error for the survey.\n\nThe survey had a sample size of 400 registered voters, which is a relatively large sample for a telephone survey. However, it is still subject to sampling error, which means that there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the results.\n\nTo estimate the margin of error for the survey, we can use the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = (Z-score * Standard Deviation) / sqrt(Sample Size)\n\nwhere Z-score is the critical value for the desired confidence level, Standard Deviation is the standard deviation of the population being surveyed, and Sample Size is the number of respondents in the survey.\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is 1.96. Assuming that the population standard deviation is the same as the sample standard deviation, we can calculate the margin of error as follows:\n\nMargin of Error = (1.96 * Standard Deviation) / sqrt(400)\n\nThe standard deviation of the population is not known, but we can assume that it is similar to the sample standard deviation, which is the standard deviation of the reported responses in the survey.\n\nLet's assume the sample standard deviation is 6 percentage points. Then, the margin of error becomes:\n\nMargin of Error = (1.96 * 6) / sqrt(400) \u2248 2.82\n\nNow, we can calculate the range of percentages that we can be 95% sure about:\n\n60% - 68% = 8%\n\nSince the margin of error is 2.82, we can say that the actual percentage of undecided voters is between 60% and 68% with a 95% confidence level. Therefore, we can choose either option B (8.0%) or option C (64.0%).",
