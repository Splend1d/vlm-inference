A 30 milligram ampoule of Codeine Phosphate for injection - This is a controlled drug because it contains Codeine, which is listed under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.\n\nB. A sustained release Morphine tablet - This is a controlled drug because it contains Morphine, which is also listed under the Act.\n\nC. A 12.5 microgram Fentanyl patch - This is a controlled drug because it contains Fentanyl, which is listed under the Act.\n\nD. A 500 ml bottle of Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml in oral suspension - This is a controlled drug because it contains Morphine, which is listed under the Act.\n\nBased on the analysis, all options A, B, C, and D contain controlled drugs and are therefore regulated under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Therefore, none of the options is not a controlled drug.",
