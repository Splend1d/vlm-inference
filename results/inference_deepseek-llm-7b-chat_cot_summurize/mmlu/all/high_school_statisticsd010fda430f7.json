To test this, he designed an experiment in which patients who required this type of surgery were randomly assigned to the standard technique or the new technique. Then the mean recovery time for each treatment group was compared. Assuming conditions for inference were met, which analysis should be used?\n\nA. A t-test for a mean.\nB. A t-test for a difference in means.\nC. A z-test for a mean.\nD. A z-test for a difference in means.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. A t-test for a difference in means. The doctor designed an experiment to compare the mean recovery time between the new surgery technique and the standard technique. Therefore, a t-test for a difference in means is appropriate to determine whether there is a significant difference in the mean recovery time between the two groups.\n\nA t-test for a mean would only be used if we are interested in comparing the means of the two groups, but not whether there is a difference between the means. A z-test for a mean would only be used if we are interested in comparing the means of the two groups, but not whether there is a difference between the means. A z-test for a difference in means would be used if we are interested in comparing the means of the two groups and determining whether there is a significant difference between the means.",
