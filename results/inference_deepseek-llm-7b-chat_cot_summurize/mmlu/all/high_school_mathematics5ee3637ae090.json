Bright is $60 \\%$ more expensive than Fresh and has $25\\%$ less volume than Glow. Glow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright and has $33\\frac{1}{3} \\%$ more volume than Fresh.

What is the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow?\n\nA. 90\nB. 120\nC. 60\nD. 320\n\nassistant:Let's denote the cost of Fresh toothpaste as $x$ dollars. Then, the cost of Bright toothpaste is $1.6x$ dollars, and the cost of Glow toothpaste is $0.75(1.6x) = 1.2x$ dollars.\n\nThe volume of Bright toothpaste is $1 - 0.25 = 0.75$ times the volume of Fresh toothpaste, and the volume of Glow toothpaste is $1 - 0.25 = 0.75$ times the volume of Bright toothpaste. Therefore, the volume of Glow toothpaste is $0.75(0.75) = 0.5625$ times the volume of Fresh toothpaste. Since Fresh toothpaste costs $1.00$ dollars per unit of volume, the cost of Glow toothpaste is $1.2(0.5625) = 0.675$ dollars per unit of volume.\n\nThe number of cents per unit of volume of Glow toothpaste is $0.675 \\times 100 = 67.5$. The closest answer to this value is 68, so the answer is C.",
