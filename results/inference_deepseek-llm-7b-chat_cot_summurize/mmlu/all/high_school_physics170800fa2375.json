Gamma rays\nB. Ultraviolet\nC. Blue light\nD. Orange light\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Orange light.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Gamma rays: These are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, with wavelengths ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers.\n- Ultraviolet: Ultraviolet light has wavelengths between 10 and 400 nanometers, making it shorter than gamma rays but longer than visible light.\n- Blue light: Blue light has wavelengths between 400 and 500 nanometers, making it shorter than orange light but longer than violet light.\n- Orange light: Orange light has wavelengths between 590 and 700 nanometers, making it the longest wavelength of the options.\n\nTherefore, the longest wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is in orange light.",
