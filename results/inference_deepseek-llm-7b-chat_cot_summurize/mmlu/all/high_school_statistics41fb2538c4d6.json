The proportion of \"pro-life\" men is the same as the proportion of \"pro-life\" women. This is because the researchers are comparing the proportion of \"pro-life\" attitudes among both men and women, so they are interested in knowing if there is a difference between the two groups. The other options are not directly related to the comparison being made in the study.",
