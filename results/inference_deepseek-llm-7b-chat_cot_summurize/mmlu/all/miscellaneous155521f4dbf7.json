This act limited the number of immigrants from each country that could enter the United States each year. The act was primarily motivated by concerns about the rapid growth of the U.S. population, particularly in urban areas, and a desire to reduce the influence of ethnic and national groups in the country.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. The act did not suspend further immigration from Latin America.\nB. The act did not make it illegal for employers to hire or recruit undocumented workers.\nC. The act did not promote family unification, enabling close relatives of people already resident in the United States to be admitted.",
