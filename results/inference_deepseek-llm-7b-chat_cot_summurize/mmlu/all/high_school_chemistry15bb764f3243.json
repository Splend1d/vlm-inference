BF3\nB. NH4+\nC. PF5\nD. SF6\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. BF3 (Boron Trifluoride)\n- Boron has a valence electron configuration of [1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u00b3] and it has 5 electrons in its valence shell. Since it is bonded to 3 fluorine atoms, it is sharing its valence electrons with fluorine atoms, thus acquiring 6 electrons in total.\n\nB. NH4+ (Ammonium)\n- Nitrogen has a valence electron configuration of [1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2083] and it has 5 electrons in its valence shell. In ammonium, nitrogen is bonded to 4 hydrogen atoms, which share their electrons with nitrogen. This results in nitrogen acquiring 6 electrons in total, making it more stable.\n\nC. PF5 (Phosphorus Pentafluoride)\n- Phosphorus has a valence electron configuration of [1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u00b3] and it has 5 electrons in its valence shell. In phosphorus pentafluoride, phosphorus is bonded to 5 fluorine atoms, which share their electrons with phosphorus. This results in phosphorus acquiring 6 electrons in total, making it more stable.\n\nD. SF6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride)\n- Sulfur has a valence electron configuration of [1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2074] and it has 6 electrons in its valence shell. In sulfur hexafluoride, sulfur is bonded to 6 fluorine atoms, which share their electrons with sulfur. This results in sulfur acquiring 8 electrons in total, making it more stable.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. NH4+ (Ammonium)",
