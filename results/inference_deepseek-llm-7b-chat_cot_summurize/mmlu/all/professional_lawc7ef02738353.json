For the man who is still alive, because he is the surviving adverse possessor.\nC. For the woman, because the use was changed by the men while they were in possession.\nD. For the woman, because title cannot be claimed by two adverse possessors simultaneously.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. For the man who is still alive, because he is the surviving adverse possessor.\n\nThe two men who moved onto the vacant rural land and built a fishing shack on it were adverse possessors of the land. However, only one of them died intestate last year, leaving a sole heir. Therefore, the surviving adverse possessor is the man who is still alive. The woman has not taken any action to dispossess the men of the land, and the period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Therefore, the court should decide in favor of the man who is still alive and the deceased man's heir.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the men acquired title as tenants in common, not as joint tenants. Answer C is incorrect because the use of the land was not changed by the men while they were in possession. Answer D is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that title cannot be claimed by two adverse possessors simultaneously.",
