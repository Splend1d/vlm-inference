If the toy truck\u2019s mass is double the toy car\u2019s mass, then, compared to the acceleration of the truck, the acceleration of the car during the collision will be\n\nA. double the magnitude and in the same direction\nB. double the magnitude and in the opposite direction\nC. half the magnitude and in the same direction\nD. half the magnitude and in the opposite direction\n\nassistant:Let's denote the mass of the toy car as $m_c$ and the mass of the toy truck as $m_t$. Since the mass of the toy truck is double the mass of the toy car, we have $m_t = 2m_c$.\n\nWhen two objects collide, their acceleration is in opposite directions if their masses are equal and their velocities are parallel, and their accelerations are in the same direction if their masses are unequal and their velocities are parallel. In this case, the velocities of the toy car and the toy truck are parallel since they are moving in opposite directions. Therefore, the acceleration of the toy car is in the opposite direction of the acceleration of the toy truck.\n\nSince the acceleration of the toy truck is double the magnitude of the acceleration of the toy car, the acceleration of the toy car will be half the magnitude of the acceleration of the toy truck. Therefore, the answer is D. half the magnitude and in the opposite direction.",
