The written six-month exclusive- right-to-sell listing agreement provided for the payment of a commission if the home sold.

Yes, the full commission, because the homeowner accepted the cousin's offer to purchase during the listing period.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. No, because the closing occurred after the listing period had expired.\n\nUnder the terms of the listing agreement, the broker was entitled to a commission if the home was sold within the six-month listing period. Since the sale to the cousin occurred one month after the listing period had expired, the broker is not entitled to any payment under the agreement. The fact that the homeowner accepted the offer from his cousin and that the broker did not engage in negotiations with the cousin does not change the outcome, as the sale occurred after the listing period had expired. Therefore, the broker is not entitled to any payment, and the answer is B.",
