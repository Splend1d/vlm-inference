Radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.\nB. The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun.\nC. The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun.\nD. The solar wind electromagnetically \"blows\" the ions directly away from the Sun.\n\nassistant:The plasma (ion) tail of a comet always points away from the Sun because of the conservation of angular momentum.\n\nWhen sunlight reaches the comet's surface, it ionizes the atoms and molecules in the comet's ice and dust. These ions are then accelerated by the solar wind, a stream of charged particles ejected by the Sun. As the ions are accelerated, they gain kinetic energy, which increases their speed.\n\nTo conserve angular momentum, the ions must continue to move in the direction they were originally facing. Since the Sun is at the center of the solar system, the direction the ions were originally facing is toward the Sun. As the ions move away from the Sun, they continue to maintain their angular momentum and point their tails away from the Sun.\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental principle of physics that helps explain why the plasma (ion) tail of a comet always points away from the Sun.",
