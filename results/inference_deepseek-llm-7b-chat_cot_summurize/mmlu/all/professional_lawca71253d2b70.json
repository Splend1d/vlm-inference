This state statute prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. A physician who practices in the state brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state contraceptive statute. The physician attacks the validity of the statute on the grounds that it prevents him from giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients, all of whom are married, whose condition of health might be endangered by child bearing. The plaintiff is likely\n\nA. to have standing.\nB. to have standing jus tertii.\nC. not to have standing.\nD. not to have standing jus tertii.\n\nassistant:The user is asking about the standing of a physician who is challenging a state statute in federal court. Standing refers to the requirement that a party have a sufficient stake in the outcome of a lawsuit to maintain it. In this case, the physician is challenging the statute because it prevents him from providing professional advice to his patients, all of whom are married and whose health might be endangered by childbearing. This means that the physician has a direct and concrete interest in the outcome of the lawsuit, and is therefore likely to have standing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. to have standing.",
