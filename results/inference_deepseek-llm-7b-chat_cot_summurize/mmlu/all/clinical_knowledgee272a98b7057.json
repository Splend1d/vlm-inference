Small, soft toothbrush.\n\nA small, soft toothbrush is the first choice for cleaning the mouth. It is designed to clean and maintain oral hygiene by removing plaque, food particles, and bacteria from teeth and gums. Gloved fingers wrapped in gauze, forceps wrapped in gauze, and foam sticks are not typically used for cleaning the mouth, and their use may not be as effective or safe as using a toothbrush.",
