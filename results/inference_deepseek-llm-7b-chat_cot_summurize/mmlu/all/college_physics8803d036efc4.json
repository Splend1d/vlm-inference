Einstein\u2019s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the\n\nA. work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency\nB. work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength\nC. current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength\nD. potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency\n\nassistant:Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength. This is because the work function of the metal (option B) is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the metal, and the energy of the photons (or light) must be greater than the work function in order for an electron to be emitted. As the wavelength of the light increases, the energy of the photons also decreases, so more photons are required to produce the same amount of energy. This means that the current in the tube will increase linearly with the wavelength.",
