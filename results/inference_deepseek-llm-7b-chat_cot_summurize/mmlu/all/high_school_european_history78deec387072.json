Mercantilism was an economic policy that emphasized the importance of a country accumulating as much wealth as possible through trade and the exploitation of other countries. The conquistadores, such as Cort\u00e9s, were driven by the desire to accumulate wealth and riches through their conquests of new lands and their exploitation of the native populations. They sought to accumulate as much gold and other valuable resources as possible in order to enrich their own countries and establish their own wealth and power. This policy of exploitation and accumulation of wealth was in line with the principles of mercantilism.",
