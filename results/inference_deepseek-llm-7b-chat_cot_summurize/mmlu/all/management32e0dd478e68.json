Limited knowledge and great insight\nB. Limited knowledge but high level of experience\nC. Limited knowledge and uncertainty\nD. Limited knowledge and high risk\n\nassistant:The garbage can model of decision making is based on the assumption that organizations are like garbage cans, with different people bringing in different ideas and opinions. The model assumes that organizations are chaotic and constantly changing, and that decisions are made through a process of negotiation and compromise. It does not necessarily assume that organizations have limited knowledge or experience, but rather that they are open to new ideas and perspectives. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Limited knowledge and great insight.",
