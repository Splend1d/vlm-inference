It is unenforceable, because it was not in writing.\n\nassistant:The legal effect of the employer's promise to pay the bonus to the employee is unenforceable. This is because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration. The employer's promise was made orally, and the employee's actions of negotiating a lucrative contract were not enough to create a legally binding agreement. Without consideration, the promise cannot be enforced by law. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",
