Vale's tax basis in Ball on January 2 year 1 was $60000. Ball did not have unrealized receivables appreciated inventory or properties that had been contributed by its partners. On December 31 year 1 Ball made a $10000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner. The Ball Partnership income tax return reported the following items for year 1: Tax-exempt interest income $80000 Dividend income 12000 What total amount of gross income from Ball should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income?\n\nA. $6,000\nB. $16,000\nC. $36,000\nD. 46000\n\nassistant:To determine the total amount of gross income from Ball that should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. The tax-exempt interest income of $80,000. Since this is tax-exempt, it does not affect the partnership's taxable income.\n2. The $12,000 dividend income. This is a taxable income for the partnership.\n3. The $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution made to each partner. This is also a taxable income for the partnership.\n\nTo calculate the partnership's taxable income, we can subtract the tax-exempt interest income from the dividend income and add the nonliquidating cash distribution:\n\nTaxable income = $12,000 - $80,000 + $10,000 = -$68,000\n\nSince the taxable income is negative, we can assume that the partnership had a net operating loss (NOL) for the year. This means that the partnership can use its NOL to offset its taxable income.\n\nTo calculate Vale's share of the partnership's taxable income, we can multiply Vale's tax basis in Ball by the partnership's NOL:\n\nVale's share of taxable income = $60,000 x $68,000 NOL = $408,000\n\nTo calculate Vale's adjusted gross income, we can subtract the partnership's taxable income from Vale's share of taxable income:\n\nAdjusted gross income = Vale's share of taxable income - Partnership's taxable income = $408,000 - (-$68,000) = $408,000 + $68,000 = $476,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $46,000.",
