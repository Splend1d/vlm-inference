An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\n\nassistant:The strongest constitutional argument against the authority of the statute would be that an administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce. This argument is based on the fact that the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, and that this power has been interpreted to include the power to regulate the activities of individuals and businesses that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. However, the power to regulate is not unlimited, and regulations that are excessively burdensome or arbitrary may be deemed unconstitutional. Therefore, an administrative agency, such as the one created by the statute, would not have the authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.",
