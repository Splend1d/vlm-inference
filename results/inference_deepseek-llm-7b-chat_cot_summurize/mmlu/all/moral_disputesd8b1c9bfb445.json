He believed that there are certain moral principles that are inherent in human nature and that can be discerned by reason alone. The first precept of natural law, also known as the principle of the good, states that it is always morally right to do what is good and morally wrong to do what is evil.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, the good is understood as that which brings about the fulfillment of human nature, which is to seek the greatest good for the greatest number of people. This is in contrast to evil, which is understood as that which brings about harm or suffering to others.\n\nThis principle is foundational to natural law ethics and is closely tied to the idea that human beings have a moral duty to act in a way that promotes the common good. It is also the basis for the idea that certain actions, such as lying or theft, are always morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nOverall, Aquinas's first precept of natural law emphasizes the importance of doing what is good and avoiding what is evil, and serves as a foundation for ethical decision-making.",
