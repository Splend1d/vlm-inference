Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas.\n\nThe poem describes the hardships faced by men in Tang society, particularly those from the Shanxi region. The poem mentions that the Shanxi men, known for their fighting reputation, were rounded up like dogs or chickens, and every male was impressed. This indicates that the government was conscripting a large number of men, and the focus was on having able sons who could fight in the army. There is no mention of the birth of daughters being emphasized, nor is there any mention of shared agricultural work between men and women. The mention of the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions and the frontier garrisons running with blood suggests that traditional gender relations were not reversed during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian.",
