When the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost, it is considered a market failure because it leads to an underproduction of the good. This is because the excess benefit is not captured by the producers, leading to a surplus of the good that is not being utilized efficiently. Therefore, the correct answer is A. the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost.",
