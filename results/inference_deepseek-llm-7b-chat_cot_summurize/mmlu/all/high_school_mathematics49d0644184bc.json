How many ways are there to assign the roles of a play that involve one female lead, one male lead, and three different objects that can be played by either gender?\n\nA. 640\nB. 720\nC. 8\nD. 1920\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula for the number of ways to choose the two leads and the three objects.\n\nNumber of ways to choose the two leads:\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! \\* 2!) = 6 ways\n\nNumber of ways to choose the three objects:\nC(4, 3) = 4! / (3! \\* 1!) = 4 ways\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to choose the leads and the objects:\n6 \\* 4 = 24 ways\n\nHowever, since the three objects can be played by either gender, there's an overcounting. We have to divide by the number of ways to choose the gender for each object:\n24 / 2 = 12 ways\n\nSo, there are 12 ways to assign the roles of the play with one female lead, one male lead, and three different objects that can be played by either gender. The answer is C: 8.",
