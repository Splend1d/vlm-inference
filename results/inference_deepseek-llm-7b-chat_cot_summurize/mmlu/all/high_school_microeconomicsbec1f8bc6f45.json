To raise total revenue, owners should\n\nA. decrease price as demand is elastic.\nB. decrease price as demand is inelastic.\nC. increase price as demand is elastic.\nD. increase price as demand is inelastic.\n\nassistant:A price elasticity of demand (PED) of 3 indicates that a 1% change in price will result in a 3% change in demand. This means that the demand is very sensitive to price changes.\n\nTo maximize total revenue, the small business owners should decrease the price, as a decrease in price will increase demand and, consequently, total revenue. This is because a higher price elasticity of demand (PED) means that the demand is more sensitive to price changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. decrease price as demand is elastic.",
