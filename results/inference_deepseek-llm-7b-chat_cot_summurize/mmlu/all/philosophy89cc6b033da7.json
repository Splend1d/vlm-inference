He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nStevenson does not directly respond to the objection that his theory does not account for the kind of goodness that is objective and is known a priori. Instead, he focuses on the importance of distinguishing between the various senses of \"good\" in order to avoid confusions and inconsistencies. He believes that by doing so, his theory can still be considered a viable approach to understanding goodness.",
