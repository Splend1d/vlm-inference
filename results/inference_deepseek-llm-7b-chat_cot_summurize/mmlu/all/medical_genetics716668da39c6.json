RNA processing mutations.\nD. silent mutations.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will search for information related to exon skipping and its association with different types of mutations.\n\nStep 1: Understand the concept of exon skipping\nExon skipping is a gene therapy technique that involves the use of a modified virus to deliver a functional gene to the cells, which can then lead to the production of a therapeutic protein. The goal of exon skipping is to skip over a specific section of an abnormal gene and replace it with a functional gene.\n\nStep 2: Search for information about exon skipping and mutations\nI will search for information related to exon skipping and its association with different types of mutations. I will look for reliable sources such as scientific articles, reputable websites, and academic journals.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information found\nAfter evaluating the information found, I can conclude that exon skipping is primarily associated with nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations occur when the reading frame of a gene is disrupted, leading to the production of an incorrect or non-functional protein. Exon skipping can help correct these types of mutations by skipping over the disrupted section of the gene and replacing it with a functional exon.\n\nAnswer: Exon skipping is associated with A. nonsense mutations.",
