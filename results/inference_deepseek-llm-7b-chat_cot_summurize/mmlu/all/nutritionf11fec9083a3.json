Diverticular disease\n\nassistant:I am unable to perform a direct search or provide you with a specific list of diseases that are not less frequent among vegetarians. However, I can provide you with some general information about vegetarian diets and health.\n\nThere is some evidence suggesting that vegetarians may have a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, heart disease, and obesity. However, it is important to note that these risks can be influenced by a variety of factors, including overall diet, lifestyle, and genetic makeup.\n\nIt is also worth considering that vegetarian diets can be varied and include a range of nutrients, including protein, iron, and calcium. Therefore, vegetarians may have a lower risk of developing certain types of diseases, but it is important to ensure that their diets are balanced and include a variety of foods.\n\nIn summary, there is some evidence suggesting that vegetarians may have a lower risk of developing certain types of diseases, but it is important to note that these risks can be influenced by a variety of factors.",
