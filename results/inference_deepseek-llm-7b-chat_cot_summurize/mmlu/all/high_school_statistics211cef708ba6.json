Observational study\n\nassistant:To gather the needed data for comparing the AP Statistics exam results for male and female students, the most appropriate technique would be a sample survey.\n\nA sample survey is a statistical method used to collect data from a subset of a larger population. In this case, the subset would be the high school students who took the AP Statistics exam. By collecting data from a sample of students, we can make inferences about the larger population and compare the exam results for male and female students.\n\nA census, experiment, and observational study are not the most appropriate techniques for this task. A census would involve collecting data from the entire population, which is not practical or feasible in this case. An experiment would involve manipulating variables to observe their effects, which is not applicable to comparing exam results. An observational study would involve observing behavior or outcomes without interference, which does not provide information on the exam results.",
