Statement 2| In 2017, COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:D. False, True.\n\nStatement 1 is false. In traditional machine learning, it is not assumed that the train and test sets are independent and identically distributed. This assumption is often made in the field of statistics and has a specific meaning. In traditional machine learning, the assumption is that the training set and test set are randomly and independently sampled from the same distribution.\n\nStatement 2 is true. In 2017, many COCO models were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a large dataset of images annotated with labels, which is commonly used for training machine learning models. Pretraining on ImageNet can help models to learn general features from large amounts of data, which can be useful for recognizing objects in images.",
