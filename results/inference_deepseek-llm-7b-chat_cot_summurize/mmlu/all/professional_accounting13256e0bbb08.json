What is that investment worth if the market discount rate is 5%?\n\nA. $100\nB. $2\nC. $500\nD. $200\n\nassistant:To determine the worth of the investment, we need to use the present value formula:\n\nPV = C / (1 + r)^1\n\nwhere PV is the present value, C is the cash flow, r is the discount rate, and 1 is the number of years.\n\nSince the investment pays out $10 p.a. forever, the cash flow (C) is $10 per year.\n\nUsing the given market discount rate (r) of 5%, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nPV = $10 / (1 + 0.05)^1\n\nPV = $10 / 1.05\n\nPV = $9.52\n\nThe investment is worth approximately $9.52. Since the options given are not an exact match, I would choose the closest option:\n\nD. $200",
