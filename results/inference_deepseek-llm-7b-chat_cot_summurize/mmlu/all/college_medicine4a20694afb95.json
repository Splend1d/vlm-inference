The correct answer is D: glycogen or glucose to pyruvate or acetyl CoA.\n\nDuring glycolysis, one molecule of glucose or glycogen is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, which is then converted into acetyl CoA in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) to generate additional ATP and other energy-carrying molecules.",
