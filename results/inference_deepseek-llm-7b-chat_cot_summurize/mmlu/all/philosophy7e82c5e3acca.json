This is reflected in option A. Augustine believed that there are certain situations where lying is justified, such as when it is done to protect someone's reputation or to spare someone's feelings. However, he also believed that lying can have negative consequences, as stated in option B. Therefore, Augustine did not believe that lying is always permissible, as reflected in option C. Finally, Augustine did not believe that lying is never permissible, as stated in option D.",
