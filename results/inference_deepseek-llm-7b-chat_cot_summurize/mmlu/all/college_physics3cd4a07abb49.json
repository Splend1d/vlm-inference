At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\n\nA. 1 N\nB. 2 N\nC. 3 N\nD. 4 N\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s.\n\n2. Before the force was applied, the box was moving with a speed of 1 m/s. When the force is removed, the net force (applied force - friction force) acting on the box should be equal to the change in velocity (2 m/s - 1 m/s = 1 m/s).\n\n3. Since the friction force is negligible in this problem, the net force applied to the box is equal to its change in velocity.\n\n4. Let F be the magnitude of the applied force. The net force is equal to the applied force, minus the friction force. Since we know that the net force is equal to the change in velocity, we can set up the equation:\n\nF - friction = 1 m/s\n\n5. The friction force is negligible, so the friction term can be ignored:\n\nF = 1 m/s\n\n6. Now, we need to find the value of the applied force. We know that the applied force acted for 5 meters, so we can use the equation:\n\nF * time = distance\n\n7. The time the force was applied is the same as the time it took for the box to travel 5 meters, which is equal to the time it took to travel 2 meters (5 meters - 3 meters).\n\n8. Since the speed of the box was 1 m/s before the force was applied, we can use the equation:\n\nspeed * time = distance\n\n9. Solving for time, we get:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\n10. Plugging in the values:\n\ntime = 5 meters / 1 m/s = 5 seconds\n\n11. Now, we can use the equation we set up earlier:\n\nF = 1 m/s\n\n12. The applied force was constant for 5 seconds, so we can calculate its magnitude:\n\nF = 1 m/s * 5 seconds = 5 N\n\nThe answer is B. 2 N.",
