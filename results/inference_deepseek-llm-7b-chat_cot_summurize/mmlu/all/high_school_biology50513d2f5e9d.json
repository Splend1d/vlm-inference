Oxygen.\n\nDuring the period when life is believed to have begun, the atmosphere on primitive Earth contained abundant amounts of all the other gases listed (B, C, and D), but not oxygen. At that time, oxygen was primarily produced by the action of ultraviolet light on water vapor in the atmosphere. This process, known as photosynthesis, began to produce oxygen only later, around 2.4 billion years ago.",
