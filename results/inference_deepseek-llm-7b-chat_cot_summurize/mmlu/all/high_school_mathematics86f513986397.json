If the three planets are lined up in a ray having the sun as its endpoint, what is the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again?\n\nA. 360\nB. 5400\nC. 900\nD. 1200\n\nassistant:Let's reason about the problem.\n\nFirst, let's find the common multiple of the three numbers. The common multiple of 360, 450, and 540 is 1,260,000. That's the smallest positive number of days that represents the moment when all planets are in the exact same locations again.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive difference between the three planets rotation times. \n\n360 / 540 = 2/3\n450 / 540 = 5/7\n540 / 540 = 1\n\nThe smallest positive difference is 2/3 - 5/7 = (2*7 - 5*3) / (3*7) = (14 - 15) / 21 = -1/21\n\nThis means that the three planets will be in the exact same location after 21 days.\n\nThe smallest positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again is 1,260,000 / 21 = 60,000.\n\nSo the answer is 60,000 days.\n\nThe answer is D. 1200",
