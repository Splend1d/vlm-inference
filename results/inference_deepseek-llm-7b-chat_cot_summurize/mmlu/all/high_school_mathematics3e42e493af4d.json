There are three ways this can happen: he can eat two apples, two oranges, or two bananas. Each of these cases has probability $\\frac{1}{9}$, so the probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{81}$.\n\nThe probability of Joe eating at least two different kinds of fruit is $1 - \\frac{1}{81} = \\frac{78}{81}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{26}{27}$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
