The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n- The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 4, and the value of the 4 in the tens place is 40.\n- The ratio of the two values is indeed 1/10.\n\nB. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n- The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 0.4, and the value of the 4 in the ones place is 4.\n- The ratio of the two values is not 1/10, but rather 0.4/4 = 0.1, which is not true.\n\nC. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n- The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 40, and the value of the 4 in the ones place is 4.\n- The ratio of the two values is indeed 40/4 = 10.\n\nD. The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\n- The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 0.4, and the value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 0.4.\n- The ratio of the two values is not 10, but rather 0.4/0.4 = 1.\n\nNone of the options provide the correct answer. Therefore, none of them are true.",
