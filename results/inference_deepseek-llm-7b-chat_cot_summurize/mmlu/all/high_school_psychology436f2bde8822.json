The somato-sensory cortex is a part of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for processing sensory information from the body, while the cerebellum is located at the bottom of the brain and is responsible for coordination and balance. The medulla is a lower part of the brain that is involved in regulating essential functions such as breathing and heart rate.",
