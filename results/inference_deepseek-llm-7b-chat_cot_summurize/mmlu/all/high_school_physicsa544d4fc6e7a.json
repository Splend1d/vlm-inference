The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The ball changes its shape while falling: This is not a plausible explanation for the difference in the measured and predicted velocities.\n\nC. Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball: While air resistance does affect the motion of the ball, it would not cause a 20% difference between the predicted and measured velocities.\n\nD. The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity: This is not applicable to the situation, as the question does not mention any changes in the acceleration of the ball with its velocity.",
