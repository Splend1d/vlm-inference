It is not necessarily true that what is true in nature must be true about humans, so option C is incorrect. The natural law fallacy is also not the same thing as the post hoc fallacy, which involves drawing conclusions based on the order in which events occur.\n\nOption A is not a fallacy at all, but rather a critique of something that costs very little.\n\nOption B, substituting individual stories for a larger sample when supporting a generalization, is more accurately described as the argument from anecdotal evidence fallacy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",
