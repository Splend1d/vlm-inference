A flock of sheep that had been living there fell into a tomb.\n\nassistant:The royal cemeteries of the Moche were discovered by archaeologists. Archaeologists are people who study the past through the objects and structures left behind by people. They use a variety of methods, including digging, mapping, and analyzing artifacts, to learn more about the past.\n\nThe Moche were an ancient civilization that lived in what is now Peru. They were known for their advanced agriculture, pottery, and art. They also had complex religious beliefs and practices, and the royal cemeteries were likely associated with their religious and political leaders.\n\nThe royal cemeteries were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s by a team of archaeologists led by Oscar Montes. They used a variety of techniques, including aerial photography and ground surveys, to locate the cemeteries. The cemeteries were found to be well-preserved and contained a wealth of artifacts, including pottery, jewelry, and other objects.\n\nThe discovery of the royal cemeteries of the Moche has helped us to learn more about this ancient civilization and their culture. The artifacts found in the cemeteries have provided important insights into the beliefs and practices of the Moche people, as well as their trade relationships with other cultures in the region. The cemeteries are also an important source of information about the development of urbanization and social hierarchy in the region.",
