This type of easement is created by a dominant estate in real property for the benefit of a servient estate, and it runs with the land. In this case, the franchise right extends to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees, and it is further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. easement appurtenant.",
