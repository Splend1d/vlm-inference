These measures help in determining whether a relationship exists between two variables and if the relationship is causal. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. strength of the causal mechanisms: This option refers to the mechanisms by which an exposure causes an outcome, which is not what epidemiological measures of effect assess.\n\nB. strength of the reversibility: This option refers to whether an exposure can reverse an outcome, which is not what epidemiological measures of effect assess.\n\nD. strength of a confounding factor: This option refers to the influence of another variable on the relationship between an exposure and an outcome, which is not what epidemiological measures of effect assess.",
