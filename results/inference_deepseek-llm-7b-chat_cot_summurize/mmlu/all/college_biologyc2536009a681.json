The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.\nB. The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed during the organisms' lifetimes.\nC. The frequencies of each allele in a population's gene pool has remained constant over successive generations.\nD. The frequencies of each allele in an organism's genotype has remained constant within the organism's lifetime.\n\nassistant:A must be true in order for evolution to have occurred. This is because the change in allele frequencies over successive generations is a result of genetic drift, natural selection, mutation, and genetic recombination, which are the processes that drive evolution.\n\nB is not necessarily true. While the frequencies of some alleles may change during an organism's lifetime, this does not necessarily lead to evolution. It is the change in allele frequencies over successive generations that drives evolution.\n\nC is not true. If the frequencies of each allele in a population's gene pool remained constant over successive generations, there would be no change, and therefore no evolution.\n\nD is not true. The frequencies of each allele within an organism's genotype do not necessarily change over the organism's lifetime, and therefore do not necessarily drive evolution.",
