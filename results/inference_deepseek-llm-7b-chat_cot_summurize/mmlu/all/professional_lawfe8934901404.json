As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more.\" On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\nC.
