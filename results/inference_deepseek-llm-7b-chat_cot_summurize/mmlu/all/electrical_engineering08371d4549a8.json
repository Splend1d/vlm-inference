A high voltage exists between the conductor and the ground. The maximum electric stress occurs at\n\nA. lower surface of the conductor.\nB. upper surface of the conductor.\nC. the ground surface.\nD. midway between the conductor and ground.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. upper surface of the conductor.\n\nWhen there is a high voltage between the conductor and the ground, the electric stress is concentrated at the point where the voltage is highest. This occurs at the upper surface of the conductor, where the electric field is strongest. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. lower surface of the conductor: The electric stress would be concentrated at the upper surface, not the lower surface.\nC. the ground surface: The electric stress is not concentrated at the ground surface, but rather at the point where the conductor and ground are in contact.\nD. midway between the conductor and ground: This option is not a valid point for the maximum electric stress to occur.",
