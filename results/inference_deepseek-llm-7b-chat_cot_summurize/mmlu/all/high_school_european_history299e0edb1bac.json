Article I\nB. Article II\nC. Article III\nD. Article IV\n\nassistant:The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, also known as the Nazi-Soviet Pact, was a nonaggression pact signed by Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. The pact was a secret agreement between the two countries that aimed to divide up Eastern Europe between them. However, just six years after the signing of the pact, Germany violated it by launching a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, known as Operation Barbarossa.\n\nThe article in the pact that was violated by Operation Barbarossa was Article II. This article stated that if either Germany or the Soviet Union became the target of a third-party attack, the other party would not support the attacking power. However, just days after the pact was signed, Germany and Italy declared war on the Soviet Union, violating Article II and leading to the start of World War II.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Article II.",
