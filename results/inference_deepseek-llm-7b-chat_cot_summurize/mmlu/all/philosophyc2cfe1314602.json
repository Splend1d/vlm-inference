This means that an action can only be considered morally right if it can be applied to all people in all circumstances. Therefore, according to Kant, we should act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\n\nA. performing the action that leads to the greatest total happiness is not a requirement of Kant's moral theory. While happiness may be a result of following the categorical imperative, it is not the primary consideration in determining what is morally right.\n\nC. behaving only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave is not a requirement of Kant's moral theory. According to Kant, we should not base our moral judgments on the behavior of individuals, but on the laws that govern their actions. Therefore, we should not try to behave as a perfectly virtuous person would behave, but rather as a rational being would in accordance with the categorical imperative.\n\nD. placing the interests of others above the interests of ourselves is not a requirement of Kant's moral theory. According to Kant, we should act solely on the basis of duty, not out of self-interest or concern for the consequences to ourselves. Therefore, placing the interests of others above our own is not a necessary condition for acting morally according to Kant.",
