Tyrannosaurus\n\nassistant:The largest animal ever to live on Earth is the blue whale. The blue whale is a marine mammal, the largest animal that has ever lived. It is known for its massive size, with an average length of 25-30 meters (82-98 feet) and a weight of up to 180 metric tons (198 US tons). The blue whale has a large mouth and a distinctive blowhole on its back, through which it breathes air.\n\nIn contrast, the giant squid, woolly mammoth, and Tyrannosaurus are not as large as the blue whale. The giant squid is a giant marine invertebrate, but it is not the largest animal that has ever lived. The woolly mammoth, which is now extinct, was a large land animal, but it was smaller than the blue whale. The Tyrannosaurus is a large carnivorous dinosaur, but it was also not as large as the blue whale.",
