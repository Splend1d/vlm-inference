Automatic stabilizers are a type of fiscal policy that are designed to help the economy recover from a recession by promoting deficit spending during recessions and surplus budgets during expansions. However, automatic stabilizers are not the only government policies that promote deficit spending during recessions and surplus budgets during expansions. Other policies such as monetary policy and fiscal policy also play a role in promoting deficit spending and surplus budgets during these periods.",
