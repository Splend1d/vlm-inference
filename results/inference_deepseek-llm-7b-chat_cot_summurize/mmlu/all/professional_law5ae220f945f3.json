Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n\nassistant:The court will likely allow the case to go to the jury. The man was detained and confined by the security officers without any legal justification, and he was not given a chance to produce receipts immediately. The fact that he was detained in a chair for 20 minutes without any legal reason can be considered as false imprisonment. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established - there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.",
