In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\nA. the id\nB. the ego\nC. the superego\nD. the Oedipus complex\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. the ego. In this scenario, the ego is dominant because it represents the part of the personality that acts as a mediator between the id (the source of unconscious impulses) and the superego (the source of moral and ethical values). The ego helps the individual make decisions and choose between their desires and the demands of society. In this case, the temptation to study for the test (representing the demands of society) was overpowered by the desire to spend time with Jacques (representing an unconscious impulse), demonstrating the dominance of the ego.",
