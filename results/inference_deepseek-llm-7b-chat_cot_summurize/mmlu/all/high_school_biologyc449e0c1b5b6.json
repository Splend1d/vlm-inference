A mRNA molecule with a complementary codon is transcribed from the DNA in the process of protein synthesis a tRNA pairs with a mRNA codon. What is the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon?\n\nA. 5\u2032-G-T-A-3\u2032\nB. 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032\nC. 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032\nD. 5-\u2032U-A-C-3\u2032\n\nassistant:The tRNA anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon, which means that they pair up in a complementary way during translation. In this case, the mRNA codon is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032, so the tRNA anticodon would be 5\u2032-U-A-C-3\u2032.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 5\u2032-U-A-C-3\u2032.",
