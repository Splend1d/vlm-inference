Expansion of an interregional canal system\n\nassistant:The Mongol empire used the emphasis on trade networks to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area. This is evident in the information provided, which states that the Mongol khans allowed for the movement of merchants and travelers across their territory without fear for their lives or property. This created secure trade routes that made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. These trade routes also facilitated the spread of new foods, inventions, and ideas from one civilization to others and from one civilization to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. The other options, expansion of bureaucracy to reinforce dominance, the use of state-sponsored religion to legitimize the government, and the expansion of an interregional canal system, are not mentioned or implied in the information provided.",
