For every minute she exercises, her heart rate increases 5 beats per minute. How long will it take her to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute?\n\nA. 5 minutes\nB. 14 minutes\nC. 34 minutes\nD. 70 minutes\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the equation:\n\nheart rate = (initial heart rate) + (increase per minute * number of minutes)\n\nWe are given Trish's initial heart rate (50 beats per minute) and the increase per minute (5 beats per minute). We want to find the number of minutes it takes for her heart rate to reach 120 beats per minute.\n\nheart rate = (50 beats per minute) + (5 beats per minute * number of minutes)\n120 beats per minute = (50 beats per minute) + (5 beats per minute * number of minutes)\n\nLet's solve for the number of minutes:\n\n50 beats per minute + 5 beats per minute * number of minutes = 120 beats per minute\n50 + 5 * number of minutes = 120\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of minutes:\n\n5 * number of minutes = 120 - 50\n5 * number of minutes = 70\nnumber of minutes = 70 / 5\nnumber of minutes = 14\n\nSo, it will take Trish 14 minutes to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute. The answer is B. 14 minutes.",
