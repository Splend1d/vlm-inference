Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n\nassistant:The woman is seeking state funding for her surgery, but the state law only allows state funding for surgery for those who have resided in the state for one year, except in emergency situations. The woman has lived in the state for two months and does not qualify for state funding. The woman has sued to invalidate the state law that prohibits state funding of her surgery, claiming that it burdens her fundamental right to health care.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care. The state law is preventing the woman from receiving necessary medical care, which is a fundamental right to health care. The law is not reasonable, as it is preventing the woman from receiving the necessary medical care due to a technicality of her residency status. The state has limited resources, but the law is not a reasonable way to conserve those resources, as it is preventing a person from receiving necessary medical care. Additionally, the law is not reasonable in preventing the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents, as the woman is not a transient nonresident, but a permanent resident seeking necessary medical care. Finally, the law is not reasonable in preventing the woman's fundamental right to travel, as her right to travel is not being burdened by the state law.",
