Decrease the model complexity.\n\nOverfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and becomes unable to generalize to new, unseen data. One way to combat overfitting is to decrease the model complexity, which means making the model simpler or using fewer features. This can be achieved by reducing the number of layers in a neural network, decreasing the number of nodes in each layer, or using a simpler model structure altogether.\n\nIncreasing the amount of training data (A) can help the model learn more general patterns, but it will not directly address the issue of overfitting. Improving the optimization algorithm (B) can help the model converge faster and more accurately, but it will not necessarily decrease the model complexity. Reducing the noise in the training data (D) can help make the training data more representative of the underlying distribution, but it will not directly impact the model complexity.",
