In this case, the screenwriter transferred their right to receive a percentage of the proceeds from the distribution of the movie to their friend, without receiving anything in return.\n\nThe other options are not applicable in this situation. An equitable lien is a legal claim on property for the payment of a debt or performance of an obligation. A conditional assignment is a situation where the transfer of property is dependent on the fulfillment of certain conditions. An irrevocable assignment is a situation where the transfer of property is permanent and cannot be revoked.",
