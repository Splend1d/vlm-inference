The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. However, the court likely found that the manufacturer's knowledge of the product's flammability and the fact that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures were not intervening causes. Instead, they were the direct cause of the fire and the guest's injuries. Therefore, the manufacturer's liability remained, despite the presence of the arsonist and the hotel's negligence.",
