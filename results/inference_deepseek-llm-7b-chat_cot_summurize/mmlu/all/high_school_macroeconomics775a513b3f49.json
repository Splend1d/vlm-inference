According to Keynesian analysis, which is a macroeconomic theory, the Great Depression was caused by a lack of spending (option A). Keynes argued that during a recession, people and businesses tend to save more and spend less, leading to a vicious cycle of declining economic activity. This lack of demand causes firms to cut back on production and, in turn, leads to more job losses and further reductions in consumption.\n\nKeynes proposed a solution to this problem, which he called \"demand management.\" This involves the government spending money to increase demand and stimulate economic growth. This is in contrast to classical economics, which advocates for reducing government intervention in the economy and letting the market find its own equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. a lack of spending.",
