False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V ) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective.\n\nThis statement is true. If T is a linear transformation between two vector spaces V and W, and dim(V ) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective. This is because the dimension of the codomain W is strictly greater than the dimension of the domain V, which means that every element in V can be transformed to a unique element in W.\n\nStatement 2: Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.\n\nThis statement is false. If T: V -> V is a linear transformation between two vector spaces V and V, and T is injective, then it is not necessarily a bijection. A bijection is a one-to-one correspondence between two sets, meaning that every element in the domain can be mapped to a unique element in the codomain, and every element in the codomain can be mapped to a unique element in the domain. However, in the case of a linear transformation between the same vector space, T is only injective, not one-to-one. There may be multiple elements in the domain that map to the same element in the codomain. Therefore, T is not a bijection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
