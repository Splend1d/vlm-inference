The manufacturer expanded its plant capacity and produced 2500 watches per month, which is a disproportionate increase in product that exceeds the contractual estimates of 1000 to 1500 watches per month. The wholesaler could no longer pay for that volume of watches, and the manufacturer's request to compel the wholesaler to buy its full output each month as required by the contract is reasonable, given the breach of contract by the wholesaler.",
