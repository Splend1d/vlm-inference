Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\n\nA. For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB. The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC. The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD. The determinant of M is nonzero.\n\nassistant:To determine which conditions are equivalent, we can analyze the properties of each condition and compare them.\n\nA. For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB. The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC. The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD. The determinant of M is nonzero.\n\nWe can see that conditions A and B are related to the rank of the matrix M, while conditions C and D are related to the nullity of the matrix M. The rank-nullity theorem states that the rank of a matrix plus the nullity of the matrix is equal to the dimension of the space. In this case, the dimension of the space is 5.\n\nNow let's analyze the conditions:\n\nA. For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent. This means that the columns of M are linearly independent.\nB. The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution. This means that the rank of M is equal to the dimension of the space.\nC. The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This means that the nullity of M is zero.\nD. The determinant of M is nonzero. This condition is not directly related to the nullity or rank of M.\n\nNow let's analyze the equivalence between the conditions:\n\n* A and B are equivalent because if the columns of M are linearly independent, then the rank of M is equal to the dimension of the space, and vice versa.\n* A and C are not equivalent because if the columns of M are linearly independent, it does not guarantee that the system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\n* B and C are equivalent because if the homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution, then the nullity of M is zero, and vice versa.\n* C and D are not equivalent because the determinant of M being nonzero does not guarantee that the nullity of M is zero or vice versa.\n\nNow let's determine which condition is equivalent to NONE of the other four:\n\n* None of the other four conditions are equivalent to D because D is not related to the other conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
