In order to succeed on a negligence claim, the repair shop employee must prove that the manufacturer owed her a duty of care, that the manufacturer breached that duty, and that the breach caused her damages. If the manufacturer did not engage in extreme and outrageous conduct, it may be difficult for the repair shop employee to establish that the manufacturer breached its duty of care. Additionally, even if the manufacturer did breach its duty of care, the employee would still need to prove that her emotional distress was caused by the breach, which may be difficult to do without evidence of extreme and outrageous conduct.",
