No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. This answer is incorrect because the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding. The equal protection clause requires that the government treat similar cases in a similar manner, but it does not prevent the government from treating dissimilar cases differently.\n\nC. This answer is incorrect because surplus government property is generally subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause. The establishment clause prohibits the government from preferring one religious group over another. The fact that the property is surplus does not exempt it from the establishment clause.\n\nD. This answer is incorrect because the primary or substantial support test is a test of whether the government's purpose in enacting the law is to primarily or substantially support religious activities. The law in this case is not primarily or substantially supporting religious activities.",
