ATP binding to the myosin cross bridges.\nD. calcium binding to troponin.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. calcium binding to tropomyosin.\n\nWhen skeletal muscle is stimulated, it causes the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These calcium ions bind to tropomyosin, which is a protein located on the actin filaments. This binding of calcium to tropomyosin causes a conformational change in the tropomyosin, which exposes the actin binding sites on the myosin filaments.\n\nThis conformational change in tropomyosin allows the myosin cross bridges to bind to the actin filaments, initiating the contractile process. The other options are not the primary triggers for the contractile process in skeletal muscle.",
