This means that they had already invoked their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during any questioning. Therefore, any statements made by the man to the woman while they were together would not violate their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nThe police planting a listening device in the woman's jail cell without first securing a warrant would be a violation of the defendants' Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. This would give the man's attorney grounds to file a motion to exclude the incriminating statement from being introduced as evidence at trial.",
