Either\nD. Neither\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. joules.\n\nHeat transfer can be measured in joules, as joules are the unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). One joule is the amount of work done or energy transferred when a force of one newton (N) is applied through a distance of one meter (m).",
