Factors are numbers that can be multiplied together to equal $12$. The positive factors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6,$ and $12$. The negative factors of $12$ are $-1, -2, -3, -4, -6,$ and $-12$. Therefore, $12$ is a multiple of $6$ positive integers and $6$ negative integers. The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{D: 6}}$.\nThe answer is: 6",
