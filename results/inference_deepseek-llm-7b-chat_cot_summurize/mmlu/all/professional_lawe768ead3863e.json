According to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government is required to obtain a search warrant before conducting a search or seizure of an individual's property. In this case, the police did not have a search warrant when they seized the cocaine from the husband's briefcase, which means that the seizure was illegal and the evidence obtained as a result should not be admissible in court.\n\nA. granted, because the seizure violated the husband's right of privacy, is incorrect. While the wife did have a right to open the briefcase, the husband's right to privacy was not violated.\n\nC. denied, because the initial seizure was made by a private individual, is incorrect. The seizure of the cocaine was made by the police, not the wife.\n\nD. denied, because the husband left the briefcase in the kitchen in plain view, is incorrect. While the husband may have left the briefcase in plain view, the wife's decision to open it and find the cocaine does not negate the illegality of the police's seizure of the drugs.",
