When using radiolabeled compounds to study the enzyme, it is found that the enzyme catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group on one reactant to the other reactant. Which of the following categories would this new enzyme fall under?\n\nA. Oxidoreductase\nB. Transferase\nC. Hydrolase\nD. Lyase\n\nassistant:This new enzyme falls under the category of a transferase. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a nitrogen group from one reactant to the other reactant, which is a characteristic of transferases. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Transferase.",
