NaBr\nB. NiSO3\nC. CrCl3\nD. Mn(NO3)2\n\nassistant:To determine which of the following is expected to be the least soluble in water, we need to look at the solubility rules and solubility trends for the elements in the compounds.\n\nNaBr is soluble in water, so it can be eliminated from the options.\n\nNiSO3 is soluble in water, so it can be eliminated from the options.\n\nCrCl3 is soluble in water, so it can be eliminated from the options.\n\nMn(NO3)2 is expected to be the least soluble in water, as it is a salt of a metal and a non-polar ligand, with a high charge on the metal and a high ionic radius. This would make it difficult for the molecules to dissolve in water.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Mn(NO3)2.",
