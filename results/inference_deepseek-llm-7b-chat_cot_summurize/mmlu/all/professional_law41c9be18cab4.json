The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.\n\nThe court will most likely decide that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of the owner to use the doorway, as the party wall and doorway were integral to the twin home and its intended purpose. The fact that the deed did not explicitly reserve a right to use the doorway does not negate the existence of an implied easement.\n\nIn this case, the owner sold one lot but still needed to access the doorway for his residential unit. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that an implied easement was created by law for the benefit of the owner to continue using the doorway. The court would most likely order that the owner has an implied right to use the doorway for his residential unit, and the buyer cannot prevent access to the owner due to the defective deed.",
