Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\nD. Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\n\nassistant:An auditor generally performs the following procedures regarding subsequent events:\n\nB. Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n\nJustification:\nSubsequent events are events that occur after the end of the financial period being audited. Auditors need to assess whether any such events have had a significant impact on the financial statements. An auditor's responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements, and this opinion is based on the financial statements being free from material misstatement, including fraud. Therefore, the auditor needs to evaluate whether any events that occurred after the year-end have resulted in a material misstatement of the financial statements.\n\nOption A is related to inventory items that were ordered before the year-end but arrived after the year-end. This is not necessarily a subsequent event, as inventory control is an ongoing internal control activity. An auditor would inspect inventory items as part of their normal audit procedures, but it would not specifically be considered a subsequent event procedure.\n\nOption C is related to reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year-end. While this could be a relevant subsequent event, it is not the most appropriate choice because it is not directly related to internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n\nOption D is related to comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. This is a normal audit procedure, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is option B: Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.",
