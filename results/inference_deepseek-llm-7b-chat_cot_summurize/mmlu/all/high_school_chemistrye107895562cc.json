Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.\n\nIt is possible that the limestone used in the experiment was not pure CaCO3, but rather a mixture of calcium carbonate and calcium hydrogen carbonate. This could explain why the student was getting low results, as the reaction between the acid and the limestone would depend on the specific composition of the limestone.\n\nA.
