The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since he reasonably believed she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man.\n\nThe alter ego rule, also known as the \"rule against perpetuities,\" is a legal doctrine that prevents a person from using force or threats to prevent another person from exercising a legal right. In this case, the defendant believed that the woman was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man and therefore used reasonable force to protect her. The defendant did not stand in any personal relationship with the woman, but he still had a duty to protect her from harm. Therefore, he was justified in using force in her defense under the alter ego rule.",
