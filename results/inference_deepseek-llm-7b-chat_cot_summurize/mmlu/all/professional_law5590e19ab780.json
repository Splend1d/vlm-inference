To prevail, the professor would need to show that the television station and the anchorman acted with actual malice, which means they knew their statements were false or acted in reckless disregard for the truth. In this case, the professor may argue that the anchorman's comments were made with actual malice because they were clearly meant to attack the professor personally and were not based on any actual facts or events. If the professor can prove actual malice, he may have a strong case against the television station and the anchorman.",
