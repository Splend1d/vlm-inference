The women's group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men's club was subject to the state's anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women's group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men's club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor's office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don't vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney's office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor's official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney's suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance.

The women's group has not yet suffered an injury that can be redressed by a declaration from the court. The suit is still in the early stages, and the women's group has not yet been denied admission to the men's club or been denied access to the anti-discrimination act. Therefore, the court may decide that the case is not yet ripe and can wait until there is a concrete injury that can be remedied by a declaration from the court.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. there is no case or controversy - The case is ripe, and the women's group has instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court.\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion - The court may grant the relief sought if it is determined that a declaratory judgment is necessary.\nD. the women's group lacks standing - The women's group has standing to bring the suit, as they have been denied admission to the men's club and are seeking a declaration from the court as to whether the club is subject to the anti-discrimination act.",
