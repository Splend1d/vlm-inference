A out- of-state farmer who is a U. S. citizen has contracted, subsequent to the aforementioned law, to purchase a farm from a landowner, which is located in the state.

The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2.\nD. The national property power provision under Article IV, Section 3.\n\nassistant:The best constitutional argument to contest the validity of the state statute would be the contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts. This clause is found in the Tenth Amendment and states that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. In this case, the state law is impairing the contract between the landowner and the out-of-state farmer, making it null and void.\n\nThe other options are not as strong of arguments because they do not directly address the issue of the state law impairing the contract. The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not applicable because it protects citizens from state-level discrimination, not contracts. The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2 is also not applicable because it is not a part of the Constitution. The national property power provision under Article IV, Section 3 is not a relevant argument because it deals with states protecting their citizens' property rights, not with the impairment of contracts.",
