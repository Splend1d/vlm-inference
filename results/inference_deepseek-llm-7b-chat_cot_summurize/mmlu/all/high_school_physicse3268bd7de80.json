Describe the electron's subsequent circular motion.\n\nA. Clockwise rotation; radius of path = mv/(eB)\nB. Counterclockwise rotation; radius of path = mv/(eB)\nC. Clockwise rotation; radius of path = eB/(mv)\nD. Counterclockwise rotation; radius of path = eB/(mv)\n\nassistant:The electron's subsequent circular motion will be clockwise. The radius of the path will be mv/(eB), where m is the mass of the electron, e is the charge of the electron, B is the magnitude of the magnetic field, and v is the speed of the electron.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Counterclockwise rotation; radius of path = mv/(eB).",
