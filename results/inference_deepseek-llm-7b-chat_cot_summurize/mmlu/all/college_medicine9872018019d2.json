MERRF results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, which of the following best predicts the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring?\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected\nB. All males and no females will be affected\nC. Half of males and half of females will be affected\nD. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected\n\nassistant:The answer is D. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected.\n\nTo understand this answer, let's break down the information given in the question. MERRF is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA, which impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. This means that the disorder is passed down from the mother to her children.\n\nWhen an affected male and a normal female reproduce, there is a 50% chance that each child will inherit the mutated mitochondrial DNA. Since MERRF is an autosomal recessive disorder, the offspring will only be affected if they inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent).\n\nSince there is a 50% chance that each child will inherit the mutated gene, the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring would be:\n\nAffected: Non-affected = 1:2\n\nTherefore, one-fourth (25%) of the offspring will be affected.",
