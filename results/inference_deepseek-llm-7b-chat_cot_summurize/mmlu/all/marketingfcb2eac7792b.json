It is a place where goods are stored for moderate to long periods. Distribution centers and haulage transport are also places where goods are stored or transported, but they do not specifically store goods for moderate to long periods. Electronic data interchange is a system for exchanging business documents electronically, and it is not related to storing goods.",
