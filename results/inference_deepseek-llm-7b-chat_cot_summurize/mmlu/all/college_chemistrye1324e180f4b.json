It is a highly nonlinear and non-local equation, making it difficult to solve exactly for all systems. For simple systems with few degrees of freedom, such as a simple harmonic oscillator or a particle in a one-dimensional box, approximate solutions can be found using perturbation theory or numerical methods. However, for more complex systems, such as the helium atom, exact solutions cannot be obtained using the Schr\ufffddinger equation alone. Instead, these systems are typically described using postulates of quantum mechanics, such as the Schr\ufffddinger equation and the Pauli exclusion principle, and are analyzed using numerical methods or approximate solutions.",
