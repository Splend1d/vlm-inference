No, because the homeowner is estopped to deny the validity of the written contract.\nB. No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.\nC. Yes, because the agreement regarding the loan constituted a valid modification of the writing.\nD. Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n\nThe homeowner's inability to secure the loan from National Bank was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract. This means that the contract could only be formed if the homeowner was able to obtain the loan. Since the homeowner was unable to obtain the loan, the contract was never formed, and therefore, there was no breach of contract.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The homeowner is not estopped to deny the validity of the written contract. Estoppel refers to a situation where a person is prevented from denying something due to their own previous actions. In this case, the homeowner did not make any previous statements or actions that would prevent him from denying the validity of the contract.\n\nB. The agreement regarding the loan did not vary the express terms of the writing. The written contract clearly stated that the loan was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract, so the agreement regarding the loan did not change the terms of the contract.\n\nC. The agreement regarding the loan did not constitute a valid modification of the writing. The homeowner and the painter did not have the authority to modify the written contract without the written consent of the other party.",
