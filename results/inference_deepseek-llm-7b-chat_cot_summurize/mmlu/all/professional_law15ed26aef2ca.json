The suit charged the city with violating several federal statutes. During the trial, the association's attorney called the city attorney as an adverse witness. The city attorney asserted the attorney-client privilege and objected that the matters communicated to him were intended to be confidential. The issues raised by the objections of the city attorney should be resolved under\n\nA. federal privilege law.\nB. the privilege law of the forum state.\nC. either federal privilege law or the privilege law of the forum state as determined by the court.\nD. either federal privilege law or the privilege law of the forum state, whichever the court determines is more likely to admit the evidence.\n\nassistant:The attorney-client privilege is a common law doctrine that prevents an attorney from disclosing confidential communications made in the course of representing a client. The determination of which law applies to the privilege of an attorney-client communication can be complex and depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.\n\nIn this case, the national association brought suit against the city in federal court, charging the city with violating several federal statutes. Therefore, the issues raised by the city attorney's objections to the attorney-client privilege would likely be governed by federal privilege law.\n\nOption B, the privilege law of the forum state, would not apply in this situation as the case is being heard in federal court. Option C, either federal privilege law or the privilege law of the forum state as determined by the court, is too broad and uncertain. Option D, either federal privilege law or the privilege law of the forum state, whichever the court determines is more likely to admit the evidence, is also too broad and uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, federal privilege law.",
