The reaction is called esterification. In the reaction, the carboxylic acid donates its hydroxyl group (-OH) to the alcohol, which donates a hydrogen atom from its alkyl group (-R) to the carboxylic acid. The resulting compound is an ester. The amine in the question does not play a role in the formation of an ester.",
