Statement 2 | Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every solvable group is of prime-power order. This statement is true. In group theory, a solvable group is a group that can be transformed into an upper-case form by a series of conjugation and/or normal subgroup decompositions. It has been proven that a group of prime-power order is always solvable.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable. This statement is false. While it is true that a group of prime-power order is always a p-group (a group whose order is a power of a prime), it is not necessarily solvable. There exist p-groups that are not solvable, such as the direct product of two p-groups with different prime factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
