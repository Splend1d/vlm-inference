Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is constantly taking time off of work because they are hungover. This behavior is clearly morally wrong, as it shows a lack of responsibility and dedication to their job.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tells the bartender they are 24 years old, but they are actually only 17. While this may be a less serious moral wrongdoing, it is still dishonest behavior that can have negative consequences.",
