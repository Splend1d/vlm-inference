Pendleton Act of 1883.\n\nThe Pendleton Act of 1883, also known as the Civil Service Act, was a law that aimed to improve the efficiency and professionalism of the federal civil service in the United States. The law was passed as a response to the spoils system, which was a practice of rewarding political supporters with government jobs rather than basing appointments on merit or qualifications. The Pendleton Act created a civil service system based on competitive examinations, which replaced the spoils system and helped to ensure that government jobs were awarded based on merit rather than political affiliation.",
