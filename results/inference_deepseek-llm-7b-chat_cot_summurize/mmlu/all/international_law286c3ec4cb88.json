States are under an obligation to inform the UN Secretary-General about the progress of their negotiations\n\nassistant:B. States are under an obligation so to conduct themselves that the negotiations are meaningful\n\nIn international law, states have certain obligations when conducting negotiations. One of these obligations is to ensure that the negotiations are meaningful and productive. This means that states must engage in good faith and make a genuine effort to find a solution to the dispute at hand. They must also be open to compromise and willing to engage in dialogue with other parties to the negotiation.\n\nIt is important for states to fulfill this obligation because meaningful negotiations can help to resolve disputes peacefully and avoid the need for more drastic measures, such as conflict or war. Additionally, meaningful negotiations can help to promote cooperation and understanding between states, which can be beneficial in the long run.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. States are under an obligation so to conduct themselves that the negotiations are meaningful.",
