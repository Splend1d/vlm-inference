Diffusion refers to the spread of ideas, beliefs, and practices from one group to another, and is not a process that introduces change in culture. Instead, change in culture is introduced through processes such as innovation, where new ideas and practices are created, and acculturation, where groups come into contact with each other and adopt each other's practices.",
