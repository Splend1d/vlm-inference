A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt.

This is because the Hula Girl drink is a very strong and potent alcoholic drink, and the graduate consumed it even though she had never heard of it before. The graduate's actions were extreme and outrageous, as she became very dizzy and vomited over a customer, causing embarrassment and humiliation.",
