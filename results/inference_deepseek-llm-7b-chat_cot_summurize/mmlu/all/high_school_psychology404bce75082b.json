Freudian\nD. somatotype\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. idiographic.\n\nAccording to idiographic theories, people are unique and have their own distinct sets of traits, which makes them different from others. This theory focuses on understanding the individual differences in people's personalities, rather than trying to find general patterns or laws that apply to everyone.\n\nThe other options do not fit the question's criteria. A. nomothetic is a theory that seeks to understand general laws and patterns that apply to groups of people, while C. Freudian and D. somatotype are not theories of personality at all. Freudian is a theory developed by Sigmund Freud, which focuses on the unconscious mind and its influence on behavior, and somatotype is a theory that classifies people into three types based on their physical proportions and muscle development.",
