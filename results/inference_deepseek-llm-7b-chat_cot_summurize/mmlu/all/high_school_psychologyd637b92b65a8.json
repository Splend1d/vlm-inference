When he moves his gaze to a blank piece of white paper, he is likely to see an afterimage that is\n\nA. green\nB. yellow\nC. red\nD. blue\n\nassistant:An afterimage is a temporary visual phenomenon that occurs when the brain is unable to continue processing a strong, rapid-changing stimulus, such as a flashing light. The color of the afterimage depends on the color of the original stimulus. In this case, Curtis stared at a yellow star for a full minute, which means his brain was processing a yellow stimulus. Therefore, when he moves his gaze to the blank piece of white paper, he is likely to see an afterimage that is green. So the answer is A. green.",
