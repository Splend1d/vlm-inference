The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner and the roofer agreed on the terms of the repair work, but the agreement was made orally. According to the Statute of Frauds, any contract that is not in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought is unenforceable. Therefore, if the homeowner fails to pay the agreed amount, the roofer would not be able to enforce the contract through the courts.",
