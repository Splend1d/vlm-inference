The neural connections to the primary visual cortex are not fully connected.\n\nBabies have poor vision for the first few weeks of life because their neural connections to the primary visual cortex are not fully connected. This is because the visual cortex, which is responsible for processing visual information, is not yet fully developed in the brain of a newborn baby. As the baby grows and develops, the connections between the eyes, the retina, and the visual cortex become stronger, allowing the baby to see more clearly.",
