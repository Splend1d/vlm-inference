Microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract in order to move the growth cone forward. Exposure of the neuron to cytochasalin B at this stage of development causes\n\nA. microtubules in the axon to undergo reversible dissociation\nB. microtubules in the axon to undergo irreversible dissociation\nC. microfilaments in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization\nD. microfilaments in the microspike to undergo irreversible depolymerization\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. microtubules in the axon to undergo reversible dissociation.\n\nThe process of nerve outgrowth is a complex and fascinating one that involves the development of the neuron's axon. The growth cone, located at the tip of the axon, is responsible for extending and retracting microspikes in order to move the growth cone forward. This process is crucial for the development of the neuron's axon.\n\nExposure to cytochalasin B, a drug that inhibits the activity of myosin, can disrupt this process. Cytochalasin B can cause microtubules in the axon to undergo reversible dissociation. Reversible dissociation refers to the process where microtubules are temporarily disassembled, but can later reform. This can lead to the disruption of the normal growth and extension of the microspikes, which can potentially cause developmental problems in the neuron.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. microtubules in the axon to undergo irreversible dissociation: This is not the correct answer because irreversible dissociation means that microtubules cannot be reformed, and this would disrupt the normal function of the neuron.\n\nC. microfilaments in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization: This is not the correct answer because depolymerization refers to the process of breaking down microfilaments, not microtubules.\n\nD. microfilaments in the microspike to undergo irreversible depolymerization: This is not the correct answer because irreversible depolymerization would also disrupt the normal function of the neuron.",
