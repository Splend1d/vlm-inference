For every $100 increase in disposable income saving increases $10. Given this information\n\nA. the marginal propensity to consume is .80.\nB. the marginal propensity to save is .20.\nC. the marginal propensity to save is .10.\nD. the marginal propensity to save is .90.\n\nassistant:Let's denote disposable income as D, consumption spending as C, and savings as S.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n\nC = 8000\nD = 10000\nS = D - C = 10000 - 8000 = 2000\n\nNow, we want to find the marginal propensity to save (mps), which is the percentage of the change in disposable income that is saved. We know that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases $10. Therefore, the mps can be calculated as:\n\nmps = (\u0394S / \u0394D) * 100\n\nSince S = 2000, we have \u0394S = 2000 and \u0394D = 200.\n\nmps = (200 / 2000) * 100 = 0.10\n\nSo, the marginal propensity to save is 0.10, which corresponds to option C.",
