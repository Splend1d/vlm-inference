What is the weight of the box on the moon if the moon has 1/80th the mass and 1/4th the radius of the Earth?\n\nA. 1 N\nB. 10 N\nC. 16 N\nD. 20 N\n\nassistant:To find the weight of the box on the moon, we first need to find the mass and radius of the moon. \n\nLet's denote the mass of the moon as M_moon and the radius of the moon as R_moon. The mass of the Earth is 5.97 x 10^24 kg, and the radius is 6.37 x 10^6 m. \n\nFrom the given information, we know that the moon has 1/80th the mass of the Earth:\n\nM_moon = 1 / 80 * 5.97 x 10^24 kg\n\nAnd 1/4th the radius of the Earth:\n\nR_moon = 1 / 4 * 6.37 x 10^6 m\n\nNow, we can find the weight of the box on the moon:\n\nWeight on moon = Weight on Earth * (mass of moon / mass of Earth) * (radius of moon / radius of Earth)\nWeight on moon = 80 N * (1 / 80) * (1 / 4)\nWeight on moon = 80 * (1/80) * (1/4)\nWeight on moon = 1/4 N\n\nSo, the weight of the box on the moon is 1 N. The correct answer is A.",
