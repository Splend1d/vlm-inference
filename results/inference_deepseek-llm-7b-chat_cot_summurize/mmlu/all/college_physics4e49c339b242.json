The mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, and the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A. Which of the following is true of forces F_A and F_B?\n\nA. F_B = 1/4 F_A\nB. F_B = 1/2 F_A\nC. F_B = 2F_A\nD. F_B = 4F_A\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the forces F_A and F_B in terms of their magnitudes.\n\nGiven that the mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, we can write the following relationships:\n\nMass of object A = m_A\nMass of object B = 2m_A\n\nNow, let's consider the acceleration of object B. We know that the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A. We can write this relationship as:\n\nAcceleration of object A = a_A\nAcceleration of object B = 2a_A\n\nNext, let's consider the net force acting on object B, which is F_B. We can write the relationship between the net force and the mass and acceleration as follows:\n\nNet force F_B = m_B \\* a_B\n\nWe know that the mass of object B is twice that of object A, and the acceleration is twice that of object A. Therefore, we can write:\n\nNet force F_B = (2m_A) \\* (2a_A)\n\nNow, let's consider the net force acting on object A, which is F_A. We can write the relationship between the net force and the mass and acceleration as follows:\n\nNet force F_A = m_A \\* a_A\n\nWe know that the mass of object A is the same as the mass of object B, and the acceleration is the same as the acceleration of object B. Therefore, we can write:\n\nNet force F_A = (2m_A) \\* (2a_A)\n\nNow, let's consider the net force acting on object B, which is F_B. We can write the relationship between the net force and the net force as follows:\n\nF_B = m_B \\* a_B\n\nWe know that the net force acting on object B is twice the net force acting on object A. Therefore, we can write:\n\nF_B = 2F_A\n\nFrom this relationship, we can see that F_B is twice F_A. Therefore, the correct answer is C. F_B = 2F_A.",
