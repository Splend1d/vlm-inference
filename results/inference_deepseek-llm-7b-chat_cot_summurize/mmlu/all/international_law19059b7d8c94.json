Alan Gerwith\nB. Emmanuel Kant\nC. John Locke\nD. Jeremy Bentham\n\nassistant:The philosopher who called the idea of natural rights 'nonsense on stilts' is Emmanuel Kant. Kant was a German philosopher who lived from 1724 to 1804. He is known for his work on ethics, metaphysics, and aesthetics. Kant believed that humans have a duty to follow the moral law, which is based on reason, rather than on any natural rights that individuals may possess. He thought that the idea of natural rights was a flawed concept, and that it was based on a misunderstanding of human nature. Instead, Kant argued that humans should act in accordance with the moral law, which is based on reason and the idea of the \"categorical imperative.\"",
