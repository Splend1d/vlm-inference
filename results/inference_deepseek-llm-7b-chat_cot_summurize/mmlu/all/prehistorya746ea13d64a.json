The Valley of Mexico, also known as the Valley of Mexico region, is an area that has a long history of human habitation. The population in this region was supported by a variety of means, including agricultural irrigation, terraces, and artificially raised fields called chinampas.\n\nAgricultural irrigation allowed the people of the Valley of Mexico to grow a variety of crops, including maize, beans, and squash, which were essential to their diet. Terraces were used to control the flow of water and prevent erosion, while chinampas were raised fields that were created by building up soil on top of waterways.\n\nWhile some of the other options listed may have been practiced by people in the Valley of Mexico, they were not the primary means of supporting the population. Long-distance trade, salt mining, and stone masonry were important, but they were not the main sources of food or other necessities for the people in the region. Hunting and gathering, fishing, and cultivation of root crops were also practiced, but they were not the primary means of supporting the population.\n\nFinally, advanced medical, artisanal, and metallurgical technologies were not the primary means of supporting the population in the Valley of Mexico. While these technologies may have been important for some aspects of life in the region, they were not the main sources of food or other necessities for the people in the area.",
