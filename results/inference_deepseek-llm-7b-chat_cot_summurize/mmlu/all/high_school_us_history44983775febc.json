George Washington's Farewell Address\nC. Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address\nD. Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Arsenal of Democracy\" speech\n\nassistant:Kennedy's speech, which was delivered on September 12, 1962, is best compared to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Both speeches were important moments in American history and both aimed to inspire their respective audiences.\n\nIn Kennedy's speech, he announced the United States' intention to land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth before the end of the decade. He stated that this goal would serve to organize and measure the best of America's energies and skills, and that the United States was willing to accept this challenge and win it.\n\nLincoln's Gettysburg Address, delivered on November 19, 1863, was a speech given at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg. In his speech, Lincoln addressed the purpose of the Civil War and the soldiers who had died in it, stating that the war was fought to \"save or destroy a government, which shall insure to each member of this race, within this continent, the privilege of enjoying life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nWhile Kennedy's speech was focused on the space program and the technological advancements it represented, Lincoln's address was focused on the purpose of the Civil War and the sacrifices made by those who fought in it. However, both speeches were important moments in American history and served to inspire their respective audiences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.",
