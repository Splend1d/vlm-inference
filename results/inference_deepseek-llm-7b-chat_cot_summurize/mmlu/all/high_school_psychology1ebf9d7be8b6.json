The occipital lobes are responsible for processing visual information, so any damage to these areas could lead to visual impairments or changes in vision. It's worth noting that damage to the occipital lobes can also potentially affect other senses, such as hearing, balance, and touch, but these are less likely to be directly affected compared to the sense of sight.",
