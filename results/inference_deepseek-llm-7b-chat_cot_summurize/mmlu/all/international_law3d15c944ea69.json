Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form and governed by international law\nC. Treaties are both the written and oral agreements between States\nD. Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form governed either by international or domestic law\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form and governed by international law.\n\nAccording to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), a treaty is a legal agreement concluded between two or more states, international organizations, or non-state entities. However, not all agreements concluded between these parties are considered treaties. A treaty must be in written form, be governed by international law, and have a specific subject matter that is of general interest to the international community.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the definition of a treaty does not include agreements concluded between international organizations and non-State entities. Option C is incorrect because treaties are specifically defined as agreements concluded between states in written form and governed by international law, not both written and oral agreements. Option D is incorrect because it includes both international and domestic law, while the VCLT specifies that treaties are governed exclusively by international law.",
