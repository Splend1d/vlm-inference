T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\nB. T2, unlike T1, is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\nC. T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\nD. T2, unlike T1, is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\n\nT1-weighted imaging is sensitive to water molecules with short transverse relaxation times (T2) and long longitudinal relaxation times (T1). This means that T1-weighted images show more contrast in tissues with a higher proportion of short T2 water molecules, such as highly vascularized tissues like the liver, spleen, and kidney.\n\nT2-weighted imaging, on the other hand, is sensitive to water molecules with long T2 values, which means it shows more contrast in tissues with a higher proportion of long T2 water molecules, such as fat-containing tissues like muscle and adipose tissue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because T1 and T2 are not directly related to the sensitivity of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pulse sequence to very low-frequency molecular motions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it is the reverse of the correct answer. T1-weighted imaging is sensitive to water molecules with short T2 and long T1 values, while T2-weighted imaging is sensitive to water molecules with long T2 values.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is the reverse of the correct answer. T1-weighted imaging is sensitive to water molecules with short T2 and long T1 values, while T2-weighted imaging is sensitive to water molecules with long T2 values.",
