The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.

The search of the husband's apartment was conducted by the police with the landlord's permission, which was sufficient apparent authority to authorize the search. The exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings, so the evidence obtained from the search of the husband's apartment can be used against him in the grand jury. The husband's argument that the warrantless search was unconstitutional is not sufficient to suppress the evidence. Therefore, the correct answer is D. denied.",
