We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\nD. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\n\nassistant:C. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\n\nTo compute the 95% confidence interval, we use the formula:\n\nCI = mean \u00b1 (1.96 * standard deviation / \u221an)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, mean is the average donation, standard deviation is the standard deviation of donations, and n is the number of donations.\n\nFor this problem, we have:\nmean = $155\nstandard deviation = $32\nn = 100\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCI = $155 \u00b1 (1.96 * $32 / \u221a100)\nCI = $155 \u00b1 (1.96 * $32 / 10)\nCI = $155 \u00b1 (1.96 * 3.2)\nCI = $155 \u00b1 6.1312\n\nSo the 95% confidence interval for the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219. Answer choice C is the most appropriate statement.",
