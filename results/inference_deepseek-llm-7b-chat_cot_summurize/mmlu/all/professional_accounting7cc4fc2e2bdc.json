If the IT is improved to 8 times while the COGS remains the same, a substantial amount of funds is released from or additionally invested in inventory. In fact,\n\nA. $160,000 is released.\nB. $100,000 is additionally invested.\nC. $60,000 is additionally invested.\nD. $60,000 is released.\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the formula for inventory turnover, which is:\n\nInventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nWe are given that the initial inventory turnover is 5 times, so:\n\nInitial Inventory Turnover = 5\n\nWe are also given that the cost of goods sold is $800,000, so:\n\nInitial Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n5 = $800,000 / Average Inventory\nAverage Inventory = $800,000 / 5\nAverage Inventory = $160,000\n\nNow, we are told that the inventory turnover is improved to 8 times, so:\n\nImproved Inventory Turnover = 8\n\nWe are given that the cost of goods sold remains the same, so:\n\nImproved Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Improved Average Inventory\n8 = $800,000 / Improved Average Inventory\nImproved Average Inventory = $800,000 / 8\nImproved Average Inventory = $100,000\n\nNow, we can calculate the difference in funds released or invested by comparing the initial and improved average inventories:\n\nDifference in Funds = Improved Average Inventory - Initial Average Inventory\nDifference in Funds = $100,000 - $160,000\nDifference in Funds = -$60,000\n\nBased on the calculations, a substantial amount of funds is released from inventory, which is a negative value.
