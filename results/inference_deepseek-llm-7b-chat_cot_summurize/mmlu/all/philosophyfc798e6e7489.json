Socrates raises several points of contention, and the main issues can be summarized as follows:\n\nA. There are many other things that are also holy. Socrates argues that there are multiple things that people consider holy, such as religious artifacts, temples, and rituals. These things can be considered holy, but they are not necessarily the same as prosecuting wrongdoers.\n\nB. Prosecuting wrongdoers is not always holy. Socrates points out that there might be cases where prosecuting wrongdoers is not considered holy, such as when the wrongdoer is a family member or a close friend. In such cases, prosecuting the wrongdoer might be seen as unjust, rather than holy.\n\nC. There is disagreement about what counts as \"wrongdoing.\" Euthyphro believes that only certain wrongdoings, such as those committed against the gods, are holy. However, Socrates argues that different people might have different opinions about what constitutes \"wrongdoing,\" and therefore, prosecuting wrongdoers might not always be seen as holy.\n\nD. All of the above. Socrates' objections to Euthyphro's definition of the holy encompass all three points mentioned above. He argues that there are many other things that are considered holy, prosecuting wrongdoers is not always holy, and there is disagreement about what counts as \"wrongdoing.\"",
