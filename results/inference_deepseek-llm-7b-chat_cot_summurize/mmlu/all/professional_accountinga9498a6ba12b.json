Under these circumstances, the accountant should\n\nA. Issue an adverse opinion because of the departure from GAAP.\nB. Express no assurance of any kind on the entity's financial statements.\nC. Emphasize that the financial statements are for limited use only.\nD. Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the accountant must disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report. The accountant should also disclose the reason for the departure from GAAP and provide their professional judgment on the materiality of the leases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an adverse opinion is only issued when there is a significant departure from GAAP that is material to the financial statements. In this case, the departure from GAAP is material, but the accountant is still issuing a modified report rather than an adverse opinion.\n\nOption B is incorrect because expressing no assurance of any kind on the entity's financial statements is not an appropriate response in this situation. The accountant should provide some level of assurance on the financial statements, even if modified.\n\nOption C is incorrect because emphasizing that the financial statements are for limited use only is not an appropriate response in this situation. The accountant should provide some level of assurance on the financial statements, even if modified.",
