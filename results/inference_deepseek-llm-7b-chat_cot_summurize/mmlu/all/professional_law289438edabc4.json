However, this option is incorrect because the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state deprivations of life, liberty, or property, not to eligibility requirements for a loan or scholarship program.\n\nOption B suggests that the candidate will win because classifications by a state that are based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny. This option is also incorrect because the Supreme Court has held that classifications based on alienage do not necessarily violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOption C suggests that the candidate will lose because the statute promotes a compelling state interest. This option is incorrect because the state's interest in promoting citizenship and national security is not a compelling state interest that would justify denying the candidate the loan.\n\nOption D suggests that the candidate will lose because alienage classifications are not, per se, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. This option is correct because the Supreme Court has held that classifications based on alienage do not necessarily violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the candidate will lose the lawsuit and the state statute will not be found to be unconstitutional.",
