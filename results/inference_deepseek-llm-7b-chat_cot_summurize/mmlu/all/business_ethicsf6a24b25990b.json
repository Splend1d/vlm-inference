Attitudinal, Market equilibrium, Social pressures\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Attitudinal, Planned Behaviour, Social pressures.\n\nThe Theory of Market Equilibrium is not mentioned in the question, so option A is incorrect. Option C is incorrect because the Theory of Planned Behaviour is not mentioned. Option D is incorrect because the Theory of Market Equilibrium is not mentioned.\n\nThe Theory of Attitudinal Determinants, also known as the Theory of Planned Behaviour, is a cognitive model that attempts to explain consumer behaviour by examining the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control of individuals. This theory suggests that consumer behaviour is determined by the attitudes an individual holds towards a particular product, service, or behaviour. While this model attempts to explain consumer behaviour, it is important to note that it may oversimplify and overestimate individual behaviour.",
