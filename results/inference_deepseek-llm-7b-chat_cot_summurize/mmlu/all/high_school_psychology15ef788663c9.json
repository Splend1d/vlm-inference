It considers the extent to which extraneous variables are controlled and whether the results are due to the factors being studied (independent variables) or due to other, unrelated factors (confounding variables). In contrast, reliability refers to the consistency or stability of a measure over time or across different observers (D). External validity refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to populations or situations that are similar to the one studied (B). Inter-rater reliability refers to the degree of agreement between the ratings or assessments made by different raters (D).",
