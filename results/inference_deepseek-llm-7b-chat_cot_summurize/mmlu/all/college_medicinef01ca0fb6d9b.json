I and III and IV only\n\nassistant:The dependent variables in this experiment are the factors that the researcher manipulates or controls. These factors are the ones that the researcher wants to study and measure the effect of on the subjects' responses.\n\nIn this case, the dependent variables are the ones listed in option III: the number of facts the subjects can recall. This is the variable that the researcher wants to measure and study the effect of the other variables on.\n\nThe other variables mentioned in the question, such as the amount the subjects were compensated, the room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts, and the time the subjects were given to learn the facts, are the independent variables. These are the variables that the researcher manipulates or controls to study their effect on the dependent variable, the number of facts the subjects can recall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. III only.",
