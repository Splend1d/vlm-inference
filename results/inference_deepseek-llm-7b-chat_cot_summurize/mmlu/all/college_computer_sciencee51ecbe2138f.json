The order is the number of elements that are inserted into the hash table. We can calculate the order by finding the minimum bucket number that contains an element.\n\nLet's go through the elements one by one and find the minimum bucket number:\n\n1. Key 13 is inserted into bucket 0.\n2. Key 8 is inserted into bucket 1.\n3. Key 24 is inserted into bucket 2.\n4. Key 10 is inserted into bucket 3.\n5. Key 3 is inserted into bucket 4.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum bucket number that contains an element:\n\n- Bucket 0 contains key 13.\n- Bucket 1 contains keys 8 and 24.\n- Bucket 2 contains keys 10 and 3.\n\nThe minimum bucket number is 1.\n\nTherefore, the content of the bucket numbered 2 is key 10.
