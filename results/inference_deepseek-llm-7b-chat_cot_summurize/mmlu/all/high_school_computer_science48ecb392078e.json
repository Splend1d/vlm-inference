Here A = 10, B = 11, . . . ,F = 15. What is the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number, such as 14 or 3A?\n\nA. 32\nB. 225\nC. 255\nD. 256\n\nassistant:To find the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number, we need to find the maximum value that can be represented by a hexadecimal number with a leading \"1\" and a maximum value that can be represented by a hexadecimal number with a leading \"2\".\n\nA two-digit hexadecimal number can be written in the form xx, where x is a single-digit hexadecimal number (0-9 or A-F). The maximum value that can be represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number with a leading \"1\" is xx - 15 * (x - 9) (since x can be any single-digit hexadecimal number from 0 to 9, and the maximum value that can be represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number with a leading \"1\" is xx - 15 * (x - 9)).\n\nThe maximum value that can be represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number with a leading \"2\" is xx - 15 * (x - 10).\n\nWe need to find the largest value that can be represented by both of these values.\n\nThe maximum value that can be represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number with a leading \"1\" is 11 - 15 * (11 - 9) = 11 - 15 = -4.\n\nThe maximum value that can be represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number with a leading \"2\" is 12 - 15 * (12 - 10) = 12 - 15 = -3.\n\nThe largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number is the maximum value that can be represented by both of these values, which is -4 and -3. Therefore, the largest base-10 integer is -4.\n\nNone of the given options match the correct answer.",
