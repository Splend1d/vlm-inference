Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\nassistant:The neighbor is likely to prevail in the suit against the man. The neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving the shovel, and therefore the man owed the neighbor a duty of reasonable care. The man failed to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the fenced-in yard, which allowed the dog to attack the neighbor. Therefore, the neighbor should be able to prevail in the suit. Answer: C. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving the shovel.",
