As a result, his campaign manager, decides to mail to every registered Mexican voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running.

The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.\n\nassistant:A strong constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the statute would be one that establishes the importance of following the statutory requirements for ensuring fair and accurate elections. Option A, stating that voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections, does not directly address the issue of following statutory requirements or the fairness of the election process. Option B, stating that a state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the writing in of votes, does not directly address the issue of preprinted stickers and their compliance with the state statute. Option D, stating that the potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers, is not directly related to the interpretation of the state statute but rather to the use of preprinted stickers.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, states that since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner. This statement directly addresses the issue of following statutory requirements and the fairness of the election process. If the election officials' interpretation of the state statute is that voters must write in the candidate's name in ink, then it is necessary for all voters, regardless of their proficiency in English, to follow this requirement in order to ensure that the votes are counted accurately and fairly. This argument supports the election official's interpretation of the statute by emphasizing the importance of following statutory requirements for the fairness and accuracy of the election process.",
