If they do not have a common denominator, they cannot form a proportion.\n\nLet's break down the answer choices:\n\nA. 4 over 5 and 24 over 30: The common denominator is 30. They can form a proportion.\nB. 4 over 5 and 20 over 25: The common denominator is 25. They can form a proportion.\nC. 36 over 45 and 4 over 5: The common denominator is 45. They can form a proportion.\nD. 4 over 5 and 20 over 30: The common denominator is 15. They can form a proportion.\n\nTherefore, the pair of ratios that cannot form a proportion is 4 over 5 and 20 over 30.",
