She purchased a bottle of the shampoo from a drug store and used it without understanding the warning label. As a result, she suffered an allergic reaction, scalp irritation, and hair loss.\n\nThe manufacturer of the shampoo is not liable for the immigrant's injuries because she assumed the risk by not making the \"patch test. \" The warning label on the shampoo's box cover clearly advises consumers to make a \"patch test\" before applying the product. The warning is there to inform consumers about the potential risk of an allergic reaction to the chemicals contained in the shampoo.\n\nThe immigrant's inability to read or speak English is not a valid defense in a products liability lawsuit.
