This suggests that there was a significant genetic change between the early migrants and modern Native Americans. Therefore, it is likely that modern Native Americans are not descended from these early migrants, but rather from a different group of early migrants or a more recent migration.\n\nB. the \"skull\" haplogroup was not passed on is incorrect because the statement does not mention anything about a \"skull\" haplogroup.\nC. modern Native Americans have very different DNA is incorrect because the statement does not provide any information about the DNA of modern Native Americans.\nD. craniometrics is an unreliable method of tracking populations is incorrect because the statement does not provide any information about the reliability of craniometrics.",
