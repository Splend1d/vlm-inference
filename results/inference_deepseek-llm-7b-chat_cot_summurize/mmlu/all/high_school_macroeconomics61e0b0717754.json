This can lead to a decrease in the availability of credit and an increase in interest rates. Expansionary fiscal policy, which involves government spending or tax cuts, can increase interest rates due to the crowding-out effect.\n\nA. decreasing interest rates from contractionary fiscal policy is incorrect because contractionary fiscal policy involves cutting government spending or increasing taxes, which can lead to an increase in interest rates due to the crowding-out effect.\n\nC. increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy is also incorrect because expansionary monetary policy involves the central bank lowering interest rates to stimulate economic growth. This would not lead to an increase in interest rates due to the crowding-out effect.\n\nD. increasing unemployment rates from expansionary monetary policy is also incorrect because the crowding-out effect is not related to unemployment rates.",
