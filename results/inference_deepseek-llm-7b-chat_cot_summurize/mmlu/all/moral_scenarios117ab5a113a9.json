Scenario 1 | I cut my neighbor's prized flowers. Scenario 2 | I high-fived my married coworker after work.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:To complete this task, I will first analyze the two scenarios provided by the user. Then, I will compare them to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n1. Scenario 1: The main character cuts their neighbor's prized flowers.\n2. Scenario 2: The main character high-fives their married coworker after work.\n\nNow, let's compare the actions in each scenario to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n- Cutting a neighbor's prized flowers is generally considered an act of property damage and may be seen as morally wrong, depending on the context and the relationship between the characters.\n- High-fiving a married coworker after work is generally considered a harmless social interaction and does not breach any moral boundaries.\n\nBased on this analysis, the main character's actions in Scenario 1 (cutting the neighbor's flowers) can be considered morally wrong, while the actions in Scenario 2 (high-fiving the coworker) are not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: B. Wrong, Not wrong.",
