The driver allegedly hit another car in a parking lot and drove away without leaving proper insurance and contact information. A bystander wrote down her license plate number and called the police.

Hearsay is a statement that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the driver is offering her testimony to prove that she did not leave the scene of the accident until after she had inspected both cars and determined there was no damage. The bystander, who observed the accident and wrote down the license plate number, is not available to testify at trial, so the driver's testimony is inadmissible.",
