Distribution of income and goods on the basis of contribution or productivity does NOT describe how resources are allocated in a competitive market system. In a competitive market system, resources are allocated through voluntary market exchange between buyers and sellers, where prices are determined by supply and demand. Price signals guide producers on what, when, how, and for whom to produce goods and services. In contrast, active government ownership and direction of production is not a feature of a competitive market system.",
