No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\n\nThe driver's arrest for driving while her license was suspended is a proper arrest. The officer then had the legal right to search the car incident to the arrest. This means that the officer could search the car for any evidence that would support the arrest, such as weapons or additional evidence of a crime.\n\nA warrantless search that is incident to a proper arrest is generally considered lawful, as long as the search is limited to areas and objects that are immediately associated with the arrestee and the crime. In this case, the officer searched the car for drugs, which could be considered immediately associated with the crime of driving while her license was suspended.\n\nThe motion to suppress the cocaine is unlikely to be granted, as the search was deemed permissible under the circumstances.",
