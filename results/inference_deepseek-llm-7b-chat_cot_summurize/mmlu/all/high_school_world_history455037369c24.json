The person who has understanding, mindfulness, and purity reaches a place from where they are not born again.\n\nThe Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation is also based on the concept of karma, where one's actions in a previous life determine their rebirth in a new life. This is similar to the Hindu belief that one's actions determine their destiny.\n\nB. is incorrect because the excerpt does not mention anything about a heavenly existence after death.\nC. is incorrect because the excerpt does not mention anything about rejecting the validity of all gods.\nD. is incorrect because the excerpt does not mention anything about mandating unquestioning obedience to the priestly class.",
