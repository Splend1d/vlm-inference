Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character sets the whole national park's valley on fire in a watercolor painting. This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves causing harm to a natural environment and potentially endangering lives.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character calls the police on a non-violent lady. While this action may be seen as controversial or morally ambiguous, it does not necessarily involve doing something clearly morally wrong, as the lady may have committed a crime or pose a threat to others.",
