Alice and Bob are worried that an adversary might compromise one of their computers today, while they are taking the 6.858 final exam, and would then be able to decrypt those messages. Which of the following security properties can address Alice and Bob\u2019s concern?\n\nA. Authentication.\nB. Deniability.\nC. Forward secrecy\nD. Backward secrecy.\n\nassistant:A. Authentication.\n\nAuthentication ensures that the recipient of a message is who they claim to be. This is important in cases where Alice and Bob are worried about an adversary compromising their computers while they are taking the final exam. Authentication would prevent an adversary from impersonating Alice or Bob and decrypting their messages.\n\nB. Deniability.\n\nDeniability refers to the inability to deny knowledge or responsibility for a particular action. This property is not relevant to the situation described, as it does not address the issue of message confidentiality or integrity.\n\nC. Forward secrecy.\n\nForward secrecy refers to the ability of a cryptographic system to maintain confidentiality even if an attacker compromises the key used to encrypt the messages. While this property is important for protecting the confidentiality of messages, it does not address the concern of an adversary compromising Alice and Bob's computers while they are taking the exam.\n\nD. Backward secrecy.\n\nBackward secrecy refers to the ability of a cryptographic system to maintain confidentiality even if an attacker has access to a large amount of encrypted data from the past. This property is not relevant to the situation described, as it does not address the concern of an adversary compromising Alice and Bob's computers while they are taking the exam.",
