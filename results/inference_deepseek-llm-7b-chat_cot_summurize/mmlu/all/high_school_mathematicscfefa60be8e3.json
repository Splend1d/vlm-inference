If 2 is added to the second term and 20 is added to the third term, the three resulting numbers form a geometric progression. What is the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression?\n\nA. 2\nB. 1\nC. 9\nD. 16\n\nassistant:Let the common difference of the arithmetic progression be $d$. Then the three terms are 9, 9 + d, and 9 + 2d.\n\nWhen 2 is added to the second term and 20 is added to the third term, the resulting numbers form a geometric progression. Let the common ratio of this geometric progression be $r$. Then the three resulting numbers are (9 + d) + 2, (9 + d) \\* r, and (9 + 2d) \\* r.\n\nWe are given that (9 + d) + 2 = (9 + d) \\* r and (9 + 2d) \\* r = (9 + d) \\* r + 20.\n\nSimplifying these equations, we have:\n\n1) d + 2 = r \\* (9 + d)\n2) 9 \\* r + 2d \\* r = 9 \\* d + 20\n\nSince 1) is a linear equation and 2) is a quadratic equation, we can solve them separately.\n\nFrom equation 1), we can solve for r:\n\nr = (d + 2) / (9 + d)\n\nSubstituting this expression for r into equation 2), we get:\n\n9 \\* ((d + 2) / (9 + d)) \\* (9 + d) + 2d \\* ((d + 2) / (9 + d)) = 9 \\* d + 20\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n9 \\* ((d + 2) / (9 + d)) + 2d \\* ((d + 2) / (9 + d)) = 9 \\* d + 20\n\nMultiplying through by (9 + d), we get:\n\n9 \\* (d + 2) + 2 \\* (d + 2) = 9 \\* d + 20 \\* (9 + d)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we have:\n\n18 \\* d + 36 = 9 \\* d + 198 + 20 \\* d\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n39 \\* d + 36 = 198 + 20 \\* d\n\nSubtracting 39 \\* d from both sides, we get:\n\n36 = 198 + 20 \\* d - 39 \\* d\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n36 = 108 + d \\* (20 - 39)\n\n36 = 108 + d \\* (-19)\n\n36 = 108 - 19 \\* d\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = (108 - 36) / 19 = 72 / 19 \u2248 3.78\n\nNow, we can find the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression:\n\nr = (d + 2) / (9 + d) = (72/19 + 2) / (9 + 72/19) \u2248 0.466\n\nFinally, we can find the third term of the geometric progression:\n\n(9 + 2d) \\* r \u2248 9 \\* 0.466 \u2248 4.094\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is approximately 4.094. However, since the answer choices are whole numbers, this value is not among the options.",
