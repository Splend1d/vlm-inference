So, it is not a valid option.\n\nB. 0.0261: This value is larger than the upper bound of the given range (0.038). So, it is not a valid option.\n\nC. 0.049: This value is larger than the upper bound of the given range (0.038). So, it is not a valid option.\n\nD. 0.052: This value is between the lower and upper bounds of the given range (0.0051 \u2264 x \u2264 0.038). Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is D. 0.052.",
