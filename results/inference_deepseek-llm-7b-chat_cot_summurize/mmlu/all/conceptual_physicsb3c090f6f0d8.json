The atomic number of the resulting element is changed by\n\nA. zero\nB. minus 1\nC. minus 2\nD. plus 1\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\n1. An alpha particle is a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons).\n2. When the element emits an alpha particle, its atomic number (Z) is reduced by 2.\n3. A beta particle (or electron) has no effect on the atomic number.\n4. The element then emits 2 beta particles in succession.\n5. The atomic number of the resulting element after 2 beta particles are emitted remains the same.\n\nNow let's apply the information to the answer choices:\n\nA. The atomic number (Z) is reduced by 2, so the change is 2.\nB. The change is 0, which is incorrect.\nC. The change is 1, which is incorrect.\nD. The change is 1, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The atomic number of the resulting element is changed by zero.",
