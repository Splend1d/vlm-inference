The mind is very active, but the body is in a state of paralysis.\n\nREM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep, is a stage of sleep characterized by rapid brain activity, vivid dreaming, and temporary paralysis of the muscles, a condition known as atonia. This atonia helps to prevent the body from acting out the dreams, which would be dangerous if the individual was physically moving while dreaming. This phenomenon, known as REM sleep paralysis, can occur during the transition between REM sleep and wakefulness, and is often accompanied by vivid visual hallucinations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while REM sleep is characterized by changes in brain waves, it is not necessarily associated with a shift from alpha to delta waves over the course of a night's sleep.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while people may act out their dreams during REM sleep, this is not a defining characteristic of REM sleep.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the idea that people will try to increase REM sleep if deprived of it for a period of time is not supported by scientific research.",
