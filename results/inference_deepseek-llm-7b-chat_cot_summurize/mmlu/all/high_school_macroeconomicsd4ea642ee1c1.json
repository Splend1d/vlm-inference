Decreases.\n\nDuring a deep prolonged recession in Japan, there would likely be a decrease in U.S. net exports. This is because when a country's economy is in recession, it typically has a negative impact on the consumption of goods and services, leading to reduced demand for imports. Therefore, there would likely be a decrease in U.S. net exports to Japan.\n\nAdditionally, a deep prolonged recession in Japan would likely lead to a decrease in the value of the yen. This is because a recession typically causes a decrease in the country's economic growth and the overall value of its currency. As a result, the value of the yen would likely decrease, making it more expensive for foreign investors to buy Japanese goods and services. This could lead to an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar, as the U.S. dollar would be stronger compared to the weaker yen. However, this is not necessarily a direct cause-and-effect relationship and there are many other factors that could influence the exchange rates of these two currencies.",
