What will be the eighth number in the pattern?\n\nA. 160\nB. 240\nC. 320\nD. 640\n\nassistant:To find the eighth number in the pattern, we can use the formula:\n\nnext number = previous number + (previous number * increment)\n\nThe user provided the first three numbers in the pattern: 20, 40, 60. We can see that the increment between each number is 20.\n\nTo find the eighth number, we can plug in the values:\n\nnext number = 60 + (60 * 20) = 60 + 1200 = 1260\n\nSo, the eighth number in the pattern is 1260. None of the answer choices match this. Please check the pattern or the calculation.",
