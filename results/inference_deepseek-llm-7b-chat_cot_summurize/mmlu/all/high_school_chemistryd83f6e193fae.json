That gas is most likely\n\nA. CO2\nB. CH4\nC. C5H12\nD. C8H18\n\nassistant:To determine which gas is most likely, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Helium effuses through a pinhole 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas.\n\nSince we know that helium (He) has the fastest effusion rate among all gases, we can compare the given number (5.33) to the effusion rates of the other gases.\n\nEffusion rate of Helium (He): 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas\n\nEffusion rates of the other gases:\nA. CO2: 2.67 times slower than He\nB. CH4: 2.21 times slower than He\nC. C5H12: 1.24 times slower than He\nD. C8H18: 0.59 times slower than He\n\nNow, let's find the gas with the highest effusion rate relative to helium:\n\n- CO2 (2.67 times slower than He)\n- CH4 (2.21 times slower than He)\n- C5H12 (1.24 times slower than He)\n- C8H18 (0.59 times slower than He)\n\nBased on this information, the gas with the highest effusion rate relative to helium is:\n\nB.
