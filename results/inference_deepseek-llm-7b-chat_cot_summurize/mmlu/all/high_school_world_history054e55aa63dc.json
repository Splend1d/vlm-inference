Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population.\n\nIn the passage, Mao Zedong discusses the growing polarization in the countryside due to the spontaneous forces of capitalism. He argues that the only solution to this problem is to bring about a new basis for the worker-peasant alliance by implementing a socialist transformation of agriculture, which would eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside. This would ensure that all rural people become increasingly well off together.\n\nOption A is not relevant because the passage does not discuss liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest.\n\nOption C is not relevant because the passage does not discuss policies intended to hasten industrialization.\n\nOption D is not relevant because the passage does not promote capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population. Instead, it advocates for a socialist transformation of agriculture and the elimination of capitalist-oriented economic systems in the countryside.",
