It undergoes several changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormonal fluctuations. The menstrual cycle is typically divided into three phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. \n\nDuring the follicular phase, the pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the growth of multiple ovarian follicles containing eggs. The estrogen levels in the body begin to rise, causing the endometrium to thicken and prepare for potential implantation of a fertilized egg.\n\nAt ovulation, the dominant follicle ruptures, releasing the egg into the fallopian tube. The surge in estrogen levels leads to the release of progesterone, which helps maintain the endometrium's thickness and prepares it for potential implantation. The endometrium continues to thicken during this phase.\n\nIf fertilization and implantation do not occur, the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease, causing the endometrium to shed (menses) as it returns to its pre-ovulation state. If fertilization and implantation do occur, the embryo will begin to develop, and the endometrium will continue to thicken and provide a nourishing environment for the growing fetus.\n\nIn summary, the endometrium grows and thickens during the luteal phase, which follows ovulation and precedes menstruation.",
