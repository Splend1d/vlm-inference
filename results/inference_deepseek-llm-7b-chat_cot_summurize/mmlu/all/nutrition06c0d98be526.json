Reduce muscle mass and strength\n\nassistant:Additional dietary protein may not necessarily have the same effect on everyone. However, based on scientific studies, consuming more protein may help reduce muscle mass and strength. This is because excessive protein consumption can lead to increased nitrogen waste and metabolic stress on the kidneys, which can ultimately result in muscle loss. However, it is important to maintain a balanced diet and consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dietary advice.",
