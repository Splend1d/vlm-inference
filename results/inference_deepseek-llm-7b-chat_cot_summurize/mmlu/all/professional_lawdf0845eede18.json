According to the text, \"the defendant will probably be A. convicted, because her knowledge that her exboyfriend was a federal agent is not a material element of the crime.\" This is because her knowledge of her ex-boyfriend's identity as a federal agent would be a factor that would make the conspiracy to assault him unlawful. Therefore, she would be convicted for conspiring to commit an assault on a federal officer.",
