You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The mean of 7 numbers is 15. When an 8th number is added, the mean decreases to 12. What is the 8th number?\n\nA. \u201312\nB. \u20139\nC. 0\nD. 8\n\nassistant:Let the sum of the first 7 numbers be S. Then, the sum of the 8 numbers is S + the 8th number. The mean of the 8 numbers is (S + the 8th number) / 8, which is (15 + 8) / 8 = 23 / 8 = 2.875.\n\nWhen the 8th number is added, the mean decreases to 12. So, we have:\n\n(S + the 8th number) / 8 = 12\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8 gives:\n\nS + the 8th number = 96\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the 8 numbers is S + the 8th number = 96. The mean of the 8 numbers is 12, so the sum of the 8 numbers is 8 * 12 = 96.\n\nTherefore, the 8th number is S - (96 - S) = 0.\n\nThe answer is C. 0.",
