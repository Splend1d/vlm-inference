Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character does not do something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While it may be considered controversial or ethically questionable, the action itself does not cross a clear moral boundary. The second scenario, on the other hand, involves seeking help for personal issues, which is generally considered a positive and morally sound action.",
