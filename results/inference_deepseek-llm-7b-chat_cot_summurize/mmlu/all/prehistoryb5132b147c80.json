A chiefdom is a social organization in which a single individual, the chief, holds a dominant position over other members of the group and exercises control over resources. This is more complex than a tribe, which is a smaller, more loosely organized group without a central authority figure. However, a chiefdom is still less complex than a state, which is a larger, more complex political entity with a more complex system of government and administration. The other options (archaic state, egalitarian society, and democratic state) are not appropriate comparisons in this context.",
