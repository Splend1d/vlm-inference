It is a spiral-shaped structure that separates the two fluid-filled chambers of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani. The basilar membrane is lined with hair cells, which are sensitive to changes in the pressure waves caused by sound waves. These hair cells convert the mechanical energy from the sound waves into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the auditory nerve and processed by the brain. The basilar membrane's shape and stiffness allow it to vibrate at different frequencies, depending on the pitch of the sound. This process is known as the cochlear's binaural hearing mechanism.",
