The decomposition of the acid lowers its concentration over time.

It is impossible to determine.\n\nassistant:The decomposition of one-fourth of the hypochlorous acid will have no effect on the agreement between the endpoint of the titration and the equivalence point.\n\nIn a titration, the endpoint of the titration is the point at which the reacting substances have been completely neutralized. The equivalence point is the point at which the reacting substances have been neutralized completely and the solution has reached its maximum concentration of a reagent.\n\nThe decomposition of hypochlorous acid will not affect the endpoint of the titration, as it occurs after the endpoint. The decomposition of hypochlorous acid will also not affect the equivalence point, as it is not a reactant in the titration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The endpoint would still remain near the ideal equivalence point.",
