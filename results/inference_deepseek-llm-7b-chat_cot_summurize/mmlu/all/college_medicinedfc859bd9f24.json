DNA consists of two types of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of the molecule. These nucleotides are:\n\nA. Purine: Adenine (A)\nB. Pyrimidine: Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G)\nC. Deoxyribose: A sugar that is found in DNA\nD. Amino acid: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Amino acid.",
