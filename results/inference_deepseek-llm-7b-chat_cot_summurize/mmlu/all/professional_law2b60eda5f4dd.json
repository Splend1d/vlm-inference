Larceny is the crime of stealing or taking something without permission. In this case, the woman took the diamond necklace from the department store, intending to keep it for herself. This is a form of larceny, as she did not have permission to take the necklace and intended to keep it. Attempted larceny, false pretenses, and embezzlement are also related to theft, but in different ways. Attempted larceny is when someone tries to steal something but is caught before they can take it. False pretenses is when someone lies about their intentions in order to take something. Embezzlement is when someone steals money or property that they have access to in their job. However, in this case, the woman took an actual item, so larceny is the most accurate charge.",
