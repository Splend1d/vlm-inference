Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:D. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character buys their son test answers to help him at school. This action is morally wrong because it involves cheating and undermines the integrity of the educational system.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character likes to park in their own driveway without asking their neighbors. This action is not morally wrong because it does not harm or inconvenience anyone else. It is a personal preference and does not violate any laws or societal norms.",
