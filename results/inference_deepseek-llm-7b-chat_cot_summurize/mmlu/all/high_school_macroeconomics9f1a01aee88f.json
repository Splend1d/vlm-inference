The purchase of bonds\nB. The sale of bonds\nC. An increase in taxes\nD. An increase in government spending\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's first understand the terms and concepts related to monetary policy and contractionary monetary policy.\n\nMonetary policy is the actions taken by a central bank to influence the supply of money and credit in the economy. These actions aim to maintain price stability and promote sustainable economic growth.\n\nContractionary monetary policy is a policy aimed at slowing down the economy by tightening the money supply and increasing interest rates. This is done to control inflation and prevent overheating of the economy.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The purchase of bonds: This is expansionary monetary policy, as it increases the money supply by injecting cash into the economy.\n\nB. The sale of bonds: This is contractionary monetary policy, as it decreases the money supply by draining cash from the economy.\n\nC. An increase in taxes: This is a fiscal policy, not a monetary policy. It is not related to the money supply or interest rates.\n\nD. An increase in government spending: This is expansionary monetary policy, as it increases the money supply by increasing the demand for goods and services.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. The sale of bonds, which is a contractionary monetary policy.",
