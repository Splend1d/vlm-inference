The logging company's selling of the timber would be considered a commercial purpose, and thus, the resident would have the right to re-enter and terminate the grant to the state. The fact that the director granted a logging company the privilege to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract would not affect the resident's right to terminate the grant. Therefore, the resident would succeed in the ejectment action, and the state would be required to return the tract to the resident.",
