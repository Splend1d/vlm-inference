To find the GCF of 252 and 96, we can start by finding their prime factors.\n\n252 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7\n96 = 2^5 * 3\n\nNow, we take the common prime factors and find the highest power of each prime factor:\n2^2 * 3 = 12\n\nSo, the greatest common factor of 252 and 96 is 12. The correct answer is option D.",
