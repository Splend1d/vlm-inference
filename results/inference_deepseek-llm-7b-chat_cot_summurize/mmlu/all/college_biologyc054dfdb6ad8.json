The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because\n\nA. on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry\nB. the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species\nC. on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own\nD. the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species. This means that the host bird species is able to survive and reproduce despite raising a cuckoo fledgling, so the genes that allow this behavior to occur remain in the gene pool.\n\nA is incorrect because the host birds' response to the loud begging cues does not necessarily allow them to rear their own young efficiently. They may still be spending energy on raising a fledgling that is not their own.\n\nC is incorrect because it suggests that little energy is spent on raising any fledgling, but this does not explain why the duped bird's genes would remain in the gene pool.\n\nD is incorrect because it suggests that the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would be reduced if the host bird species were not able to raise an interloper of another species. This does not explain why the genes of the host bird species would remain in the gene pool.",
