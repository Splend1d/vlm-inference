The statute does not provide any exceptions for cases where the perpetrator was intoxicated at the time of the crime. The statute specifically mentions premeditation and malice as the elements required to commit first-degree murder, and involuntary manslaughter as the offense committed in the commission of an unlawful act.\n\nIntoxication may be relevant to the sentencing phase of the trial, if the defense argues that the husband's intoxication should be considered a mitigating factor in determining his sentence. However, it is not relevant to the charges he faces under the homicide statute. Therefore, the evidence of the husband's intoxication would not be admissible in court.",
