False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: For n > 1, the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n.\n\nThis statement is true. To show this, we need to verify that the set satisfies the four group axioms:\n\n1. Closure: For any two elements a and b in the set, their product a * b (mod n) is also in the set.\n2. Associativity: For any three elements a, b, and c in the set, (a * b * c) mod n is the same as (a * (b * c)) mod n.\n3. Identity element: There exists an element 1 in the set such that for any element a in the set, a * 1 mod n = a.\n4. Inverse element: For each element a in the set, there exists an element a^-1 in the set such that a * a^-1 mod n = 1 and a^-1 * a mod n = 1.\n\nWe can verify these properties for the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} under multiplication modulo n.\n\nStatement 2: There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1.\n\nThis statement is false. The only integer x that satisfies this equation mod 100 is 99, but 99 * 63 mod 100 = 99 * 1 mod 100 = 99, not 1. Therefore, there is no integer x that satisfies this equation.",
