After the exercise, the body needs to replenish its supply of phosphocreatine to be able to continue performing at a high level. This process is called resynthesis, and it normally takes about 10 seconds. This is because the body is able to quickly produce new phosphocreatine through a process called phosphocreatine resynthesis.",
