The child, because the wife was negligent in failing to seek proper prenatal care.\n\nassistant:C. The child, because a child, if born alive, is permitted to maintain an action for the consequences of prenatal injuries.\n\nThe correct answer is C. The child, because a child, if born alive, is permitted to maintain an action for the consequences of prenatal injuries. This means that the child can bring a claim against the physician for malpractice in not administering a pregnancy test to the woman and prescribing tetracycline, which caused the discoloration of his teeth.\n\nA. The physician is incorrect because an unborn child does have legal rights stemming from conduct that occurred before birth. This is known as \"prospective cause of action,\" which means that a child born after the conduct can bring a claim for injuries suffered in utero.\n\nB. The physician is incorrect because a duty of care is owed to an unborn child not in existence at the time medical treatment is rendered. Even though the unborn child was not yet born, the physician owed a duty of care to the pregnant woman, who was the patient at the time.\n\nD. The wife is incorrect because the physician was not negligent in not administering a pregnancy test to the woman. The physician had diagnosed her as infertile and was treating her for the flu, not suspecting that she was pregnant.",
