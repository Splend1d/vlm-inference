Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:I'm sorry, but I am not able to access real-time information or provide an accurate analysis of the US moral standards as of 2020. I can only provide general information and advice based on the information provided to me.\n\nIn the context of the two scenarios you've given, I would say that in Scenario 1, the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong. Adding a sprinkle of spit to the coffee they made for others is considered a form of contamination and is generally considered unhygienic and morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 2, the main character is not doing anything clearly morally wrong. Telling the authorities about the missing girl mainly because they knew the girl's folks were distraught does not necessarily mean that the main character is doing something morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as an act of moral responsibility in some cases.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong",
