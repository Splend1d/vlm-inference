When the unemployment rate rises, it means that there is less demand for labor, and the economy is operating at a lower potential output. This decrease in the unemployment rate is caused by the change in the aggregate supply of labor, which affects the level of potential GDP.\n\nB. the retirement age is lowered does not necessarily affect potential GDP. It may have an effect on the labor force participation rate, which could potentially affect the output in the short-run. However, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on potential GDP, as it is mainly determined by the availability of resources and technology.\n\nC. tariffs protecting domestic jobs are eliminated. Tariffs are a type of tax that a country imposes on imported goods, which can protect domestic industries and jobs. If these tariffs are eliminated, it may lead to a decrease in the price of imported goods, which could lead to an increase in consumer demand and potentially raise the output in the short-run. However, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on potential GDP, as it is mainly determined by the availability of resources and technology.\n\nD. more immigration is allowed. Immigration can increase the labor force participation rate and potentially increase the output in the short-run. However, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on potential GDP, as it is mainly determined by the availability of resources and technology.\n\nIn conclusion, potential GDP will fall ceteris paribus if the unemployment rate rises, as it is mainly determined by the availability of resources and technology.",
