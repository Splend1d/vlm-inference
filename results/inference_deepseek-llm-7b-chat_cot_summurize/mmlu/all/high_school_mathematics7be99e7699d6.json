Applying this identity, we have \\[\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{5}=\\binom{24}{5}.\\] Subtracting the left side from the right side, we get \\[\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{5}=\\binom{24}{5}-\\binom{24}{4}.\\] Now, we can rewrite this as \\[\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{5}=\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{5}.\\] Using the identity $\\binom{n}{r}+\\binom{n}{r+1}=\\binom{n+1}{r+1}$, we can rewrite the right side as \\[\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{5}=\\binom{23+1}{4+1}.\\] Therefore, we have \\[\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{5}=\\binom{23+1}{4+1}.\\] Simplifying, we get \\[\\binom{23}{4}+\\binom{23}{5}=\\binom{24}{5}.\\] This equation holds true for any value of $k$, so the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{24}$.\nThe answer is: 24",
