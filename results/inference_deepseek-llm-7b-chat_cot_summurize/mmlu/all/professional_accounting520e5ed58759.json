Customers who have credit or zero balances with the client.\nB. Responses that were mailed rather than faxed to the auditor.\nC. Accounts receivable that have been classified as uncollectible.\nD. Payments mailed to the client that have not been recorded.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Accounts receivable that have been classified as uncollectible.\n\nExplanation: Accounts receivable that have been categorized initially by an auditor as \u201a\u00c4\ufffdexceptions\u201a\u00c4\ufffd most likely could be due to accounts receivable that have been classified as uncollectible. This is because uncollectible accounts are those that have been written off as bad debts and are unlikely to be collected.\n\nOption A is incorrect because customers who have credit or zero balances with the client do not necessarily affect the accounts receivable that have been categorized as \u201a\u00c4\ufffdexceptions\u201a\u00c4\ufffd by the auditor.\n\nOption B is incorrect because responses that were mailed rather than faxed to the auditor do not directly relate to accounts receivable that have been categorized as \u201a\u00c4\ufffdexceptions\u201a\u00c4\ufffd by the auditor.\n\nOption D is incorrect because payments mailed to the client that have not been recorded do not directly affect the accounts receivable that have been categorized as \u201a\u00c4\ufffdexceptions\u201a\u00c4\ufffd by the auditor.",
