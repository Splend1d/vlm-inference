Failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\n\nIn high intensity exercise, the body requires a large amount of energy to perform the necessary physical activities. The primary source of energy for the body is ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is produced by the cells through a process called cellular respiration. When the body's demand for ATP exceeds the supply, it leads to fatigue. Therefore, the failure of the ATP supply to match the demand is a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a fall in the cell concentration of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is not a cause of fatigue. ADP is a byproduct of ATP breakdown, and its concentration does not directly affect fatigue.\n\nOption B is also incorrect. Inhibition of ATP production does not directly cause fatigue. ATP production is essential for energy production, but other factors such as ATP supply and demand also play a role in fatigue.\n\nOption D is not a correct answer because it is not a cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. Lack of skill may affect performance, but it is not related to fatigue.",
