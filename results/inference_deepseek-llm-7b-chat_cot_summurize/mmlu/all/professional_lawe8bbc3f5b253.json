A businessman customer came and sat beside him. They did not know each other. The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. \"Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?\n\nA. Voluntary Manslaughter\nB. First Degree Murder\nC. Second Degree Murder\nD. Involuntary Manslaughter\n\nassistant:The defendant is most likely guilty of Involuntary Manslaughter. In this case, the drunk man did not have the specific intent to premeditate and murder the businessman, but his action (shooting the businessman) was a result of his intoxicated state. This falls under the category of Involuntary Manslaughter, where a person unintentionally causes the death of another through criminal negligence or reckless behavior.\n\nVoluntary Manslaughter, on the other hand, would involve the drunk man premeditating the act and committing it with the specific intent to kill. First Degree Murder is reserved for cases where the defendant intentionally premeditated and planned the murder, which is not present in this scenario. Second Degree Murder involves the lesser degree of premeditation and intent, but the killing was not as deliberate as in First Degree Murder.\n\nInvoluntary Manslaughter, as a result, is the most fitting crime under these circumstances, as the defendant did not intend to cause the death of the businessman, but his actions (being drunk and shooting the businessman) resulted in the death.",
