Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.\n\nassistant:All of the options listed can be used as a part of an Early Warning Score (EWS) assessment. However, option D is the most comprehensive and accurate description of patients who should be assessed using an EWS.\n\nAn EWS is a tool used to monitor and assess a patient's condition and risk of deterioration. It is often used in hospitals to identify patients who are at risk of serious illness or complications. The EWS is calculated based on a range of clinical factors, including age, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature, and is used to identify patients who require urgent attention or intervention.\n\nOption D includes patients who are acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively, which means that patients who are undergoing surgery or recovering from surgery may also benefit from an EWS assessment. Additionally, option D also includes patients who have undergone major surgery, which suggests that patients who have undergone more complex or invasive procedures may be at a higher risk of complications and therefore may require an EWS assessment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the EWS is not intended to replace clinical judgement or replace other risk assessment tools. It is just one tool that can be used in conjunction with other clinical assessments to monitor and manage a patient's condition.",
