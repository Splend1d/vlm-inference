S\nB. Se\nC. I\nD. Ga\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first identify the elements listed and then determine which one is a metal based on their atomic number.\n\nElements:\nA. S\nB. Se\nC. I\nD. Ga\n\nAtomic numbers:\nA. S - 16\nB. Se - 34\nC. I - 53\nD. Ga - 31\n\nNow, I will determine which atomic number corresponds to a metal:\n\nMetals are elements with a closed-shell electronic configuration. Based on this, the atomic numbers of metals are typically in the 20-30 range.\n\nComparing the atomic numbers of the given elements:\n\nA. S - 16 (non-metal)\nB. Se - 34 (non-metal)\nC. I - 53 (non-metal)\nD. Ga - 31 (metal)\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Ga, which is a metal.",
