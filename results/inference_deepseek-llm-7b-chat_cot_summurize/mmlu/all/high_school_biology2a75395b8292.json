Which information would best help distinguish between an explanation based on homology versus one based on convergent evolution?\n\nA. The two species live at great distance from each other.\nB.

The sizes of the structures in adult members of both species are similar in size.\nD. Both species are well adapted to their particular environments.\n\nassistant:B. The two species share many proteins in common, and the nucleotide sequences that code for these proteins are almost identical.\n\nThis answer is correct because shared proteins and nucleotide sequences are strong indicators of homology, which suggests that the structures evolved from a common ancestor. The other options do not necessarily distinguish between homology and convergent evolution:\n\nA. The two species living at great distances from each other may suggest independent evolution, but it doesn't necessarily indicate homology or convergent evolution.\n\nC. Similar sizes of the structures in adult members of both species may suggest convergent evolution, as it implies that two different species independently evolved similar structures for the same function.\n\nD. Both species being well adapted to their environments does not provide enough information to distinguish between homology and convergent evolution.",
