The Department of Labor removes the need for workers to pass an exam before they can work in this field.\n\nassistant:A. More students graduate with the necessary skills for this labor market.\n\nExplanation: In a competitive labor market, if there are more students with the necessary skills to fill the available jobs, the supply of labor increases, which can lead to an increase in the market wage as employers compete for the available workers.\n\nB. Demand for the good produced by this labor is stronger.\nC. The price of a complementary resource increases.\nD. The Department of Labor removes the need for workers to pass an exam before they can work in this field.\n\nThese options do not necessarily increase the market wage. Option B could lead to an increase in demand and potentially an increase in the market wage, but it's not guaranteed. Option C could increase the market wage if the increase in the price of the complementary resource is passed on to the consumers, but it's not directly related to the labor supply or demand in the market. Option D might decrease the barrier to entry for certain workers, but it doesn't necessarily increase the market wage.",
