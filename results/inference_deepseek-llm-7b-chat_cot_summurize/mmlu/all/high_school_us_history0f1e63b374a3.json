Containment policy toward the Soviet Union\n\nassistant:President George Herbert Walker Bush's \"new world order\" most directly resembles Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. In his speech to a Joint Session of Congress on September 11, 1990, President Bush discussed the need for a more cooperative and peaceful world, in which nations, regardless of their geographic location or political orientation, could work together to resolve conflicts and promote justice. This vision of a more cooperative world order aligns with Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which he proposed in January 1918 as a blueprint for peace after World War I. Wilson's Fourteen Points emphasized the importance of international cooperation, the establishment of a League of Nations to maintain peace and security, and the creation of a more democratic and just global order. Like Bush's new world order, Wilson's Fourteen Points aimed to foster cooperation among nations and promote a more peaceful and just world.",
