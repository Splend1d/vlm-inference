Collagen\nB. Heparin\nC. Lipocyte\nD. Melanin\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Collagen.\n\nCollagen is a structural, fibrous protein found in the dermis, which is the middle layer of the skin. It provides support and structure to the skin, and is responsible for its elasticity and firmness.\n\nHeparin is a blood thinner that is produced by the body's liver and found in the blood, not in the dermis.\n\nLipocytes are cells that produce and store fats in the skin, but they are not proteins.\n\nMelanin is a pigment that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color, but it is not a structural protein found in the dermis.",
