A duplication.\n\nA mutation in sickle-cell disease is caused by a change in the DNA sequence that codes for a protein. This change results in the production of a protein with an abnormal structure, which leads to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells. This change occurs due to a duplication of a portion of the gene, which results in an extra copy of a segment of the gene being present in the DNA. This extra copy causes the change in the protein structure and leads to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells.",
