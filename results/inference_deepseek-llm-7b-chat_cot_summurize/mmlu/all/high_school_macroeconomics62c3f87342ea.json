Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreases.\n\nThe reason behind this is that when consumption spending (C) increases, it leads to an increase in real GDP. This is because more goods and services are being produced and consumed, leading to an expansion in the economy.\n\nAt the same time, this increase in consumption spending can lead to an increase in the price level. This is because businesses are producing more goods and services, which can lead to a shortage of certain goods and a rise in prices.\n\nFinally, an increase in consumption spending can lead to an initial increase in unemployment, but in the long run, it can lead to a decrease in unemployment. This is because as businesses produce more goods and services, they need more workers to do so. This can lead to job creation and a decrease in unemployment.",
