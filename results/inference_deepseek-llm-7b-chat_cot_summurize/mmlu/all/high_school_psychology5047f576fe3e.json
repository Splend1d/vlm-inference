A teacher has chemistry classes with the same number of students at 8:30 A.M. and 1:00 P.M., and volunteers to participate with her classes. A major problem in this study would be\n\nA. poor replication\nB. lack of a hypothesis\nC. confounding variables\nD. difficulty in obtaining informed consent\n\nassistant:To complete this task, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the context: Javier wants to study the effects on achievement of taking a course in chemistry in the afternoon, rather than in the morning. There are chemistry classes with the same number of students at 8:30 A.M. and 1:00 P.M., and a teacher volunteers to participate with her classes.\n\n2. Identify the task: The user wants me to find the major problem in this study.\n\n3. Analyze the options:\n   A. poor replication\n   B. lack of a hypothesis\n   C. confounding variables\n   D. difficulty in obtaining informed consent\n\n4. Determine the best answer: The major problem in this study would be confounding variables. The reason is that confounding variables can affect the results of the study and make it difficult to determine whether the course taken in the afternoon or the morning had a significant impact on achievement.\n\n5. Provide the answer: The major problem in this study would be confounding variables.",
