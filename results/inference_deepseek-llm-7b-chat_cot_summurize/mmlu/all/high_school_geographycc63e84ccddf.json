Multiplier effect\nB. Rank-size rule\nC. Central place theory\nD. Burgess's sector model\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Rank-size rule.\n\nThe Rank-size rule is a concept in urban hierarchies that states that the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy. This means that as a city rises in the hierarchy, its population decreases, and as it falls in the hierarchy, its population increases.\n\nA. Multiplier effect is a term used in economics to describe how the production of a good or service increases as the initial inputs increase. It does not relate to the urban hierarchy model.\n\nC. Central place theory is a concept that describes how the location of a city in an urban hierarchy affects the distribution of resources and goods. It does not directly relate to the Rank-size rule.\n\nD. Burgess's sector model is a model that describes how cities develop and expand over time. It does not directly relate to the Rank-size rule.",
