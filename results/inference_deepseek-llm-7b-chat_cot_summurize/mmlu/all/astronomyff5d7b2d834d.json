The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.\n\nassistant:B. You will see two distinct stars.\n\nIf the angular separation of the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes, it means that your eyes can still distinguish the two stars as separate objects. The angular resolution of the human eye is around 1/7 degree, which means that the eyes can distinguish objects that are separated by less than 1/7 degree. In this case, the angular separation of the two stars would need to be smaller than 1/7 degree for your eyes to be able to distinguish them as separate objects. Therefore, the correct answer is B. You will see two distinct stars.",
