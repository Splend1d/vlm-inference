Before the swearing-in ceremony, however, the graduate received a letter from the bar examiners indicating that his admission would be delayed until a character fitness investigation had been completed. The examiners also requested information as to whether the graduate had ever been arrested, convicted, or placed on probation for a criminal offense. The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney. In addition, the letter provided detailed information about the facts related to the offense. As a result, the examiners hired a special investigator, to look into the matter. As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed.

The sealing of juvenile records prevents the bar examiners from fully investigating the graduate's background and making an informed decision about his admission to the bar.\n\nThe state statute requiring the sealing of juvenile records is therefore unconstitutional under the principle of equal protection of the laws, as it applies equally to all individuals and restricts the bar examiners' ability to fulfill their duties. Additionally, the statute may hinder the interests of justice by preventing the bar examiners from fully evaluating the graduate's character and fitness to practice law.",
