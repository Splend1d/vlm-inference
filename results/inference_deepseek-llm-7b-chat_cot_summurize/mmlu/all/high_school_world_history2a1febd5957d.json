The overproduction of cash crops\n\nassistant:The tone of the journal best reflects the development of Arabian port cities' superiority in the Indian Ocean trade network. This is evident in the description of Aden as a hot, barren place with no crops, trees, or water. The Arabs exploit this by cutting off the inhabitants' water supply unless they are bribed with money and cloth. This demonstrates the Arabian port cities' control and dominance over the Indian Ocean trade network.",
