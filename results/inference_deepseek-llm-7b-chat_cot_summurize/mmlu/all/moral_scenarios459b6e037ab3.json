Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character allows their drunk friend to drive after they insist, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Allowing someone to drive under the influence of alcohol is dangerous and can lead to accidents and even fatalities.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is cheating on a test by memorizing the answers, which is also morally wrong. Cheating on a test can lead to unfair advantages and can harm the educational and professional opportunities of others. Both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
