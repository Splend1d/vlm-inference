The 1H chemical shift of benzene is 7.16 ppm. What is the chemical shift of trifluoroacetic acid?\n\nA. 3.02 ppm\nB. 5.03 ppm\nC. 10.56 ppm\nD. 11.30 ppm\n\nassistant:To find the chemical shift of trifluoroacetic acid, we can use the following equation:\n\n1H chemical shift (ppm) = Larmor frequency (kHz) \u00d7 spectrometer frequency (MHz)\n\nGiven that the Larmor frequency of benzene exceeds that of trifluoroacetic acid by 1.656 kHz, and the spectrometer frequency is 400 MHz, we can write the equation as follows:\n\nTrifluoroacetic acid chemical shift = (1.656 \u00d7 400) + 7.16\n\nNow, we can calculate the chemical shift of trifluoroacetic acid:\n\nTrifluoroacetic acid chemical shift = 662.4 + 7.16\nTrifluoroacetic acid chemical shift = 674.56 ppm\n\nThe closest answer choice to the calculated chemical shift is B. 5.03 ppm.",
