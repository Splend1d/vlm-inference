What is the molarity of this solution?\n\nA. 0.496 molar\nB. 0.656 mol/L\nC. 3.3 molar\nD. 6.3 \u00d7 10^-3 molar\n\nassistant:To find the molarity of the solution, we need to determine the number of moles of Ni(NO3)2 in the solution. We can do this by dividing the mass of Ni(NO3)2 by its molar mass.\n\nFirst, let's find the molar mass of Ni(NO3)2. The molar mass of Ni is 59.5 g/mol, and the molar mass of NO3^- is 96 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of Ni(NO3)2 is:\n\nmolar_mass = (molar_mass_Ni) + (molar_mass_NO3^-)\nmolar_mass = (59.5 g/mol) + (96 g/mol)\nmolar_mass = 155.5 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of Ni(NO3)2 in the solution:\n\nmoles_Ni = (mass_Ni(NO3)2) / (molar_mass_Ni(NO3)2)\nmoles_Ni = (30.0 g) / (155.5 g/mol)\nmoles_Ni = 0.191 mol\n\nFinally, we can find the molarity of the solution:\n\nmolarity = (moles_Ni) / (volume_solution)\nmolarity = (0.191 mol) / (0.025 L)\nmolarity = 0.764 mol/L\n\nThe closest answer to this is option B. 0.656 mol/L.",
