This implies that the concept of superiority and inferiority are subjective and can vary depending on different perspectives. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it contradicts Carens' argument. Option B is also incorrect because it does not address the concept of superiority and inferiority, but rather focuses on the reasons for exclusion. Option D is incorrect because it is not directly related to the argument made by Carens.",
