This is because the state statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years, and since the mistake in the estate plan was discovered in 2004, Gordon's lawsuit in 2005 is outside the statute of limitations. The other options are not relevant to the statute of limitations or the rule against perpetuities, and option C is not a valid defense in this case.",
