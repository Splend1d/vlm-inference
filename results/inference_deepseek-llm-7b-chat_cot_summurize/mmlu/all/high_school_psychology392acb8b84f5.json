This means that you should conduct the same experiment multiple times with different participants or groups to ensure that the results are consistent and not due to chance. This also helps to increase the reliability and validity of the findings. Running an experiment and finding statistically significant results are also important steps, but replicating the findings is the final step in proving a psychological theory.",
