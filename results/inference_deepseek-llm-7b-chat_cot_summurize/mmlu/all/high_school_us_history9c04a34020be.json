Wheatley's poem also highlights the idea of redemption and the transformative power of mercy and understanding, which is another similarity to Edwards's sermon. The Declaration of Independence, Seneca Falls Declaration of Rights and Sentiments, and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech do not share the same themes as Wheatley's poem.",
