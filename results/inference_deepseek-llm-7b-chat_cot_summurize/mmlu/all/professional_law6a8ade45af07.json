At the time of the father's death, he believed that he owned all of the 100-acre tract. However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter \u0080\u0094buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract.

In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will\n\nA. lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.\nB. lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\nC. win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.\nD. win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n\nAccording to the facts given, the daughter executed a warranty deed to the buyer, conveying all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter-buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. The farmer then quitclaimed her interest in the five-acre parcel to the buyer as part of their agreement.\n\nThe doctrine of after-acquired title states that if a person acquires title to property after the execution of a deed conveying the property, that person can claim title to the entire property, including the newly acquired portion. In this case, the buyer acquired the five-acre tract from the farmer after the warranty deed from the daughter was executed, making her the true record owner of the five-acre parcel.\n\nTherefore, the buyer will win the action to determine the title to the five-acre tract, as the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.",
