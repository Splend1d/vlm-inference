A constructive eviction occurs when the landlord's failure to maintain the property or allow it to be used for its intended purpose creates an uninhabitable living environment, forcing the tenant to move or suffer significant inconvenience. In this case, the professor's failure to address the infestation of rats and the resulting unsanitary conditions may have forced the tenant to move out, leading to a constructive eviction.",
