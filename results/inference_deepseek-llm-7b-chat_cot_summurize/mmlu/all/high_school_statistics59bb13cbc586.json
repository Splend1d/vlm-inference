Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion concerning the two classes' performance on the test?\n\nA. Mr. Bee's class is less heterogeneous than Mr. Em's.\nB. Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr. Bee's.\nC. Mr. Bee's class performed twice as well as Mr. Em's.\nD. Mr. Em's class did not do as well as Mr. Bee's.\n\nassistant:The standard deviation of a set of data represents the amount of variation or dispersion in the data. A lower standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, while a higher standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out.\n\nIn this case, Mr. Bee's class had a standard deviation of 11.2, while Mr. Em's class had a standard deviation of 5.6. This suggests that Mr. Bee's class had a higher level of variation or dispersion in their test scores compared to Mr. Em's class. Therefore, Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr. Bee's class.\n\nSo, the most reasonable conclusion is:\n\nB. Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr. Bee's.",
