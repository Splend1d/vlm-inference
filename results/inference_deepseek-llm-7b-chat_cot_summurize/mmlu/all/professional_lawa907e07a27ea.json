This argument would be valid because the judge made the decision solely on the documentary evidence, which means that there was no opportunity for a trial or for the judge to hear testimony from witnesses or evaluate the credibility of the evidence. This could lead to an incorrect decision being made. The other options do not provide a strong enough argument to reverse the judgment.",
