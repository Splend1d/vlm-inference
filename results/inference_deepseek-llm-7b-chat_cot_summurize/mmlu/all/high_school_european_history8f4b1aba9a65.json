The passage describes the thoughts of a character named Souvarine, who is in despair over the news he has received in Russia. He talks about his old dream of fraternity and his attempts to establish a new society of labor in common. He criticizes the French workmen for not having the courage to give back the money they have won in the lottery to the poor and for their selfish desire to become bourgeois themselves.\n\nThe nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would probably be most interested in the sense of continual class struggle, as it is a central theme in the passage. Souvarine criticizes the French workmen for their lack of courage and their selfish desire to become bourgeois themselves, highlighting the class struggle between the rich and the poor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. the sense of continual class struggle.",
