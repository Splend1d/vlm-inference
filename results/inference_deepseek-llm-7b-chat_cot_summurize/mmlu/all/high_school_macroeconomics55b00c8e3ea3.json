Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; sell bonds.\nB. Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\nC. Raise reserve requirements; raise the discount rate; sell bonds.\nD. Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) uses various tools to control the money supply, including reserve requirements, discount rates, and open market operations.\n\n1. Raise reserve requirements: This action requires banks to hold more reserves, which can reduce the amount of money they lend to customers. Therefore, it might not increase the money supply directly.\n\n2. Lower the discount rate: This action makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Fed, which can encourage banks to lend more to customers. This can increase the money supply.\n\n3. Sell bonds: The Fed can sell bonds to reduce the amount of money available in the economy, which can decrease the money supply.\n\n4. Raise reserve requirements: This action is similar to option A and may also reduce the amount of money banks can lend.\n\n5. Lower the discount rate: This action is similar to option B and can increase the money supply.\n\n6. Buy bonds: The Fed can buy bonds to increase the amount of money available in the economy, which can increase the money supply.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B contains only Fed actions that will increase the money supply. Therefore, the answer is B. Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.",
