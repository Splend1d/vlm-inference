Environmental\nB. Ecological\nC. Fitness\nD. Congruence\n\nassistant:The theory being referred to in the question is the Environmental Theory of Aging, which posits that the ability to complete a task depends on the fit between the environment and the person undertaking the task. This theory suggests that as people age, they may experience changes in their environment that make it more difficult for them to complete tasks, leading to a decline in their ability to do so. This theory is closely related to the concept of \"congruence,\" which refers to the degree to which the person and the environment are compatible. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Congruence.",
