Yes, because in most circumstances an \"unclaimed\" notification is insufficient to satisfy the demands of due process.\n\nIn this case, the owner had not claimed the certified mail sent to him, and the city decided that the notice was sufficient to sell the property. The owner argues that this was insufficient notice, and the court may agree if they determine that an \"unclaimed\" notification is not sufficient to satisfy due process demands. The other answers are incorrect because they either do not address the issue of insufficient notice or are based on the owner's knowledge of the tax situation or the city's expectation of property management.",
