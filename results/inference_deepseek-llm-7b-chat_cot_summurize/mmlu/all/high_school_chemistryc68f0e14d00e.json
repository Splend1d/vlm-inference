O\u2014S\nIn this option, the oxygen atom is bonded to the sulfur atom first, and then the sulfur atom is bonded to the carbon atom. This is not the correct order.\n\nB. Br\u2014N\nIn this option, the bromine atom is bonded to the nitrogen atom first, and then the nitrogen atom is bonded to the carbon atom. This is also not the correct order.\n\nC. N\u2014C\nIn this option, the nitrogen atom is bonded to the carbon atom first, and then the carbon atom is bonded to the sulfur atom. This is the correct order.\n\nD. P\u2014Cl\nIn this option, the phosphorus atom is bonded to the chlorine atom first, and then the chlorine atom is bonded to the carbon atom. This is not the correct order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. N\u2014C.",
