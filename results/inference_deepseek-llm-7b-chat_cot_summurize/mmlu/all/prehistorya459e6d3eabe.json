Homo erectus\nB. premodern Homo sapiens\nC. Neandertals\nD. modern Homo sapiens\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first need to retrieve information on the brain-to-body size ratio for each of the given species.\n\n1. Homo erectus:\nBrain size: 950-1,100 cc\nBody size: ~150 kg\nBrain-to-body size ratio: 6.33%\n\n2. premodern Homo sapiens:\n(Note: The term \"premodern Homo sapiens\" is not well-defined and may refer to different species or time periods in human evolution. For the purpose of this answer, I will assume it refers to the early Homo sapiens species. Please provide more specific information if possible.)\n\nBrain size: 1,100-1,300 cc\nBody size: ~60-70 kg\nBrain-to-body size ratio: 17.67%\n\n3. Neandertals:\nBrain size: 1,150-1,350 cc\nBody size: ~50-70 kg\nBrain-to-body size ratio: 22.50%\n\n4. modern Homo sapiens:\nBrain size: 1,250-1,400 cc\nBody size: ~50-75 kg\nBrain-to-body size ratio: 15.00-18.00%\n\nBased on these ratios, premodern Homo sapiens has a proportionally larger brain than the other species.",
