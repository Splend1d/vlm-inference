In Darwin's thinking, the more closely related two different organisms are, the more recently they shared a common ancestor. This is because relatedness is determined by their genetic similarity.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. More closely related organisms would have more similar habitats, not necessarily the same habitats. This option is not correct.\n\nB. Less closely related organisms would have more similar DNA sequences. This option is also not correct. DNA sequences become more similar as relatedness increases.\n\nC. The correct answer: More closely related organisms would have more recently shared a common ancestor. This is in line with Darwin's thinking and the concept of relatedness.\n\nD. The less closely related organisms are, the less likely they are to have the same genes in common. This option is not correct. Relatedness is determined by genetic similarity, not by the likelihood of sharing genes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. More closely related organisms would have more recently shared a common ancestor.",
