Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character simply placed their mobile phone in a new case. This action does not involve any morally wrongdoing.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character mows their parents' yard while they are fast asleep. This action may be seen as morally wrong by some people, as it is considered disrespectful to someone's privacy and personal space. However, it is not a clear violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
