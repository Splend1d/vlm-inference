M \u2228 N is true when either M is true or N is true.\n2. (~M \u00b7 O) / N is true when the left side (~M \u00b7 O) is false and the right side N is true.\n\nThe argument states that ~M \u00b7 O / N is true if either M is false and O is true or N is true. However, the truth table shows that (~M \u00b7 O / N) is true when either M is true and O and N are false, or O is true and M and N are false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nThe answer is B.",
