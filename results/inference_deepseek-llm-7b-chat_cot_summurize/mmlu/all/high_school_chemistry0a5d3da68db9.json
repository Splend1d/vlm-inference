C2H2(g) + 5N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + 5N2(g). This is because it involves the mixing of solid, liquid, and gas phases in the reaction, making it heterogeneous.\n\nThe other options are homogeneous reactions, as they do not involve the mixing of solid, liquid, and gas phases.\n\nA. 2C2H2(g) + 5O2(g) \u2192 4CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) - Homogeneous\nB.
