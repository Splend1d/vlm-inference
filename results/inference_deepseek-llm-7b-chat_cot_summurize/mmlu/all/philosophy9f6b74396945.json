Psychological egoism is the view that all of our actions are motivated by self-interest. While it is possible that we might feel pleasure when we get what we want because it is a self-interested action, there could be other reasons for feeling pleasure as well. For example, we might feel pleasure when we get what we want because it is a reward for a desired behavior, or because it brings us closer to our goals. Therefore, the claim that we always feel pleasure when we get what we want does not necessarily support psychological egoism.",
