It does not anticipate much association between cholesterol level and gender, but it does anticipate an association between cholesterol level and the amount of exercise a person gets. For a randomized block design, it should:\n\nA. Block on gender because it is not associated with cholesterol level.\nB. Block on gender because males and females are different.\nC. Block on the type of drug because it may be associated with cholesterol level.\nD. Block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level.\n\nassistant:To determine the appropriate block design for the randomized trial, we need to consider the factors that are associated with cholesterol levels and the types of individuals included in the study.\n\nSince the study anticipates an association between cholesterol level and the amount of exercise a person gets, it would be appropriate to block on exercise level. Blocking on exercise level would help to ensure that participants with different exercise levels are not combined, which could affect the validity of the study results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level.",
