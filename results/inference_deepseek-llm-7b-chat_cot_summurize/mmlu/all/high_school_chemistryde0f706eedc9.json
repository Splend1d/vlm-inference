Cr\nB. Mn\nC. Si\nD. S\n\nassistant:A metalloid is a chemical element that has properties of both metals and nonmetals. Among the options you provided, only silicon (Si) is considered a metalloid. Silicon is a semi-metal, meaning it has some properties of metals, such as conducting electricity and being good at forming ionic bonds, but also some properties of nonmetals, such as covalent bonding and the ability to form covalent compounds. The other options are all metals: chromium (Cr) is a good conductor of electricity and a hard, shiny element, manganese (Mn) is a hard, brittle metal that is used in alloys and oxidizes easily, and sulfur (S) is a nonmetal that is a component of many minerals and is used in making sulfuric acid and other chemicals.",
