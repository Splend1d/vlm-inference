LiOH(aq)\nB. CBr4(aq)\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq)\nD. AlCl3(aq)\n\nassistant:To determine which solution is most soluble for the solid MgCl2, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. LiOH(aq) - Lithium hydroxide is a strong base, and it would react with MgCl2 to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride. The solubility of MgCl2 in LiOH would depend on the concentration of LiOH and the temperature.\n\nB. CBr4(aq) - Carbon tetrachloride is a nonpolar solvent, and it would not interact with MgCl2. However, it is not a common or practical solvent to compare solubility with.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq) - Magnesium nitrate is a weak electrolyte. It would dissolve in water but not in its pure form. The solubility of MgCl2 in Mg(NO3)2 would depend on the pH and temperature.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq) - Aluminum chloride is a strong electrolyte. It would dissolve in water but not in its pure form. The solubility of MgCl2 in AlCl3 would depend on the pH and temperature.\n\nConsidering the given options, it is not possible to definitively determine which solution is most soluble for the solid MgCl2. However, we can make a general comparison. Among the options, AlCl3 and Mg(NO3)2 are both weak electrolytes, while LiOH is a strong base. Since strong electrolytes dissolve more readily in water, it is likely that MgCl2 would dissolve more easily in AlCl3 or Mg(NO3)2 than in LiOH. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that a sample of solid MgCl2 would be most soluble in either AlCl3 or Mg(NO3)2.",
