It is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the United States.\n\nGDP is typically measured on a quarterly basis, which means that it is calculated for each quarter (three-month period) of the year. For example, the GDP for Q1 (January to March) would be calculated and released in April, the GDP for Q2 (April to June) would be calculated and released in July, and so on.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Bureau of Economic Analysis does not calculate GDP on a weekly basis. Option C is also incorrect because while the Bureau of Economic Analysis does calculate GDP on a quarterly basis, they do not calculate it on a monthly basis. Option D is incorrect because the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is responsible for measuring various labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate and inflation, but they do not calculate GDP.",
