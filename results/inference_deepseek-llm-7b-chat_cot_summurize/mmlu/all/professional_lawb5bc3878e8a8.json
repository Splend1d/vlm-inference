This is because, as stated in the text, \"In March 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed.\" This means that the man has priority over the woman in terms of ownership of the property, and therefore, he will be able to win the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. win, because his deed antedated the woman's deed.",
