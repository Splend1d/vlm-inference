The Durbin-Watson test is a common test for detecting autocorrelation in a time series, and can be used up to third order.\n\nB. White's test is another test for detecting autocorrelation in a time series, and is also applicable up to third order.\n\nC. The RESET test is a test for detecting both serial correlation and outliers in a time series, and is also applicable up to third order.\n\nD. The Breusch-Godfrey test is a test for detecting autocorrelation in a time series, and is also applicable up to third order.\n\nAll of these tests are commonly used to assess the presence of autocorrelation in a time series.",
