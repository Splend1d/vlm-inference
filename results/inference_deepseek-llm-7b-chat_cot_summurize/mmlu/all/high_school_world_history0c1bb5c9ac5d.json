This information directly supports the conclusion that the empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. The passage does not support the other options: long-distance contact between civilizations did not stagnate, new religious traditions did not overthrow prior lasting religious beliefs, and technological developments did not spread across trade routes. The presence of Muslims in Hangzhou is evidence of the connections and trade between different empires and regions during this period.",
