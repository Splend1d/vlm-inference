He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?\n\nA. Intramural (pre-prostatic)\nB. Membranous\nC. Prostatic\nD. Spongy\n\nassistant:The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the urethral meatus is at greatest risk for injury. The urethral meatus is the opening of the urethra, which is located at the tip of the penis. The patient reported blood at the urethral meatus, which could indicate trauma to this area. Additionally, the plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus, which is a part of the pelvis, and the retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. All of these findings suggest that the urethral meatus is at greatest risk for injury. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Intramural (pre-prostatic).",
