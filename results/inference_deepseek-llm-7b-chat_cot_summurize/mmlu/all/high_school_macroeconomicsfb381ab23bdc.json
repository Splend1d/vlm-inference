(B) (C) and (D).\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B.\n\nNational income measures the total income earned by the factors of production in a country. It includes wages and salaries, profits, rent, interest, and owner's income. It does not include household income, as it only measures the income earned by the factors of production.\n\nOption A is incorrect because household income is a part of personal income, which is a component of national income but not the same thing.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is a calculation used to derive national income, not a measure of national income itself. It is GDP minus depreciation and indirect business taxes, which are subtracted from GDP to get national income.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is a combination of two measures of national income (B and C), and does not provide a new measure of national income.",
