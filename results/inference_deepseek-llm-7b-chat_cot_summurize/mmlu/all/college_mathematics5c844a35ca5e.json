If the operator D sends p(x) in P to its derivative p\u2032(x), what are the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D?\n\nA. n = 1 and r = 6\nB. n = 1 and r = 7\nC. n = 2 and r = 5\nD. n = 2 and r = 6\n\nassistant:To find the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D, we need to determine the number of linearly independent polynomials in P that are mapped to 0 by D.\n\nLet's consider a polynomial p(x) in P. Since p(x) has degree less than or equal to 7, it can be represented as:\n\np(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4x^4 + a_5x^5 + a_6x^6 + a_7x^7\n\nNow, let's compute the derivative p'(x) of p(x):\n\np'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + 3a_3x^2 + 4a_4x^3 + 5a_5x^4 + 6a_6x^5 + 7a_7x^6\n\nNow, let's consider the set of polynomials {p(x), p(x) + p'(x), p(x) + p'(x) + p''(x), ..., p(x) + p''(x) + p'''(x)}.\n\nSince p(x), p'(x), p''(x), ..., are all polynomials with coefficients in Z_5, their sum will also be a polynomial with coefficients in Z_5. Moreover, the derivative of a polynomial with degree less than or equal to 7 is also a polynomial with degree less than or equal to 7.\n\nNow, let's check if any of these polynomials are mapped to 0 by D. If p(x) is mapped to 0 by D, then p'(x) + p''(x) + ... + p^n(x) will also be mapped to 0 by D. Since the sum of these polynomials is a polynomial with coefficients in Z_5, each term in the sum must be mapped to 0 by D.\n\nIf p(x) is mapped to 0 by D, then a_1 + 2a_2x + 3a_3x^2 + 4a_4x^3 + 5a_5x^4 + 6a_6x^5 + 7a_7x^6 = 0.\n\nWe can see that the coefficients of these polynomials are linear combinations of the coefficients of p(x). Therefore, the null space of D is one-dimensional.\n\nNow let's consider the range of D. Since the derivative of a polynomial with degree less than or equal to 7 is also a polynomial with degree less than or equal to 7, the range of D consists of all polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 7.\n\nThe number of linearly independent polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 7 is 6 (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5). Therefore, the dimension of the range of D is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: n = 1 and r = 7.",
