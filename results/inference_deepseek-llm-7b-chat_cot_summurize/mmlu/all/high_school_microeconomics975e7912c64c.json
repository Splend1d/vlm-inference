This competition can cause the demand for existing firms to shift rightward, which means that the market share of the existing firms decreases and the market share of the new firms increases. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. The market price of the product does not increase in a monopolistically competitive market. Prices are set by the competitive firms, and there is no single firm with market power to raise the price.\n\nC. The demand for existing firms does not become more inelastic. In a monopolistically competitive market, the demand is typically elastic because there are many substitutes available to consumers.\n\nD. The demand for existing firms does not shift leftward. As mentioned earlier, the demand for existing firms shifts rightward as new firms enter the market and compete with them.",
