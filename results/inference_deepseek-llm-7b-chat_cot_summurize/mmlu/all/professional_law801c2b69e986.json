Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\n\nIn this scenario, Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar for his hardware store. The loan was unsecured, and Ted's only interest in the business was the repayment of his loan. Since there was no partnership agreement between Bob and Ted, Pete Smith assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and selling goods to them. However, the true situation is that only Bob Wilson was operating the business and was liable for the debt.\n\nTherefore, Pete Smith should only pursue Bob Wilson for the unpaid goods. Since Ted Lamar was not a partner or co-owner of the business, he is not liable for the debt. However, if Pete Smith is unable to collect the debt from Bob Wilson, Ted Lamar may be liable to the extent that his unsecured loan was not repaid.",
