If the Earth were to be moved to an orbit three times further away from the Sun, the length of a year would increase. This is because the time it takes for an object to orbit the Sun is directly proportional to the square of the object's orbital radius. Since the radius would be three times larger, the time it takes for a full orbit would be approximately 5.2 times longer.",
