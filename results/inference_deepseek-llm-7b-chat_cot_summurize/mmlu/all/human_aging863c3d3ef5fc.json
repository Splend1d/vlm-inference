They have fewer novel experiences.\n\nThis is a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of time seeming to pass more quickly for older adults. As people age, they often have fewer novel experiences, such as starting new jobs, traveling to new places, or meeting new people. These novel experiences can help create a sense of novelty and interest in the world, which can make time seem to pass more slowly. In contrast, older adults may have fewer of these novel experiences, which can lead to a sense of time moving more quickly.",
