The labor supply curve shifts to the right\n\nWhen the market demand curve for labor shifts to the right, it means that there is a decrease in the price of labor (wage). This leads to a decrease in the marginal benefit of labor. As a result, the labor supply curve shifts to the right, which means that more workers are willing to supply their labor to firms at a lower wage. This increased supply of labor will help firms meet the increased demand for labor, and the market equilibrium will be achieved.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they do not have a direct impact on the labor supply curve. Increasing the number of firms does not necessarily affect the labor supply curve, and shifting the labor supply curve to the left would imply a decrease in the supply of labor, which contradicts the fact that the labor demand curve shifts to the right.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it does not have a direct impact on the labor supply curve. A decrease in the price of output does not necessarily affect the labor supply curve.",
