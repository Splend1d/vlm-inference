Ross discusses three prima facie duties: the duty to keep promises, the duty not to harm others, and the duty to protect the natural environment. The duty of nonmaleficence is a specific duty that arises from the general duty not to harm others, and it is not a separate prima facie duty that Ross discusses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. the duty of nonmaleficence.",
