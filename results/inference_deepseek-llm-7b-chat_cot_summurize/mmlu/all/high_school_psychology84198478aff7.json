This performing phenomenon is known by which of the following names?\n\nA. The self-fulfilling prophecy\nB. The law of effect\nC. The primacy effect\nD. Social loafing\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe self-fulfilling prophecy is a concept that refers to the process by which the expectations or beliefs of individuals can cause those expectations to become a self-fulfilling reality. In this case, labeling students as disabled may lead to a performance that is consistent with the characteristics associated with the label, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nOption B, the law of effect, is not relevant to this situation. The law of effect is a principle in psychology that states that behaviors that are followed by positive outcomes are more likely to be repeated, while behaviors that are followed by negative outcomes are less likely to be repeated.\n\nOption C, the primacy effect, is also not relevant. The primacy effect refers to the tendency for the first thing in a sequence to be remembered more easily than later items.\n\nOption D, social loafing, is not applicable in this context. Social loafing is a phenomenon in which group members do less work than they would if working alone, due to the feeling of being \"let off the hook\" by the group.",
