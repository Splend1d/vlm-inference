Each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to the vertex. If the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001$, then what is the sum of the numbers written on the faces?\n\nA. 18\nB. 13\nC. 1001\nD. 31\n\nassistant:Let the six numbers on the faces of the cube be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ $e,$ and $f$. We are given that the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to 1001: \\[\n\\begin{aligned} a \\cdot b \\cdot c &= 1, \\\\ b \\cdot c \\cdot d &= 1, \\\\ c \\cdot d \\cdot e &= 1, \\\\ d \\cdot e \\cdot f &= 1, \\\\ e \\cdot f \\cdot a &= 1, \\\\ f \\cdot a \\cdot b &= 1. \\end{aligned}\n\\] We can write these equations in matrix form as \\[\n\\begin{aligned} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ b & c & d \\\\ c & d & e \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ e & f & a \\\\ f & a & b \\end{pmatrix} &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{aligned}\n\\] The sum of the numbers on the faces is equal to the sum of the entries of this matrix, which is \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ b & c & d \\\\ c & d & e \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ e & f & a \\\\ f & a & b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a+b \\\\ b+c \\\\ c+d \\\\ d+e \\\\ e+f \\\\ f+a \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] Since the sum of the numbers on the vertices is 1001, we must have \\[\na+b+c+d+e+f = 1001.\n\\] Therefore, the sum of the numbers on the faces is \\[\na+b+c+d+e+f = \\boxed{\\text{(C) 1001}}.\n\\]\nThe answer is: 1001",
