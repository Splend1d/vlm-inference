The relation is given by the following formula: Selling price = 15.9 \u2013 0.983 (age) Which of the following can we conclude from this equation?\n\nA. For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.\nB. A new car costs on the average $9,830.\nC. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.\nD. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given information and evaluate each option:\n\nA. For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.\nThe given formula is: Selling price = 15.9 - 0.983(age)\n\nTo find out how much the selling price decreases for every year the car gets older, we can plug in the age (in years) and calculate the percentage decrease. For example, if the age of the car is 1 year, the selling price would decrease by 0.983(1) = $0.983. The percentage decrease would be: (0.983 / 15.9) x 100 = 6.208%.\n\nSo, this option is partially correct. The selling price does decrease by approximately 6.208% for every year the car gets older.\n\nB. A new car costs on the average $9,830.\nThis option cannot be concluded from the given information. The given formula only describes the relation between the selling price and age, but it does not provide any information about the cost of a new car.\n\nC. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.\nThis option cannot be concluded from the given information. The given formula only describes the relation between the selling price and age, but it does not provide any information about the exact amount of the price drop for each year.\n\nD. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\nThis option cannot be concluded from the given information. The given formula only describes the relation between the selling price and age, but it does not provide any information about the exact amount of the price drop for each year.\n\nBased on the analysis, the closest option to the truth is option A. However, none of the given options are completely accurate or representative of the relation between the selling price and age of the car.",
