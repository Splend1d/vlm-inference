It gives rise to several structures in the developing embryo, such as the neural tube, skin, and parts of the nervous system.\n\nStep 2: Compare the structures with the given options.\nA. Neural tube: The neural tube is indeed derived from the ectoderm, making option A the correct answer.\nB. Ectomesenchymal cells: These are a type of cell that can be found in various tissues, such as the neural tube, but they are not directly derived from the ectoderm.\nC. Dental enamel: Dental enamel is derived from the dental papilla, which is a tissue-like structure that is part of the ectoderm.\nD. All three structures: While the neural tube and dental enamel are indeed derived from the ectoderm, ectomesenchymal cells are not directly derived from the ectoderm.\n\nStep 3: Select the best answer based on the comparison.\nThe best answer is option A, as the neural tube is the structure that is directly derived from the ectoderm.",
