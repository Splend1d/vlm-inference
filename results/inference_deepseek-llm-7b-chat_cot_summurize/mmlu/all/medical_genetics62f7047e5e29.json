Autosomal dominant\nB. Autosomal recessive\nC. X-linked dominant\nD. X-linked recessive\n\nassistant:Autozygosity mapping is a technique used to map genetic disorders that show an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. This means that only one copy of a mutated gene is required for the development of the disorder, as opposed to autosomal recessive inheritance, where two copies of a mutated gene are needed. Autozygosity mapping involves the use of genetic markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to track the inheritance of a particular trait or disorder within a family. By comparing the genotypes of family members, researchers can identify the location and allele responsible for the disorder.",
