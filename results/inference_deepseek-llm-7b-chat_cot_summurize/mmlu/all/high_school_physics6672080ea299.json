In the experiment, temperature (in K) is the independent variable and volume (in m^3) is the dependent variable. If a plot is produced where the dependent variable is on the vertical axis, which of the following is true about the slope and y-intercept of the graph?\n\nA. The slope will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3.\nB. The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3.\nC. The slope will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will not be 0 m^3.\nD. The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will not be 0 m^3.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3.\n\nThe equation for an ideal gas is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is amount of substance, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. The equation can be rewritten as V/P = nRT/P = nRT, which simplifies to V = nRT/P.\n\nIf we rearrange the equation, we get V = kP/T, where k is a constant. This equation shows that the slope of the graph is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the y-intercept is 0 m^3.\n\nIn option A, the equation should be V = kP/T, not kP. In option C, the y-intercept is incorrect. In option D, the y-intercept is incorrect.",
