Rover was a good, friendly dog who loved to run and chase cars but had never hurt anyone.

Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\n\nIn this scenario, Doug Dogman's domesticated golden retriever named Rover was chasing cars in the street, causing Ginny Grandmother to swerve and hit a parked car, resulting in a head injury. Under a strict liability theory, the court would likely find that Doug is responsible for Ginny's injuries because his dog was a cause in fact of her injuries.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because a domesticated dog is not an excuse for its owner's liability. Answer C is also incorrect because a statute or ordinance banning unleashed dogs on public streets would not apply to this situation. Answer D is incorrect because the strict liability rule for dogs would include dogs not displaying vicious propensities, but in this case, it is clear that Rover did not display vicious propensities.",
