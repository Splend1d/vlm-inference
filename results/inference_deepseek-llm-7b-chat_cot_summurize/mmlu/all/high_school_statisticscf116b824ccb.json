Her grade will go up by 40.05 points.\nB. Her grade will go up by 20.4 points.\nC. Her grade will remain unchanged.\nD. Her grade will down by 10.2 points.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to perform a linear regression. First, let's represent the given data:\n\nGrade (y) = 50.25 + 10.2x (h)\n\nNow, we will calculate the slope (b1) and the y-intercept (b0) of the linear regression.\n\nb1 = 10.2\nb0 = 50.25\n\nNext, we will use the formula to predict the grade for a student who studies for two hours:\n\nGrade (h = 2) = b0 + b1 * 2\nGrade = 50.25 + (10.2 * 2)\n\nGrade = 50.25 + 20.4\nGrade = 70.65\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference in grade if the student studies for two hours:\n\nChange in Grade = 70.65 - 50.25\nChange in Grade = 20.4\n\nBased on the linear regression, if the student studies for two hours, her grade will go up by 20.4 points. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Her grade will go up by 20.4 points.",
