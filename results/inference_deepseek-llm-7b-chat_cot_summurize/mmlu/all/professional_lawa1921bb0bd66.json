However, Thornton is not authorized to execute contracts on behalf of the partnership. Therefore, the contract that Thornton enters into with Clark is unenforceable because it was executed by an unauthorized partner.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The partner agreement does not have the power to withhold statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. Clark not knowing about the internal agreement between Kendall and Thornton does not make the contract enforceable. It is still unenforceable because Thornton is not authorized to execute the contract on behalf of the partnership.\n\nD. Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority before entering into a service contract with the partnership. However, since Thornton is not authorized to execute contracts on behalf of the partnership, this option is incorrect as well.",
