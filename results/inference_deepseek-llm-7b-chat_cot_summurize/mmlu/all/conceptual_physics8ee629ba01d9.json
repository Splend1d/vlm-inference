Light that is not transmitted by opaque materials is reflected or converted to internal energy in the material. Opaque materials, such as bricks or rocks, do not allow light to pass through them. Instead, they either reflect the light (option B) or absorb it and convert it to internal energy (option A). Option C, refracted, refers to how light bends when passing from one medium to another, and option D is not relevant to opaque materials.",
