This was the only piece of real estate that the investor owned. The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A tenancy at will was created.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\nD. The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n\nassistant:The legal relationship between the parties is best described as a periodic tenancy from year-to-year. This is because the leasehold agreement states that the landlord is leasing the first floor of the building to the tenant for three years. While the rental payments are made monthly, the duration of the lease is still from year-to-year.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. A tenancy at will does not specify a duration for the tenancy, and the leasehold agreement provided specifically mentions a three-year lease.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month would mean that the lease would renew automatically each month, which is not the case here.\nC. The tenant's equitable three-year term becoming a legal three-year term is not a valid legal relationship, as a leasehold agreement with a specified duration of three years is in place.",
