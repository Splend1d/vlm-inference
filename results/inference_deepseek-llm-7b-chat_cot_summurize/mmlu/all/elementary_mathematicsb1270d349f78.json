How many calories are in 6 ounces of that ice cream?\n\nA. 232\nB. 236\nC. 345\nD. 460\n\nassistant:To determine the number of calories in 6 ounces of the ice cream, we can use the given information about 4 ounces. Since there are 400 calories in 16 ounces (4 ounces x 4), we can find the number of calories in 6 ounces by multiplying the number of calories in 4 ounces by 1.5 (since 6 is 1.5 times 4).\n\n230 calories (in 4 ounces) x 1.5 = 345 calories (in 6 ounces)\n\nThe answer is C. 345 calories.",
