The zoning ordinance provision would be upheld as constitutional under the state's police power.\n\nassistant:B. The zoning ordinance would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance provision that prohibits unrelated, unmarried persons from residing in a single family residence is that it would be declared unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is because the ordinance discriminates against unmarried individuals, who are being denied the right to live in a single-family residence based on their marital status. The ordinance does not apply equally to all persons, as it only applies to unmarried individuals and not to married individuals.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from being deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. However, the ordinance is not depriving the resident of any of these rights, but rather is regulating the use of property. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n\nC. The contract clause of the Constitution protects against the impairment of contractual obligations. However, the ordinance does not impair any contractual obligations; it merely regulates the use of property. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n\nD. While the state's police power allows the government to enact laws to protect public health, safety, and welfare, it does not necessarily mean that such laws are constitutional. The ordinance in question discriminates against a specific group of individuals based on their marital status, which is not a valid exercise of the police power. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",
