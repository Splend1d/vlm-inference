A major shift of urban voters in Northern states from the Republican to the Democratic Party.\n\nThe New Deal was a series of programs and policies enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The New Deal was successful because it was able to gain the support of urban voters in the Northern states, who were traditionally Republican but shifted to the Democratic Party during the New Deal era. The New Deal's focus on social welfare programs and the Works Progress Administration, which provided jobs for the unemployed, were particularly popular among urban voters. Additionally, Roosevelt's charismatic leadership and his ability to communicate with the American people through his \"fireside chats\" helped to solidify the New Deal coalition.",
