Let $x = 0.\\overline{1}$. Then we have:\n\n$x = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10^2} + \\frac{1}{10^3} + \\dotsb$\n\nThis is a geometric series with a common ratio of $1/10$. The sum of an infinite geometric series with a nonzero first term and a common ratio less than 1 is:\n\n$S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}$\n\nwhere $S$ is the sum of the series, $a$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio. In this case, $a = \\frac{1}{10}$ and $r = 1/10$. So the sum of the series is:\n\n$S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{1 - \\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{9}{10}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot \\frac{10}{9} = \\frac{1}{9}$\n\nTherefore, $x = \\frac{1}{9}$. To express $0.\\overline{7}$ as a fraction, we can write it as the sum of two fractions:\n\n$0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10^2} + \\frac{1}{10^3} + \\dotsb$\n\nNow we can compare this with the expression for $x$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10^2} + \\frac{1}{10^3} + \\dotsb = \\frac{1}{9}$\n\nSubtracting the two expressions, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10^2} + \\frac{1}{10^3} + \\dotsb - \\frac{1}{9} = 0$\n\nSince the left side is an infinite geometric series with a nonzero first term and a common ratio less than 1, the sum of the series is:\n\n$\\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{1 - \\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{8}{9}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot \\frac{9}{8} = \\frac{9}{80}$\n\nTherefore, $0.\\overline{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{80}}$.\nThe answer is: \\frac{9}{80}",
