This can lead to conflicts and delays in the confirmation of those nominated to be ambassadors, as well as other appointments and legislation.\n\nFor example, if the president nominates someone for a position in the federal government, the nomination must be approved by the Senate. If the Senate is controlled by the other party, they may delay or block the nomination, leading to conflict and gridlock. This can also happen with legislation, where one party may pass a bill in the House, but the other party controls the Senate, leading to delays or a lack of support for the bill.\n\nIn addition, divided government can also lead to changes in the composition of the Supreme Court, as the president may nominate judges who are not confirmed by the Senate. This can lead to conflicts and delays in the confirmation process.\n\nOverall, divided government can lead to a variety of conflicts and delays, including in the confirmation of those nominated to be ambassadors.",
