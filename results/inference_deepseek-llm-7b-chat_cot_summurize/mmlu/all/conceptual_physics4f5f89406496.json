In the case of beats, interference between two or more waves with the same frequency but different amplitudes leads to the phenomenon of beats.\n\nA. Destruction is not the result of beats, as it involves the breaking or damaging of objects.\n\nC. Resonance is the phenomenon of a system vibrating at a particular frequency due to its natural frequency, and it is not directly related to beats.\n\nD. Amplification is the process of increasing the amplitude of a signal, and it is not the result of beats.",
