After the second game of the season, the plaintiff was suddenly dismissed as the coach for undisclosed reasons. After the dismissal was made public, the local newspaper ran an article discussing the plaintiff's tenure as coach. The article, which was written by the sports editor, stated that \"The plaintiff was a bad role model and morally unfit for the coaching job. \"The plaintiff brought suit against the newspaper for defamation. At trial, the plaintiff called a player on the basketball team to testify that \"the plaintiff was a good role model and respected by the players. \" In presenting its evidence, the newspaper called a witness to testify. He proposes to testify that he saw the plaintiff give beer to players on three occasions after victories. Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, witness's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, for impeachment purposes only.\nB. admissible, as substantive evidence.\nC. inadmissible, because specific instances of conduct is an improper method of proving character.\nD. inadmissible to prove character, but admissible for the purpose of showing intent or common scheme.\n\nassistant:The witness's testimony is inadmissible for two reasons. First, it is an improper method of proving character. The witness is trying to prove the plaintiff's character by specifically mentioning three instances of the plaintiff giving beer to players, which is not an appropriate way to establish someone's character. Courts generally require evidence that is more general and relevant to the plaintiff's overall character. Second, this evidence is not relevant to the issue at hand. The issue in the case is whether the plaintiff is a bad role model and morally unfit for the coaching job, and the witness's testimony about the plaintiff giving beer to players does not address this issue. The testimony is therefore inadmissible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. the testimony is inadmissible because specific instances of conduct is an improper method of proving character.",
