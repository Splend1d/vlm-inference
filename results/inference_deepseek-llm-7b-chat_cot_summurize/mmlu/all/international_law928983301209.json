There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law\nB. Treaties supersede custom\nC. Custom supersedes treaties\nD. General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Treaties supersede custom.\n\nInternational law is made up of a number of different sources, including treaties, custom, and general principles of law. Treaties are formal agreements between nations that are negotiated and ratified by the parties involved. Custom is a form of law that is based on the long-standing practice and usage of nations and is considered to be an important source of international law. General principles of law are a set of principles that are widely accepted and applied by nations in their dealings with one another.\n\nTreaties are considered to be the highest form of international law and have the greatest weight and authority. This is because treaties are formal agreements that are negotiated and ratified by the parties involved. Treaties are also considered to be more stable and predictable than custom because they are more likely to be negotiated with the intention of creating a lasting agreement.\n\nCustom is the second highest form of international law and has the next greatest weight and authority. Custom is based on the long-standing practice and usage of nations and is considered to be an important source of international law. Custom is considered to be more flexible and adaptable than treaties because it is based on the evolving needs and circumstances of nations.\n\nGeneral principles of law are the lowest form of international law and have the least weight and authority. General principles of law are widely accepted and applied by nations in their dealings with one another, but they are not as formal or binding as treaties or custom.\n\nIn summary, treaties are considered to be the highest form of international law and have the greatest weight and authority. Custom is the second highest form of international law and has the next greatest weight and authority. General principles of law are the lowest form of international law and have the least weight and authority.",
