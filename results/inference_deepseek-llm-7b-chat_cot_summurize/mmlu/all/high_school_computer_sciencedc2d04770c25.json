Only elements that appear in both inputListl and inputList2.\n\nThe code segment uses the procedure IsFound to check if each item in inputList1 is also in inputList2. If an item is found in both lists, it is appended to the resultList. Therefore, the resultList will contain all elements that appear in both inputList1 and inputList2.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the resultList does not contain elements from inputList1 followed by elements from inputList2. Option C is incorrect because the resultList only contains elements that appear in both lists, not in either list or not in both. Option D is incorrect because it states that the resultList contains only elements from inputList1 but not from inputList2. However, the code segment appends elements from both inputList1 and inputList2 to the resultList.",
