May be changed with consumption of oligo-saccharides\n\nassistant:The answer is D. May be changed with consumption of oligo-saccharides. The colonic microbiome is influenced by various factors such as diet, lifestyle, and medication. Consumption of oligo-saccharides, a type of dietary fiber found in fruits, vegetables, and grains, can help to maintain the balance of the colonic microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics can also play a role in shaping the composition of the colonic microbiome.",
