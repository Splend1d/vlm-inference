Which of the following represents the order of growth of T(n) as a function of n?\n\nA. \u0398(n)\nB. \u0398(n log n)\nC. \u0398(n^2)\nD. \u0398(n^2 log n)\n\nassistant:The order of growth of a function describes how the function's value grows as n grows. In other words, it tells us how the number of function calls grows as the input size grows.\n\nFor the function T(n), we need to analyze its growth pattern. Let's look at the recursive definition of T(n):\n\nT(n + 1) = 3n + T(n)\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nT(n + 1) - 3n = T(n)\n\nNow, let's analyze the growth of T(n) itself:\n\nT(n) = 7\n\nT(n - 1) = 3(n - 1) + T(n - 1)\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\nT(n - 1) - 3(n - 1) = T(n - 1)\n\nNow we can see that the growth of T(n) is the same as the growth of T(n - 1), and the same pattern continues for each value of n.\n\nAs we continue to analyze the growth of T(n), we can see that the term 3n in T(n + 1) - 3n grows linearly with n. The constant term, T(n), grows linearly as well. Since the linear term (3n) dominates the growth of the function, we can say that the growth of T(n) is roughly proportional to n.\n\nTherefore, the order of growth of T(n) is O(n), which corresponds to option A. \u0398(n).",
