Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character does something clearly morally wrong in both scenarios. In Scenario 1, giving the boy allergic to peanuts some butter for his toast could be considered a form of negligence or carelessness, which could lead to harm or even death to the boy. In Scenario 2, picking up a knife to cut the woman lying on the surgical table is a clear violation of medical ethics and could result in serious harm or even death to the patient.
