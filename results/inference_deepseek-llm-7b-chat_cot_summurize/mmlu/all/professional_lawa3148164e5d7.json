The farmer gavea friend a mortgage on the olive grove to secure aloan from the friend to the farmer in the amountof $90,000. The farmer then gave a co-workera mortgage on the olive grove to secure a loanfrom the co-worker to the farmer in the amount of$120,000. The farmer then gave an investor a mortgage on the olive grove to secure a loan from the investor to the farmer in the amount of $110,000. The co-worker then records. The investor then records.

Since the investor's mortgage was recorded last, it has priority over the other mortgages. Therefore, the investor should receive the entire amount from the sale of the olive grove ($220,000.00) minus the amount owed to the co-worker ($120,000.00). The co-worker's mortgage was recorded second, so the farmer owes the co-worker $120,000.00. The farmer owes the friend $90,000.00, as stated in the mortgage agreement. Therefore, the total amount owed to the co-worker and friend is $210,000.00. Subtracting this amount from the sale price of $220,000.00 leaves $10,000.00 remaining for the investor.",
