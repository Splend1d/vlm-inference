Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, \"You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?\" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is\n\nA. admissible as non-hearsay.\nB. admissible, even though it is hearsay.\nC. admissible under the excited utterance exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.\n\nassistant:D. inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.\n\nThe pedestrian's statement is inadmissible because it is not admissible as non-hearsay and the pedestrian is not present at trial. Hearsay is a statement that is made out of court and offered in court for the truth of the matter asserted. Since the pedestrian's statement was not made in court, it is hearsay. Additionally, the pedestrian cannot be identified, making it impossible for the statement to be considered as an excited utterance. An excited utterance is a statement that is made in the heat of the moment immediately after the incident, but the pedestrian's statement is not clear about when it was made, and it is not clear if it was made in the heat of the moment. Therefore, the pedestrian's statement is inadmissible in court.",
