Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\n\nThe state education agency obtained the land through eminent domain, and the landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal. According to the statute, the agency should have implemented an educational use for the land within 15 years. However, the agency did not use the land for educational purposes, and in year 16, it abandoned the intended educational use and sold the property at a properly advertised auction under state law.\n\nThe original landowner appealed, arguing that the agency only took a fee simple determinable and when it ceased its intended educational use, superior fee simple title reverted back to the original owner. However, the state education agency also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession. Therefore, the appellate court is unlikely to rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer. Instead, they are more likely to rule that the landowner's appeal is not successful, as the agency obtained fee simple title through both eminent domain and adverse possession.",
