The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence.

The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\nA. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\nB. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\nC. No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\nD. No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n\nThe reason for this is that the man was married to his first wife and was not legally divorced, therefore he could not marry the second woman. This means that he never had good title to the property as a tenant by the entirety, and the property was considered to be owned by both him and his purported second wife as tenants in common.\n\nThe fact that he was convicted of murder does not change the legal ownership of the property, but rather affects his rights as an individual. The estate of the decedent, who was the purported second wife, could bring a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. However, this does not give the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it assumes that the murderer's criminal act automatically results in the forfeiture of his rights to the property, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it suggests that the court will recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common, but this is not supported by the facts presented in the question.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it fails to acknowledge the fact that the man was a bigamist, which affects the legal ownership of the property.",
