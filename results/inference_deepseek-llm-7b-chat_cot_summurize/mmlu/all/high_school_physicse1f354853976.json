Therefore, this option is equal to one tesla.\n\nB. 1 kg/(C*s)\nThis option represents the definition of one gauss. One gauss is equal to 1 kg/(C*s), which is not equal to one tesla.\n\nC. 1 N/(A*m)\nThis option is the definition of one volt. One volt is equal to 1 N/(A*m). Therefore, this option is equal to one volt, not one tesla.\n\nD. 1 A*N/V\nThis option is not a valid unit of measurement. It appears to be a combination of units that do not make sense. Therefore, it is not equal to one tesla.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. 1 A*N/V is NOT equal to one tesla.",
