Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company.

Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible as a vicarious admission.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.\n\nassistant:The engineer's deposition testimony would be considered admissible as former testimony (A) under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Former testimony is defined as \"any statement, other than an admission in litigation, offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Since the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial, his deposition testimony from his wrongful termination lawsuit would be considered former testimony and therefore admissible.\n\nA vicarious admission (B) is not applicable in this case, as it refers to a statement made by one party that is intended to benefit another party. The engineer's deposition was not made on behalf of the company.\n\nThe statement being offered is not hearsay (C), as it is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted by the person making the statement. The engineer's deposition testimony is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted by the company, which is that the engineer's statements prove the company's submission of false safety reports.\n\nLastly, the trial court judge would not rule the engineer's deposition inadmissible (D) because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered. The Federal Rules of Evidence allow former testimony to be admitted if the party against whom the statement is offered had an opportunity to conduct discovery on the matter being testified to. In this case, the engineer's deposition was taken during the discovery stage of litigation, which means the company had the opportunity to conduct discovery on the matter being testified to.",
