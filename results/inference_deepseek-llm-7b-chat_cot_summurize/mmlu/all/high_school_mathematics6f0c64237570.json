What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $C$?\n\nA. 145\nB. 90\nC. 60\nD. 70\n\nassistant:In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Since angle $B$ measures $110^\\circ$, angle $D$ also measures $110^\\circ$. The sum of the measures of angles $B$ and $D$ is $220^\\circ$. Since angle $B$ is $110^\\circ$, angle $C$ measures $220^\\circ - 110^\\circ = 110^\\circ$. Therefore, the measure of angle $C$ is $\\boxed{110^\\circ}$.\nThe answer is: 110",
