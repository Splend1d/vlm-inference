The group that gauged the emotional impact remembered many more words. This is evidence that better retention results with attention to\n\nA. semantic features\nB. echoic features\nC. shallow processing\nD. surface processing\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. semantic features.\n\nThe given information suggests that paying attention to semantic features (such as the meaning of words) leads to better retention than paying attention to other features. In the experiment, the group that listened for emotional impact remembered more words than the group that focused on sounds. This suggests that paying attention to the meaning of words (semantic features) leads to better retention than paying attention to other features (echoic features, shallow processing, or surface processing).",
