Scenario 1 | I urinated into a cup so I could test it for infection. Scenario 2 | I fed the hungry child some warm soup.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:In Scenario 1, the main character urinates into a cup in order to test it for infection. This action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In this scenario, the main character is willingly contaminating a potentially sterile object (the cup) for the purpose of obtaining a sample, which is then used to test for infection. This could potentially lead to someone else becoming infected, which is a morally wrong action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character feeds a hungry child some warm soup. This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Providing food to a hungry person is generally considered a morally good action, as it helps to alleviate suffering and promote well-being.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
