Lumbar puncture\n\nassistant:The most appropriate next step in diagnosis for this patient would be a CT scan of the head. The patient's symptoms, including word-finding difficulty, weakness, and sensory loss in the right arm and leg, are consistent with a possible stroke. A CT scan of the head can help determine if there is evidence of a clot or other abnormality in the brain that may be causing these symptoms. Additionally, the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, which is a risk factor for stroke, further supports the need for further evaluation.",
