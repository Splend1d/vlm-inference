Real GDP will increase by $12 million.\n\nassistant:The overall impact of the government's actions on real GDP in country Z would depend on various factors such as the composition of the spending and tax changes, as well as the responsiveness of the economy to these changes.\n\nHowever, assuming that the government's spending is focused on productive investments that increase productivity and growth, and that the tax increase is not so high as to discourage economic activity, it is possible that the overall impact on real GDP could be positive.\n\nIn this case, if the government increases spending by $12 million and raises tax collections by the same amount, the net effect on government spending could be neutral, with no change in the level of government spending on GDP. However, if the increased spending is targeted at productive investments that increase economic growth, then the overall impact on real GDP could be positive.\n\nIn summary, it is not possible to definitively determine the overall impact of these moves on real GDP without more information about the specific spending and tax changes, as well as the responsiveness of the economy to these changes.",
