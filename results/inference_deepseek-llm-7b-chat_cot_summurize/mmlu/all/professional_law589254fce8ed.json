On appeal, Defendant moves for a new trial, claiming that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Which of the following facts, if proven, would provide the best grounds to substantiate Defendant's ineffectiveness of counsel claim?\n\nA. The trial attorney lied to Defendant about her criminal trial experience.\nB. The trial attorney failed to interview an alibi witness.\nC. The trial attorney did not consult Defendant about her trial strategy.\nD. The trial attorney did not believe in Defendant's innocence.\n\nassistant:The best ground to substantiate Defendant's ineffectiveness of counsel claim would be if the trial attorney lied to Defendant about her criminal trial experience. This is because it would show that the attorney did not provide Defendant with accurate information, which would have allowed Defendant to make informed decisions about his defense. The other options do not necessarily show that the attorney was ineffective. For example, failing to interview an alibi witness or not consulting Defendant about trial strategy may be mistakes, but they do not necessarily mean that the attorney was ineffective. Finally, the fact that the attorney did not believe in Defendant's innocence does not necessarily mean that the attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel.",
