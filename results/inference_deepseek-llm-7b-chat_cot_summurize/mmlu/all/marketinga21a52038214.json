Brand loyalty\nB. Brand mark\nC. Trade name\nD. Trademark\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Trademark.\n\nA brand mark, trade name, or brand loyalty do not provide legal protection or exclusive rights to use a brand. A trademark, on the other hand, is a legal protection that gives the owner exclusive rights by law to use a brand. This can include the use of logos, symbols, words, or a combination of these elements to identify and distinguish a product or service from those of others. Trademark registration is usually required to fully protect a brand and prevent others from using similar marks that may cause confusion among consumers.",
