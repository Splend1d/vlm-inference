A group of thirty fraternity brothers from Penn State: This sample is highly biased towards a specific group of male college students (fraternity members at Penn State) and does not represent the diversity of male college students across different universities.\n\nB. A random sample taken between classes in the business wing of various universities: This sample might be more representative since it would include male college students from various universities, but it may not be as diverse as desired since it only represents students in the business wing.\n\nC. Sixty male members of each class from Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Columbia: This sample is highly biased towards students from a small number of prestigious universities and does not represent the diversity of male college students across different colleges and universities.\n\nD. Twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities: This sample is likely the most representative since it includes male college students from various colleges and universities, which would provide a more diverse and accurate representation of the target population.\n\nBased on this analysis, option D. Twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities would be considered most representative of male college students.",
