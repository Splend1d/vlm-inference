In this case, the \"c\" represents the consonant sound that distinguishes \"cat\" from \"dog\" and \"god.\"\n\nB. morpheme is incorrect because a morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language, such as a word or a part of a word. In this case, the \"c\" in \"cat\" is not a morpheme because it is not a meaningful unit on its own.\n\nC. holophrase is incorrect because a holophrase is a word that functions as a complete unit of meaning, without any internal word boundaries. \"Cat\" is not a holophrase because it is made up of two distinct syllables (cat).\n\nD. syllable is incorrect because a syllable is a sequence of speech sounds that forms a unit of meaning in a language. In this case, the \"cat\" consists of one syllable, but the \"c\" is not a syllable because it is not a meaningful unit of sound on its own.",
