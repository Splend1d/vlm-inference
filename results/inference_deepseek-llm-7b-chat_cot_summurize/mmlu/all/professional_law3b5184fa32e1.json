In 1960, the shopkeeper conveyed the property by general warranty deed as follows: \"The grantor hereby conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25. \" At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single. Thereafter, the sister married and had two sons. Subsequently, one son died in an automobile accident. Three years after that son's death, the sister had a daughter.

Since the sister is the grantor's parent, the condition applies to the children of the sister as well. The sister married and had two sons and a daughter. The deceased son was not mentioned to be born before 1960, so he is not considered in this condition. Therefore, the condition applies to the remaining children of the sister, who are the friend, the son, and the daughter.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. the friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born during her lifetime.",
