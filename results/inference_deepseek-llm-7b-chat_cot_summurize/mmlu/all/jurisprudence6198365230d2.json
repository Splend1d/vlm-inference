Happiness is less important than economic prosperity.\nB. It is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's acts.\nC. Pain and pleasure are inevitable features of life.\nD. Utilitarianism fails to take account of differences in social background.\n\nassistant:The most powerful refutation of Bentham's felicific calculus is that it is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's acts. This is because Bentham's felicific calculus assumes that it is possible to calculate the exact amount of happiness that would result from any given action, which is not possible in reality. Additionally, Bentham's calculus does not account for the fact that some actions may have unintended consequences that cannot be predicted or measured. Therefore, option B is the most powerful refutation of Bentham's felicific calculus.",
