Thomas Malthus\nB. Josiah Child\nC. Adam Smith\nD. Jean-Baptiste Colbert\n\nassistant:The 1651 Navigation Acts above conflict with the economic philosopher's theory and beliefs of Thomas Malthus. These acts imposed restrictions on trade between England, Ireland, and other lands or territories, limiting the importation of goods from Asia, Africa, and America. They also required that goods be imported only in ships belonging to the English people or their plantations, and that the master and mariners were also of the English people. These acts reflect a mercantilist economic approach, which was also advocated by Thomas Malthus. Malthus believed in the importance of national economic self-sufficiency and the control of trade to maintain national power and security. The acts' restrictions on trade and the control of trade to the benefit of the English people and their colonies align with Malthus's views on mercantilism.\n\nJosiah Child, Adam Smith, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert are not mentioned in the passage, and thus, they do not conflict with the 1651 Navigation Acts.",
