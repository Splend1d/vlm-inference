For triggered source volume of 15 V and allowable gate power dissipation of 0.5 W compute the gate source resistance?\n\nA. 111.9 ohm\nB. 11.19 ohm\nC. 108 ohm\nD. 115 ohm\n\nassistant:To calculate the gate-source resistance, we can use the following formula:\n\nRs = 1 / (Vgs / Ics)\n\nwhere Rs is the gate-source resistance, Vgs is the Vgs voltage, and Ics is the current through the SCR.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that the SCR cathode characteristic is a straight line with a gradient of 130. This means that the Ics current is proportional to the Vgs voltage, so we can write:\n\nIcs = k * Vgs\n\nwhere k is a constant. We can find the value of k by differentiating the slope equation:\n\nd(Ics) / d(Vgs) = k\n\nDifferentiating the straight line equation with respect to Vgs:\n\nd(Ics) / d(Vgs) = 130\n\nSo, k = 130.\n\nNow we can calculate Rs:\n\nRs = 1 / (15 / (130 * 130))\nRs = 1 / (15 / 16900)\nRs = 1 / 0.00918\nRs \u2248 112.6 ohm\n\nThe closest answer to this value is option D, with a gate-source resistance of 115 ohm.",
