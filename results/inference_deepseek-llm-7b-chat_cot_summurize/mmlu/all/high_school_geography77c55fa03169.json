Secularism is the principle that the state should not favor or endorse any particular religion, and that religious matters should be separate from civil matters. This concept is often associated with the separation of church and state, and is reflected in laws and policies that promote religious freedom and equality.\n\nOption B, heathenism, refers to the worship of ancient gods and goddesses, and is not synonymous with secularism. Option C, sacrilege, refers to the act of showing disrespect for religious beliefs, and is not the same as secularism. Option D, nationalism, refers to the promotion of a country or nation's interests and identity, and is not related to secularism.",
