What is x << 3 in Python 3?\n\nA. 1\nB. 3\nC. 8\nD. 16\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first need to interpret the user's input. The user wants to find the result of `x << 3` where `x = 1`.\n\nIn Python 3, the `<<` operator is used for bitwise left shift. The right operand is shifted to the left by the number of bits specified by the left operand. The sign of the right operand is determined by the sign of the left operand.\n\nIn this case, `x = 1` and we are shifting it three places to the left.\n\nTo calculate `1 << 3`, we will shift the 1 three places to the left:\n\n1 (10000000 in binary) << 3 (00000010 in binary) = 8 (10000000 in binary)\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. 8",
