Left ventricle \u2192 aorta \u2192 arteries \u2192 veins \u2192 capillaries.\n\nThe systemic circulation is the pathway of blood flow in the cardiovascular system of a human or animal. It starts in the left ventricle of the heart and ends in the capillaries, where oxygen and nutrients are exchanged with the cells. The blood then returns to the heart through the veins, and is pumped back to the lungs to be reoxygenated.",
