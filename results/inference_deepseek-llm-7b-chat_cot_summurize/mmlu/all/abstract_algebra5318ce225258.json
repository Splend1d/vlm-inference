A free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of generators, and every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.\n\nStatement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases. This statement is also true. A free abelian group of rank at least 2 is a free abelian group that has at least two generators, and every such group has an infinite number of bases.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A.
