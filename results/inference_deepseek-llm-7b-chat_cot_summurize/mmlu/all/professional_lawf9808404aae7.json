The note states: \"The demon compels me to kill my former employer.

In this case, the former girlfriend is able to identify the handwriting on the note as belonging to the defendant, making her an authenticating witness. Therefore, the defendant's attorney's objection is not valid and the judge should allow the former girlfriend's testimony to be presented as evidence.",
