The SCNT individual has no genetic material.\nD. There is no significant difference.\n\nassistant:A. The SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person instead of two.\n\nThe main difference between a cloned (SCNT) individual and an individual who is a product of normal sexual reproduction is that the cloned individual has genetic material primarily from one person (the donor cell) instead of two (the genetic material from both parents). In normal sexual reproduction, the genetic material is contributed by two parents, resulting in a mixture of genetic material from both parents in the offspring.\n\nIn cloning, a single cell (the donor cell) is used to create a new individual by essentially duplicating the DNA from the donor cell. This process is called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and is the method used in cloning animals like Dolly the sheep. In this case, the genetic material comes from a single person, resulting in an individual that is an exact genetic copy of the donor cell.",
