I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. I and II only\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the implications of Harlow's study on human behavior. Harlow's study was conducted on baby monkeys and aimed to understand the impact of maternal care on their development. The artificial mothers used in the study provided either a \"wire\" or \"soft\" surrogate, which differed in terms of their texture. The results of the study showed that the baby monkeys preferred the soft surrogate over the wire one, indicating that physical touch was crucial for their development.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. I only: This option suggests that only the implications for humans related to the first part of the question (implications of Harlow's study) are mentioned. This is not entirely correct, as the implications for humans are mentioned in the question itself, not just in the first part.\n\nB. II only: This option suggests that only the implications for humans related to the second part of the question (implications of Harlow's study for humans) are mentioned. This is not entirely correct, as the implications for humans are mentioned in the question itself, not just in the second part.\n\nC. III only: This option suggests that only the implications for humans related to the third part of the question (implications of Harlow's study for humans) are mentioned. This is not entirely correct, as the implications for humans are mentioned in the question itself, not just in the third part.\n\nD. I and II only: This option suggests that the implications for humans related to the first and second parts of the question (implications of Harlow's study for humans) are mentioned. This is the correct answer, as the implications for humans are mentioned in the question itself, and the first and second parts of the question refer to the same study.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II only.",
