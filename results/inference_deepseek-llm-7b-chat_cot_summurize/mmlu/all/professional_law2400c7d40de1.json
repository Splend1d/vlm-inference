The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n\nThis rule of law applies to the situation described in the question. The senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization during a legislative hearing. This type of statement is protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. Therefore, it would not be a denial of due process or First Amendment rights for the senator to make such statements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question does not involve a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Option B is incorrect because the question does not involve a congressman being questioned in another place for his speech or debate during a congressional hearing. Option C is incorrect because the question does not involve a defamation suit, so the constitutional requirement for actual malice is not applicable.",
