A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus.\n\nThis is because algal blooms are often triggered by an increase in the availability of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in the water. When these nutrients are present in high concentrations, they can promote the rapid growth of phytoplankton, which can then die off and decompose, depleting the oxygen in the water. This can lead to the formation of dead zones.\n\nOption A is not a likely trigger for algal blooms, as a decrease in light level would actually slow down the growth of phytoplankton. Option B, increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton, could actually help to control the growth of phytoplankton by reducing their numbers. Option D, decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton, also does not explain why algal blooms would occur.",
