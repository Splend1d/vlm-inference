None of above.\n\nThe Ward-Leonard system is a speed control method for induction motors, but the options provided do not directly relate to the lower limit of speed imposed by the system. Instead, the lower limit of speed imposed by the Ward-Leonard system is determined by the mechanical design of the motor and the control circuitry used to implement the system.",
