Current liabilities were $322000. What was the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses?\n\nA. $322,000\nB. $644,000\nC. $966,000\nD. 1288000\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the information given about the current ratio and quick ratio to find the total amount of inventory and prepaid expenses.\n\nThe current ratio is the reciprocal of the quick ratio, so if the quick ratio is 1-to-1, the current ratio is 1/1 = 1-to-1. This means that the current assets equal the current liabilities.\n\nThe current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities, so we can write the equation:\n\nCurrent ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities\n3-to-1 = Current assets / $322,000\n\nTo solve for the current assets, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $322,000:\n\n$322,000 * 3-to-1 = Current assets\n$966,000 = Current assets\n\nNow we know that the current assets equal $966,000. Since the current ratio is 1-to-1, we can also say that the current assets equal the current liabilities, so:\n\n$966,000 = Current liabilities\n\nNow we need to find the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses. The current ratio equation tells us that the current assets equal the current liabilities, so the current assets minus the current liabilities will give us the inventory and prepaid expenses:\n\n$966,000 - $322,000 = $644,000\n\nSo, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000. The answer is B.",
