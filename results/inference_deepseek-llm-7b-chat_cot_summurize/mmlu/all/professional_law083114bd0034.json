Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it is land that would be fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber. The grantor conveyed his tract to his brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother's cutting of the timber on the section of tract suitable for cultivation would be an example of\n\nA. permissive waste.\nB. ameliorative waste.\nC. equitable waste.\nD. unreasonable exploitation.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of waste in land law. Waste refers to the unauthorized removal or destruction of natural resources, such as trees, from land. It can be either permissive waste, ameliorative waste, equitable waste, or unreasonable exploitation.\n\nPermissive waste occurs when a landowner, with the permission of the fee simple owner, removes waste from the land. Ameliorative waste occurs when a landowner, with the permission of the fee simple owner, removes waste from the land to improve the land. Equitable waste occurs when a landowner, without permission, removes waste from the land, but the fee simple owner permits the removal. Unreasonable exploitation occurs when a landowner, without permission, removes waste from the land and the fee simple owner does not permit the removal.\n\nIn the given scenario, the brother cleared 40 acres of timber from the section of the tract suitable for cultivation. This would be an example of permissive waste, as he had the permission of the grantor to clear the timber. The grantor conveyed the tract to his brother for life, and it is reasonable to assume that the brother had the authority to clear the timber from the tract. The brother also cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, but since he did not have permission from the grantor to clear this area, this would be an example of unreasonable exploitation.\n\nSo, the answer is A. permissive waste.",
