Each box has 4 packages with 7 shirts in each package. The expression 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7) can be used to find the total number of shirts. Which expression can also be used to find the total number of shirts?\n\nA. 12 \u00d7 3\nB. 12 \u00d7 7\nC. 28 \u00d7 4\nD. 28 \u00d7 7\n\nassistant:To find the total number of shirts, you can use the expression 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7), which equals 84. This is the number of shirts in one box of shirts. Since there are 3 boxes, the total number of shirts is 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7) = 168.\n\nTo find the total number of shirts using a different expression, you can use the expression 28 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7). This expression is equal to 672. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 28 \u00d7 7.",
