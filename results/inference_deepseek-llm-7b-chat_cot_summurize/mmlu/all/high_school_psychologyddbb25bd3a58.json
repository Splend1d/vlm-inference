It secretes hormones that regulate many other endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and pancreas. The pituitary gland also plays a role in growth and development, and helps regulate the body's response to stress.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. thyroid gland: While the thyroid gland does produce hormones that regulate metabolism and growth, it is not the gland referred to as the \"master gland.\"\n\nB. pancreas: The pancreas is an organ that produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon, but it is not the gland referred to as the \"master gland.\"\n\nD. adrenal gland: The adrenal glands produce hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, but they are not the gland referred to as the \"master gland.\"",
