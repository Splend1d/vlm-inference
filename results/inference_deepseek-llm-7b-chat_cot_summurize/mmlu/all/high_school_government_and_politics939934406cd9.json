Wainwright, the Supreme Court ruled that criminal defendants in state cases have the right to representation by an attorney. This ruling was made in 1963 and it established the right to counsel as a fundamental component of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision was based on the principle that a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial and to avoid self-incrimination cannot be guaranteed without the presence of an attorney.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is A. to representation by an attorney.",
