Warm. Bladder washout solution should be warm, as it helps to dilate the bladder neck and relax the muscles in the bladder, making it easier to empty the bladder. Cold or refrigerated solutions can cause the muscles in the bladder to contract, making it more difficult to empty the bladder. Room temperature solutions are generally not recommended for bladder washouts.",
