This is because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at the hiker, which could have resulted in the hiker being injured or even killed. The fact that the gun did not go off is irrelevant in this context, as the hiker's main concern is the potential danger posed by the hunter's rifle. The hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary, but this does not excuse the hiker's assertion of a claim for assault.",
