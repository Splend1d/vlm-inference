This is because helium-neon lasers emit light at a specific wavelength range, which is particularly useful for spectroscopic analysis. Dye lasers and ruby lasers emit light at shorter wavelengths, which are outside the visible spectrum, while excimer lasers emit ultraviolet light. Therefore, a helium-neon laser is the best choice for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths.",
