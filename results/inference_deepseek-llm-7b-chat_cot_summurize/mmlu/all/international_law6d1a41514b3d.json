No, all States are considered equal as sovereign States (the principle of sovereign equality, enshrined in article 2, para 1 UN Charter)\nD. Whether there will be any hierarchy among States is a matter of each international organization to decide\n\nassistant:I will evaluate the given options based on the principle of sovereign equality, which is enshrined in Article 2, paragraph 1 of the United Nations Charter. According to this principle, all member states are considered equal, with no privileges or immunities.\n\nA. This option suggests that founding members have more powers and authority. However, the principle of sovereign equality does not differentiate between founding members and other member states.\n\nB. This option suggests that the Permanent Five Members of the UN Security Council are in a superior position. This contradicts the principle of sovereign equality as it creates a hierarchy among member states.\n\nC. This option states that all states are considered equal. This aligns with the principle of sovereign equality, which does not differentiate between member states.\n\nD. This option suggests that the hierarchy among states depends on each international organization. However, the principle of sovereign equality applies universally to all member states in the United Nations.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is option C. The principle of sovereign equality does not create any hierarchy among States.",
