This means that if a witness makes a prior statement that is consistent with their current testimony, the court may allow the prior statement to be admitted as evidence. In this case, the expert witness had previously told another surgeon that the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident, which is consistent with his trial testimony. Therefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection and admit the testimony.\n\nA. sustains the objection because the testimony is hearsay. This is not correct because the rule of rehabilitation allows for the admission of prior consistent statements.\nC. sustains the objection because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony. This is not correct because the rule of rehabilitation allows for the admission of prior consistent statements.\nD. overrules the objection because the expert's statement is a statement against interest. This is not correct because the rule of rehabilitation allows for the admission of prior consistent statements, regardless of whether they are statements against interest.",
