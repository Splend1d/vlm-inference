These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical.

With respect to the 50-acre tract that the country club purchased from the land-development company, which of the following most accurately describes the deed restrictions (1) and (2)?\n\nA. Affirmative covenant(s).\nB. Equitable easement(s).\nC. Express easement(s) appurtenant.\nD. Equitable servitude(s).\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Equitable easement(s). \n\nExplanation: An equitable easement is a right to use another's land for a limited purpose, which is created by custom or implication, not by a formal grant or conveyance. In this case, the land-development company created an equitable easement when it conveyed the 50-acre tract to the country club, allowing the country club to use the land for a country club and a residential subdivision. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Affirmative covenant(s) is a term used in real estate law to describe a restrictive covenant that is imposed by a deed or other instrument. In this case, the deed contains restrictive covenants that apply to the land, but they are not affirmative covenants.\n\nC. Express easement(s) appurtenant refers to an easement created by a deed or other formal instrument. However, the deed in this case does not create an express easement appurtenant.\n\nD. Equitable servitude(s) refers to a right to use another's land for a particular purpose, which is created by custom or law and not by a formal grant or conveyance. In this case, the equitable servitude created by the deed allows the country club to use the land for a country club and a residential subdivision.",
