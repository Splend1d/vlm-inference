The Moon does not rotate.\n\nThe Moon has a synchronous rotation, which means that its rotation is synchronized with its orbit around the Earth. As a result, the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth, giving us the appearance of seeing the same face of the Moon at all times.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Moon's orbit around the Earth is an ellipse, not a circle.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the other face of the Moon does not point toward us only at new moon. The same side of the Moon always faces the Earth, regardless of the Moon's phase.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Moon's rotational and orbital periods are not equal. The Moon's rotation is synchronous, which means it takes the same amount of time for the Moon to rotate once on its axis as it does to complete one orbit around the Earth. However, the time it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around the Earth is slightly longer than the time it takes to rotate once on its axis.",
