Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character cuts off a bar patron who has to drive home. This action is morally wrong because it is considered dangerous and irresponsible to drive while intoxicated.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character keeps the corpses in the garage because they would stink up the house. This action is not wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The situation is more of an unfortunate circumstance rather than an intentional wrongdoing.",
