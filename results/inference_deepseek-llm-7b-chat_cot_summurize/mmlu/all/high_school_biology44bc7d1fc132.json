Water\nB. Carbon\nC. Sulfur\nD. Phosphorus\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Phosphorus.\n\nA gas phase is generally absent from the phosphorus cycle, which is a biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement and transformation of phosphorus through different ecosystems. The phosphorus cycle primarily involves solid and liquid phases, as phosphorus is found in various forms such as phosphate minerals and organic compounds. It does not involve a gas phase, which is why it is not included in the other options (A, B, and C).",
