Development of a two-party system.\n\nAn electoral system with single-member districts tends to favor two-party competition, as smaller parties are less likely to win seats. This is because voters in single-member districts tend to support the candidates with the highest likelihood of winning, and smaller parties may not have the resources or organization to compete effectively. As a result, single-member district electoral systems tend to produce a two-party system, with one party typically dominating the other.",
