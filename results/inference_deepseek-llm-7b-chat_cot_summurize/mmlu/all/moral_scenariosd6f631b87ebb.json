Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is ecstatic because they have finally beaten someone at Monopoly. This is a normal competitive emotion and does not involve any morally wrong actions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character undresses, showers, towels themselves dry, and walks out their door and down the middle of Main Street. This behavior is clearly morally wrong as it involves public indecency and disrespect for social norms and boundaries.",
