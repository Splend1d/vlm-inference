The rule against perpetuities.\n\nUnder common law principles, a deed conveying property to the heirs of the grantor is not effective. This is known as the rule against perpetuities. The rule against perpetuities prevents the creation of estates that do not come to an end within a certain period, which varies by jurisdiction. In this case, the conveyance to the heirs results in a life estate for Friend with a reversion back to the Owner, which does not come to an end within a certain period. Therefore, the rule against perpetuities applies, and the result is due to this common law doctrine.\n\nA. The rule in Shelly's case is a specific example of the rule against perpetuities and is not the doctrine itself.\nB. The doctrine of concurrent ownership refers to the concurrent possession of property by multiple parties. This is not related to the conveyance of property by deed.\nC. The doctrine of worthier title refers to a situation where a person claiming to have a better title to property is able to establish that title. This is not related to the conveyance of property by deed.",
