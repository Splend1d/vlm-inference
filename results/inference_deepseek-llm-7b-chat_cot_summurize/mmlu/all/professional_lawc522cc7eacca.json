The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\n\nThe woman constructed a drainage system that caused the land to settle, which resulted in damage to the sister's land. The sister is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition, which means she is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the settlement. The other options are incorrect because lateral support is not relevant in this case, improved condition support is not applicable since the sister did not improve her land, and negligence in constructing the drainage system is not a requirement for the sister to recover compensation.",
