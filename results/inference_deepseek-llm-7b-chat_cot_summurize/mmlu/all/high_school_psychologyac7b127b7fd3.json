This is because he has already done well in AP Psychology and has high achievement motivation, which means he is likely to seek out challenging and rewarding learning experiences. Choosing an upper-level undergraduate course will allow him to continue learning and growing in his understanding of psychology, while also providing a challenge that he is likely to excel at.",
