The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n\nThe statute of limitations for adverse possession in the Midwestern state where the property is located is 20 years. The son has occupied the property for the past 25 years, which is longer than the statute of limitations. Therefore, he has a strong case for claiming the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The daughter cannot acquire title by adverse possession against the son because they are cotenants, not adverse possessors.\n\nB. There is no evidence that the son's acts do not constitute an ouster. The son has paid taxes and maintained the property, which suggests that he has taken control of the property and is asserting his rights as an owner.\n\nC. There is no evidence that the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate. She has not pressed her brother about the property and has not demanded any rent or compensation.",
