The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. $10,000. 00\nC. $18,000. 00\nD. $24,000. 00\n\nassistant:The plaintiff's proper recovery in this case is $18,000.00.\n\nThe youth purchased the sports car for $36,000 and made payments of $1,000 per month for three years, which totals $36,000 - $12,000 (payments made during the first year) - $1,000 x 12 months (payments made during the second year) = $16,000. The remaining balance due under the contract is $16,000.\n\nHowever, the youth offered to pay the dealership $10,000 if he found a job within a month. The youth also claimed that the car was a \"real lemon\" and that he spent a considerable sum on repairs. The dealership's actual damages are the sales price of $36,000 less the payments made by the youth, which is $36,000 - $16,000 = $20,000.\n\nThe youth was involved in an accident and the sports car was totally demolished. The youth refused to make any more payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. The youth's defense is that the sports car was not worth the sales price and that he should only be liable for its value at the time of the accident.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff's proper recovery is the actual damages suffered by the dealership, which is $20,000, less the value of the sports car at the time of the accident, which is $18,000. The plaintiff's proper recovery is $20,000 - $18,000 = $2,000.00.\n\nThe answer is C. $18,000.00.",
