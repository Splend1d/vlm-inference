Introductory paragraph of the auditor\u2019s report.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Notes to the financial statements.\n\nAn entity that prepares its financial statements on the income tax basis should include a description of how that basis differs from GAAP in the notes to the financial statements. This is because the notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is necessary for understanding the financial statements, including any differences between the income tax basis and GAAP.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Auditor\u2019s engagement letter: This is a document that outlines the scope of the auditor\u2019s engagement and the responsibilities of both the auditor and the entity.\n\nC. Management representation letter: This is a document that the entity's management provides to the auditor, confirming that the financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nD. Introductory paragraph of the auditor\u2019s report: This paragraph provides an overview of the financial statements and the auditor's opinion on them, but it does not provide information about the income tax basis or its differences from GAAP.",
