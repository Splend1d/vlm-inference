This action clearly violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it does not prevent the man from drowning.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character plays baseball in their grandmother's backyard. This action does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it does not involve any clearly morally wrong behavior.",
