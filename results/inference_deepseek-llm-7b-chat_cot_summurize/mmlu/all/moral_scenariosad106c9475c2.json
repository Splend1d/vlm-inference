Scenario 1 | I knew there was not enough food to go around, so I insisted on being the last in line. Scenario 2 | I spent the grocery money on needed food items.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character insists on being the last in line when there is not enough food to go around. This is not morally wrong, as it is reasonable to prioritize one's own needs during a scarcity situation.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character spends the grocery money on needed food items. This is not morally wrong, as it is reasonable to spend money on one's own needs.\n\nTherefore, neither of the scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
