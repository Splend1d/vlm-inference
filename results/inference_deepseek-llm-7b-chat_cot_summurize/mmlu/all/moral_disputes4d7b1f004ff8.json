This is distinct from virtue, which refers to the moral qualities and actions that make someone worthy of praise. Beauty is a quality that pleases the senses, while praiseworthiness refers to the quality that deserves praise. Dignity, however, is an inherent quality of the human person that makes them worthy of respect and consideration, regardless of their actions.",
