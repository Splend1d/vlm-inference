Digitizing one input takes 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time.\n2. Five CPU instructions are executed for each signal digitized.\n3. Averaging each set of four samples takes 10 CPU instructions.\n\nFirst, let's find the total time for digitizing and averaging each set of four signals:\n\nDigitizing one input: 12 microseconds\nAveraging one set of four signals: 10 CPU instructions * 1.2 microseconds per instruction = 12 microseconds\n\nTotal time for digitizing and averaging one set of four signals: 12 + 12 = 24 microseconds\n\nNow, let's find the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates.\n\nSince the time for digitizing one input is 12 microseconds and the time for averaging one set of four signals is 12 microseconds, the maximum average instruction execution time should be less than or equal to 24 microseconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 0.8 microseconds.",
