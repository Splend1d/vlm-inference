An increase in the production possibility curve and a rightward shift in long-run aggregate supply.\n\nEconomic growth can be defined as an expansion of the production possibilities of an economy over time. This expansion is characterized by a shift of the production possibilities curve (PPC) to the right, which means that more goods and services can be produced with the same amount of resources. At the same time, the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve shifts to the right, indicating an increase in the total quantity of goods and services produced in the economy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes an increase in the natural rate of unemployment, which is not the same as economic growth. Option B is incorrect because it describes a leftward shift in long-run aggregate supply, which indicates a decrease in the total quantity of goods and services produced in the economy. Option C is also incorrect because it describes a decrease in the production possibility curve and a rightward shift in long-run aggregate supply, which is not the same as economic growth.",
