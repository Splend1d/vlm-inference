Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The statement \"The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated\" is not correct. In mammals, the X chromosome inactivation (X inactivation) process is a way for a normal female cell to silence one of the two X chromosomes during cell division. The silenced X chromosome is retained in most of the cells, while the other X chromosome is expressed. The inactivation of the X chromosome is random, not the same in every cell.",
