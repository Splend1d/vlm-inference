Hitler's attempted collaboration with Italian leader Benito Mussolini\n\nassistant:The historical background for Adolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1 is the widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I. The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I and imposed harsh terms on Germany, was seen as a humiliating defeat for the country. Hitler believed that the treaty forced Germany to accept responsibility for the war and made it difficult for the country to regain its strength and influence in the world. He also felt that the treaty's implementation was not peaceful and that it was forced upon Germany through the use of force and threats. These beliefs led Hitler to reject the treaty and its terms, and to advocate for Germany to regain its power and influence on the world stage.",
