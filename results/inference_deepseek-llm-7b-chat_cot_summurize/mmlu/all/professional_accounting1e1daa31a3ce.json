If X offers three-fourths a share of common stock for each share of Y, the ratio of exchange of market prices would be:\n\nA. 0.667\nB. 1\nC. 1.125\nD. 1.5\n\nassistant:To find the ratio of exchange of market prices, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(Market Price of X) / (Market Price of Y) = (Number of shares of X) / (Number of shares of Y)\n\nGiven that X offers 3/4 of a share of common stock for each share of Y, we can represent the ratio of exchange as:\n\n(Market Price of X) / (Market Price of Y) = (3/4) / 1\n\nNow we just need to find the market prices of X and Y:\n\nMarket Price of X = $45\nMarket Price of Y = ?\n\nLet's assume the market price of Y is $30:\n\n(Market Price of X) / (Market Price of Y) = $45 / $30\n\nNow we can find the ratio of exchange:\n\n(Market Price of X) / (Market Price of Y) = 1.5\n\nThe answer is D. 1.5",
