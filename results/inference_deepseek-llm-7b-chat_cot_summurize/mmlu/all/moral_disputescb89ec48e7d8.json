Wellman is committed to an absurd theory of group membership.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B.\n\nThe example given is to illustrate the difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory. The yoga group has the right to reject prospective members, but they cannot exclude others from using Central Park. This is because Central Park is a public space, and everyone has the right to access it.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Central Park is not a state. Answer C is incorrect because territorial rights do not only belong to individuals, but also to groups and organizations. Answer D is incorrect because the example does not suggest that Wellman is committed to an absurd theory of group membership.",
