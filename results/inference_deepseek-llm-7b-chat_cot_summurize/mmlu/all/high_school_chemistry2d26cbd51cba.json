We want to find the H+ concentration (H+) in the solution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equilibrium constant for phenol, Ka, which can be found using the relationship:\n\nKa = [H+][A] / [HA]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of H+ ions, [A] is the concentration of the acid, and [HA] is the concentration of the conjugated base.\n\nSince we don't have the concentration of the conjugated base, we can assume that it is equal to the concentration of the phenol, which is 1 M. Therefore, Ka = [H+][A] / [HA] = [H+][C6H5OH] / [C6H5OH] = [H+] / 1.\n\nNow we can plug this value of Ka into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = -log([H+]) / (-log(1 \u00d7 10^-10)) = -log([H+]) / (-log(10^-10)) = -log([H+])\n\nSince pH = -log([H+]), we have:\n\n[H+] = 1 / pH\n\nNow we can plug in the given pH value (1 \u00d7 10^-9) and solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 1 / 1 \u00d7 10^-9 = 10^9 M\n\nTherefore, the H+ concentration in the 1.0 M phenol solution is 10^9 M, which corresponds to answer choice B (1 \u00d7 10^-9 M).",
