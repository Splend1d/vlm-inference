Yes, provided that the plaintiff had notice and an opportunity to participate in the testing process.\n\nassistant:C. Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\n\nThe expert's testimony is admissible because it goes to the issue of whether the design defect was the cause of the plaintiff's injury. This is a question of fact for the jury to decide, and the expert's testimony is relevant and helpful in aiding the jury in making that determination. The fact that the manufacturer paid the expert to render his opinion does not render the testimony inadmissible, as long as the expert's methodology was reliable and he was qualified to render the opinion. Therefore, the court should admit the expert's testimony.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court is not the sole decision maker on whether expert testimony is admissible, and the jury is the appropriate body to determine the issue of causation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because paying an expert to render an opinion does not automatically render the testimony inadmissible. The key issue is whether the expert's methodology was reliable and he was qualified to render the opinion.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the plaintiff's notice and participation in the testing process is not a requirement for the expert's testimony to be admissible. The issue is whether the testimony is relevant and helpful to the jury in determining whether the design defect was the cause of the plaintiff's injury.",
