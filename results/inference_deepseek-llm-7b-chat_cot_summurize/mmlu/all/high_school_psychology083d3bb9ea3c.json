Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches. This principle emphasizes the importance of students taking an active role in developing their study skills, rather than relying on a single, specific strategy for all subjects. It also suggests that study skills training should be flexible and adaptable to the needs and preferences of individual students.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that students with disabilities only need a single, specific strategy, which is not always the case. Option B is incorrect because it implies that students with disabilities do not need much guidance or reinforcement from their teachers, which is not true. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that study strategies should only be taught in a small group, which may not be practical in a classroom setting.\n\nTherefore, the school psychologist should stress the importance of helping students to guide their own thinking, organize their own study behaviors, and use varied study approaches in order to improve their study skills.",
