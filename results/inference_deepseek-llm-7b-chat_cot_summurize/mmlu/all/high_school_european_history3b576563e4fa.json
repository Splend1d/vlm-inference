Germans initially claimed a special German mission, but this view changed after World War II. Today, the negative view is more prevalent, and the passage does not support the idea that there has been a longstanding debate or that the question has been answered once and for all. Therefore, the correct answer is A. the notion of a unique German path in history has never been the prevailing public opinion in Germany.",
