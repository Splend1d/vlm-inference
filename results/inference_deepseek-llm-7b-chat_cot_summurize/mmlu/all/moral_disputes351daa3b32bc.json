He argued that individuals who hold the same opinions and beliefs tend to develop similar character traits and behaviors over time. This is known as the \"imitation theory of character\" or \"imitation of opinions.\" According to Aristotle, the opinions and beliefs that an individual holds are the result of imitation, either of the character traits of others or of the character traits that the individual seeks to develop. Therefore, the more an individual imitates similar opinions, the more their character will be shaped by those opinions. This is why Aristotle believed that the development of character is a result of the repetition of similar opinions.",
