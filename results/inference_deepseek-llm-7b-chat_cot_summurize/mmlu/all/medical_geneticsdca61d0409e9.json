Cystic fibrosis\nB. Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nC. Huntington disease\nD. Osteogenesis imperfecta\n\nassistant:C. Huntington disease is caused by a trinucleotide (triplet) repeat expansion. This genetic disorder is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration, leading to difficulties with movement, memory, and cognitive function. The expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene is the primary factor causing Huntington disease.",
