Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\n\nThe government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry because it can lead to higher prices for consumers. When firms collude, they may agree to produce and sell less output, which can drive the price above competitive levels. This can result in a loss of consumer surplus, as consumers are willing to pay more for the product but are unable to do so due to the collusive price.",
