Which molecule would have the shortest bonds?\n\nA. CO2\nB. CO32-\nC. NO2-\nD. NO3-\n\nassistant:To determine which molecule has the shortest bonds, we can compare the bond lengths in the Lewis structures of each molecule.\n\n1. CO2 (carbon dioxide) - Lewis structure:\n- Carbon atom has 4 bonds and 2 shared electrons\n- Oxygen atom has 2 bonds and 2 shared electrons\n- Total valence electrons: 4(C) + 6(O) = 10\n- Hybridization: sp2\n- Bond lengths: C-O = 1.11 \u00c5, C=O = 1.18 \u00c5\n\n2. CO3^2- (carbonate) - Lewis structure:\n- Carbon atom has 3 bonds and 2 shared electrons\n- Oxygen atom has 2 bonds and 2 shared electrons\n- Total valence electrons: 4(C) + 6(O) = 10\n- Hybridization: sp3\n- Bond lengths: C=O = 1.21 \u00c5, C-O = 1.13 \u00c5, O=O = 1.22 \u00c5\n\n3. NO2- (nitrite) - Lewis structure:\n- Nitrogen atom has 3 bonds and 3 shared electrons\n- Oxygen atom has 2 bonds and 2 shared electrons\n- Total valence electrons: 5(N) + 6(O) = 11\n- Hybridization: sp2\n- Bond lengths: C=O = 1.21 \u00c5, N-O = 1.20 \u00c5, O=O = 1.22 \u00c5\n\n4. NO3- (nitrate) - Lewis structure:\n- Nitrogen atom has 4 bonds and 4 shared electrons\n- Oxygen atom has 2 bonds and 2 shared electrons\n- Total valence electrons: 5(N) + 6(O) = 11\n- Hybridization: sp3\n- Bond lengths: C=O = 1.21 \u00c5, N-O = 1.20 \u00c5, O=O = 1.22 \u00c5\n\nComparing the bond lengths, we can see that the shortest bonds are found in CO2 (carbon dioxide) and NO2- (nitrite). The bonds in CO2 and NO2- are both 1.10 \u00c5 long, while the bonds in CO3^2- (carbonate) and NO3- (nitrate) are 1.13 \u00c5 long.\n\nTherefore, the molecule with the shortest bonds is CO2 (carbon dioxide).\n\nA.
