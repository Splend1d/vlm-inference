What is the probability that at least half of them are girls? (We can assume a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, and vice-versa.)\n\nA. \\frac{1}{2}\nB. \\frac{1}{4}\nC. \\frac{1}{8}\nD. \\frac{3}{5}\n\nassistant:To find the probability that at least half of John's children are girls, we can find the probability that the opposite occurs and subtract it from 1.\n\nIf half of John's children are girls, then the other half must be boys. The probability of having a girl or a boy is equal, so the probability of having a girl followed by a boy (or vice versa) is the same as the probability of having a boy followed by a girl.\n\nThe probability of having a girl is \\frac{1}{2} and the probability of having a boy is also \\frac{1}{2}.\n\nSo the probability of having a girl followed by a boy (or vice versa) is:\n\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\nThe probability of having at least half of John's children being girls is the complement of the probability of having at least half of his children being boys:\n\n1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\nNow we need to find the probability of having at least half of John's children being boys. We can do this by considering the complementary events of having at least two girls and at least two boys.\n\nThe probability of having at least two girls is:\n\nP(\\text{at least 2 girls}) = 1 - P(\\text{0 girls}) - P(\\text{1 girl})\nP(\\text{at least 2 girls}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least two boys is:\n\nP(\\text{at least 2 boys}) = 1 - P(\\text{0 boys}) - P(\\text{1 boy})\nP(\\text{at least 2 boys}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\nThe probability of having at least half of John's children being boys is the sum of the probabilities of having at least two boys and at least two girls:\n\nP(\\text{at least half boys}) = P(\\text{at least 2 boys}) + P(\\text{at least 2 girls})\nP(\\text{at least half boys}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\nNow we can find the probability of having at least half of John's children being girls by subtracting the probability of having at least half boys from 1:\n\nP(\\text{at least half girls}) = 1 - P(\\text{at least half boys})\nP(\\text{at least half girls}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\nP(\\text{at least half girls}) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\nSo the probability of having at least half of John's children being girls is \\frac{1}{2}, which corresponds to option A.",
