They intend to use a 95% confidence interval with margin of error of no more than 2.5%. What is the minimum sample size needed to accomplish this goal?\n\nA. 1536\nB. 39\nC. 1537\nD. 40\n\nassistant:To determine the minimum sample size needed, we can use the formula for calculating the margin of error for a proportion:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)\n\nwhere:\n- Margin of Error is the maximum difference between the predicted proportion and the true proportion\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence level, Z = 1.96)\n- p is the predicted proportion of voters supporting each candidate\n- n is the sample size\n\nWe don't have the exact predicted proportions for each candidate, so let's assume the proportions are equally distributed (50% for each candidate). In this case, the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5% is:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * sqrt(0.5 * 0.5 / n)\n\nWe want the Margin of Error to be no more than 2.5%, so:\n\n2.5% = 1.96 * sqrt(0.5 * 0.5 / n)\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = (2.5^2) / (1.96^2) * 0.5 * 0.5\nn \u2248 1536.32\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sample size, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum sample size needed is:\n\nA. 1536",
