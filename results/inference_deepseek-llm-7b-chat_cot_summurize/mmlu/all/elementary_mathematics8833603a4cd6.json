What is the total length of the music showcase?\n\nA. 73 minutes\nB. 110 minutes\nC. 130 minutes\nD. 210 minutes\n\nassistant:To calculate the total length of the music showcase, we need to add the durations of each set and the breaks between them.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n- 3 sets of 20 minutes each: 3 * 20 = 60 minutes\n- 1 set of 40 minutes: 40 minutes\n- 10-minute breaks between each set: 3 * 10 = 30 minutes\n\nNow, we add the durations together: 60 + 40 + 30 = 130 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total length of the music showcase is 130 minutes. The correct answer is C. 130 minutes.",
