The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. auditory tube opens - This refers to the eustachian tube, which is responsible for equalizing air pressure in the middle ear.\nB. cricopharyngeus muscle contracts - This is a muscle that helps to regulate the size of the stomach and esophagus, but it does not play a role in swallowing.\nC. rima glottis opens - This is the opening between the vocal folds in the larynx, which is involved in speech and not swallowing.",
