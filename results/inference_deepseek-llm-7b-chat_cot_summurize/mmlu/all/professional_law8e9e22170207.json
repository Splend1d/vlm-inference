This is because, in the United States, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution allows for a search incident to a lawful arrest if the arresting officer has probable cause to believe that the place to be searched contains the person to be arrested. In this case, the officers had probable cause to believe that the driver was in possession of drugs and an assault rifle, both of which were found in the trunk of the car. Therefore, the search of the trunk was considered incident to the lawful arrest of the driver.",
