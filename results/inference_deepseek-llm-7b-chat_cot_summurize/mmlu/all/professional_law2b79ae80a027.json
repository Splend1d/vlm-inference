Since no fundamental right is involved, the petitioner must show the age restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. In this case, the petitioner (the state senator) is challenging the constitutionality of a statute that prohibits anyone over 60 years of age from running for public office. The burden of persuasion lies with the petitioner to show that the age restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. This means that the petitioner must demonstrate that the age restriction is not justified by a legitimate state interest and that there is no direct relationship between the restriction and the achievement of that interest.",
