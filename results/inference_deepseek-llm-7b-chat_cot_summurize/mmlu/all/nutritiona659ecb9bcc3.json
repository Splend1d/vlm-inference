As income rises, the proportion of income spent on food, declines.\n\nEngel's law is a principle that states that as a country's or region's income increases, the proportion of the total expenditure allocated to food products tends to decrease. This law is named after the German economist, Max Engel, who first proposed it in 1908. It is based on the concept that as people's income increases, they tend to shift their spending from basic necessities to non-essential items, including higher-quality food products.",
