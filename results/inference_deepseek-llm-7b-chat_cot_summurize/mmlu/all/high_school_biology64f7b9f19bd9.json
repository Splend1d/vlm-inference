Which set of genotypes represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur from parents that both have brown fur?\n\nA. BB BB\nB. BB Bb\nC. Bb Bb\nD. Bb bb\n\nassistant:To determine the set of genotypes that could produce offspring with silver fur from parents that both have brown fur, we can use the concept of dominance in genetics.\n\nIn this case, the gene for brown fur (B) is dominant over the gene for silver fur (b). This means that the offspring will have brown fur (Bb) if at least one of the parents carries the brown fur gene (B).\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. BB BB - Both parents have brown fur (BbBb), so their offspring could have either brown fur (Bb) or silver fur (bb).\n\nB. BB Bb - Both parents have brown fur (BbBb), so their offspring could have either brown fur (Bb) or silver fur (bb).\n\nC. Bb Bb - Both parents have brown fur (BbBb), so their offspring could have either brown fur (Bb) or silver fur (bb).\n\nD. Bb bb - One parent has brown fur (Bb) and the other parent has silver fur (bb). This combination cannot produce offspring with silver fur, as the silver fur gene (b) is not dominant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. BB Bb, as it is the only option where the offspring could have silver fur (bb) if at least one parent carries the silver fur gene (b).",
