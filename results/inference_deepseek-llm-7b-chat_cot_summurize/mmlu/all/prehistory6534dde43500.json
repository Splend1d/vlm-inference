They believed in a complex religious system that involved many gods and goddesses. In times of great difficulty or stress, it is believed that they would sacrifice humans, usually adults, but sometimes children, as a way to appease the gods and ensure their favor. This practice was believed to bring good fortune and to maintain the balance between the natural and supernatural worlds.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Burnt their own houses to the ground: The Minoans did not burn their own houses to the ground as a way to appease the gods. Instead, they built elaborate temples and palaces dedicated to their gods.\n\nC. Fasted for long periods: Fasting was not a common practice among the Minoans. They were known for their love of food and drink, and their cuisine was considered to be one of the most advanced in the ancient world.\n\nD. Abstained from sexual relations: The Minoans were known for their sexual practices and artistic depictions of human sexuality. They did not abstain from sexual relations as a way to appease the gods. Instead, they celebrated their sexuality and believed that it was an important aspect of their lives.",
