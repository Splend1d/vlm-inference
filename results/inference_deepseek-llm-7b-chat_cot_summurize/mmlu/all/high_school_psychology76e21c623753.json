Therefore, the neutral stimulus that signals the unconditioned stimulus begins to produce a response that anticipates and prepares for the unconditioned stimulus during spontaneous recovery.\n\nAcquisition trials, generalization, and extinction trials are all related to the process of conditioning, but they do not involve the neutral stimulus signaling the unconditioned stimulus and preparing for it. Acquisition trials are when the conditioned response is first learned, generalization is when the conditioned response is applied to similar stimuli, and extinction trials are when the conditioned response is no longer elicited by the conditioned stimulus.",
