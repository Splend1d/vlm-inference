Latitude is a measure of how far north or south a location is from the equator, which is 0 degrees latitude. The other options are not related to latitude. The global grid system is a way of dividing the Earth into equal-sized sections, and the Prime Meridian is a line of 0 degrees longitude that passes through the International Date Line. Longitude is a measure of how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian, which is 0 degrees longitude.",
