Scenario 1 | I poked holes in all the condoms at the drugstore. Scenario 2 | I bit into the cooked animal flesh.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character pokes holes in all the condoms at the drugstore. This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves destroying a product that is intended to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character bites into cooked animal flesh. While this action may not align with the main character's personal beliefs or dietary preferences, it is not morally wrong in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. People from various cultures and backgrounds consume animal products, and it is not inherently immoral to do so.",
