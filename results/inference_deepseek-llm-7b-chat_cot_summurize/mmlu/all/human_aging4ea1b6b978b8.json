Hormones\nB. Risky behaviors and occupations\nC. Proportion who smoke\nD. All of the above\n\nassistant:The gender gap is likely to be associated with male/female differences in all of the above. There are several factors that contribute to the gender gap, including hormones, risky behaviors and occupations, and differences in smoking rates. For example, women tend to have higher levels of estrogen than men, which can affect their risk for certain health conditions. Additionally, women are more likely to engage in certain risky behaviors, such as smoking and substance abuse, than men. Finally, women are also more likely to hold lower-paying jobs and are more likely to be the primary caregivers for their children, which can limit their opportunities for education and career advancement. Overall, these factors contribute to the gender gap and highlight the need for continued efforts to promote gender equality.",
