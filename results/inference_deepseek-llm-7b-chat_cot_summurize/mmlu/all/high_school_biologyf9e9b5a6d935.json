This statement is not in line with the endosymbiotic theory, which proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living bacteria that were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, leading to the formation of endosymbiotic organelles. In contrast, modern bacteria do not have circular chromosomes without histones or proteins.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.",
