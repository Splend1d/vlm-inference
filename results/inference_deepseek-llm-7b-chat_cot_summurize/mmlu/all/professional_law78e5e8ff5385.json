This is because the statute only provides the subsidy to hospitals that do not perform abortions, which could potentially limit a woman's right to choose and access to abortion services. The other options are not as strong because they either do not directly relate to the constitutionality of the statute or do not directly impact the fundamental rights of individuals.",
