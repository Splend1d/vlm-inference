Which fundamental force of nature is responsible for this interaction, and why?\n\nA. The electric force, because the protons in the nuclei of the top atomic layer of the table repel the nuclei in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\nB.

The strong nuclear force, because the protons in the nuclei of the top atomic layer of the table repel the nuclei in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\n\nassistant:The fundamental force of nature responsible for this interaction is the gravitational force. The reason is that the gravitational force acts between any two objects with mass, and in this case, the table and the wooden block have mass. The gravitational force between them is what keeps the block in place on the table. The other options (electric force, electric force, and strong nuclear force) are not responsible for this interaction, as they only act between charged particles.",
