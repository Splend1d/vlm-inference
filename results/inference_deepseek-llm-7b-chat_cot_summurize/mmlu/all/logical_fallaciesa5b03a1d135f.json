This fallacy occurs when the fact that a certain behavior is commonly done is used as evidence that it is correct or justified. It is a form of argumentum ad populum, which is a logical fallacy that involves appealing to the majority or consensus of people. In this case, the fallacy is committed when a person relies on the fact that others do something as a basis for their own decision, without considering other factors or evidence.",
