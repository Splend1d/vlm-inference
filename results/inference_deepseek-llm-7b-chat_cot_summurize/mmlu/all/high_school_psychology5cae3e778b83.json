She has to be the seventh caller to win. While pulling over so that she can call in, she repeats the number to herself several times. Elise was using which of the following to remember the phone number?\n\nA. Iconic memory\nB. Elaborative rehearsal\nC. Chunking\nD. Maintenance rehearsal\n\nassistant:Elise was using maintenance rehearsal to remember the phone number. Maintenance rehearsal is a technique that involves repeating information to oneself in order to maintain it in memory. In this case, Elise was repeating the phone number (7-digits) to herself multiple times as she was pulling over to call in. This technique helps to keep the information fresh in her mind, allowing her to recall it more easily when needed.\n\nIconic memory refers to the memory of visual images, and is not directly related to remembering phone numbers. Elaborative rehearsal is a more advanced technique that involves elaborating on the information you want to remember, making connections and associations to make the information more memorable. Chunking is a memory technique that involves grouping related information together, but in this case, Elise was not grouping the numbers together, she was simply repeating them individually.",
