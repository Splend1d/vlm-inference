A and B\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Artificial selection. Cattle breeders have improved the quality of meat by selecting and breeding cattle with desirable traits, such as higher muscle mass and leanness. This process is known as artificial selection, which involves humans intentionally choosing which individuals to breed based on their genetic traits. Directional selection and stabilizing selection are processes that involve the natural selection of traits, but they are not directly responsible for improving meat quality in cattle.",
