When he entered his bedroom, the man saw his wife engaged in sexual intercourse with a neighbor. The man grabbed a gun from a dresser drawer and shot and killed the neighbor. He was later charged and prosecuted. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law for homicide offenses, which crimes should the court instruct the jury on?\n\nA. Murder and involuntary manslaughter.\nB. Murder and voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter.\nD. Voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.\n\nassistant:The court should instruct the jury on both murder and involuntary manslaughter in this jurisdiction that follows the common law for homicide offenses. The man became ill at work and decided to go home early, which indicates that he did not intend to cause harm to his neighbor. However, when he saw his wife engaged in sexual intercourse with the neighbor, he lost control of his emotions and acted impulsively. This action could be considered an involuntary manslaughter, which is a crime where the defendant's actions were not intended to cause harm, but the harm resulted from their actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the man could also be charged with murder if he intended to cause harm to the neighbor. In this case, the man's actions could be considered premeditated, and he may have planned to kill the neighbor. This would be a murder charge, which is a more serious crime than involuntary manslaughter.\n\nTherefore, the court should instruct the jury on both murder and involuntary manslaughter in this jurisdiction that follows the common law for homicide offenses. The correct answer is C. Murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter.",
