Progesterone challenge test\nB. Colposcopy\nC. Cystoscopy\nD. Endometrial biopsy\n\nassistant:The most appropriate next step in diagnosis for this patient would be a D&C with endometrial sampling. The patient's history of vaginal bleeding and the fact that her uterus is normal sized and the ovaries cannot be palpated suggest the possibility of endometrial cancer. The patient's family history of colon and breast cancer also increases the risk of endometrial cancer. A D&C with endometrial sampling would help to determine the cause of the patient's bleeding and rule out or confirm endometrial cancer.",
