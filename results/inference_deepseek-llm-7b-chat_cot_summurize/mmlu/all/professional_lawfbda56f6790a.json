This is because it changes the terms of the agreement, which was to use at least $2 from each admission charge for the first five years and then $1 from each admission charge for the next five years to repay the bond debt. With the new law, the racetrack will now have to use less money from each admission charge to repay the bond debt, which is a violation of the bond agreement.",
