Statement 2| Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:A. True, True\n\nVGG-Net and AlexNet are two popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have been widely used in computer vision tasks. VGG-Net was introduced in 2014 by Simonyan and Zisserman, while AlexNet was introduced in 2012 by Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton.\n\nStatement 1 is true. VGG-Net has convolutional kernels of smaller width and height than AlexNet's first-layer kernels. VGG-Net uses 3x3 filters, while AlexNet uses 7x7 filters in its first layer.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization. The idea of data-dependent initialization was proposed by Xavier and Bengio in 2009, while Batch Normalization was proposed by Ioffe and Szegedy in 2015.",
