It was established in 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, with the aim of promoting peace and security by providing an impartial forum for the settlement of disputes between States. One of the main functions of the ICJ is to provide advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs, such as the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as specialized agencies and other organs of the United Nations that may be so authorized by the General Assembly.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Only the principal organs of the UN may request an advisory opinion - This option is partially correct. The correct answer mentions that other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies may also request advisory opinions.\n\nB. All international organizations may request an advisory opinion - This option is incorrect. Only authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies may request advisory opinions.\n\nD. The principal organs of the UN may request an advisory opinion as well as the State that have been authorized by the General Assembly - This option is unclear and does not accurately describe the authority to request an advisory opinion from the ICJ.",
