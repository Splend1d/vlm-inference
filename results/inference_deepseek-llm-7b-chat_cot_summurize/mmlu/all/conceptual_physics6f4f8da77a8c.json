All of these\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. refraction.\n\nA rainbow is formed when sunlight enters water droplets in the atmosphere and is refracted. The light then undergoes a total internal reflection, which causes it to be refracted again and appear as a rainbow. Dispersion is also involved, as the light is separated into its individual colors, but refraction is the primary cause of the rainbow.",
