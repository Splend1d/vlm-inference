Admit the instruction, because the law was passed before the prosecution was initiated.\nD. Admit the instruction, as a bill of attainder.\n\nassistant:D. Admit the instruction, as a bill of attainder.\n\nThe state's request for a jury instruction based on the statutory computer virus clarification is a bill of attainder. A bill of attainder is a legislative act that singles out a specific group or individual for punishment. In this case, the bill of attainder would punish Corry for actions that occurred before the law was passed. This would be a violation of the Constitution's prohibition on bills of attainder, which is designed to protect individuals from being singled out for punishment based on their actions.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Reject the instruction, based on ex post facto. This option is incorrect because the ex post facto clause prohibits punishment for actions that were legal at the time they were committed. In this case, the actions were illegal, so the ex post facto clause does not apply.\n\nB. Reject the instruction as a violation of due process. This option is incorrect because the due process clause of the Constitution protects individuals from being denied life, liberty, or property without due process of law. However, the bill of attainder in this case does not involve any of these issues.\n\nC. Admit the instruction, because the law was passed before the prosecution was initiated. This option is incorrect because the law was passed after Corry's actions took place. Therefore, it is not a violation of the Constitution to use the law in the prosecution of Corry.",
