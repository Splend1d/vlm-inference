K-1/K\nC. log_10 (1/N)\nD. N-1/m\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. K-1/K.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA complete K-ary tree of depth N has N nonterminal nodes and (K^N) total nodes. Therefore, the ratio of nonterminal nodes to total nodes is (N/K^N). Simplifying, we get (K-1)/K.\n\nSo, B. K-1/K is the best approximation of the ratio of the number of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N.",
