The cab driver had no intention of committing a crime, and the police officer deliberately set him up to commit a crime. Therefore, the cab driver should be found not guilty solely because he was entrapped.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the question does not involve a lack of guilt, but rather a lack of voluntariness in the cab driver's actions. Answer C is incorrect because the question does not mention an alibi defense. Answer D is incorrect because the question does not provide any information about the cab driver's predisposition to commit the crime.",
