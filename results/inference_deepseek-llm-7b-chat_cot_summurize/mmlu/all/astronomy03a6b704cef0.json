It is an imaginary circle in the sky that corresponds to the apparent path of the Sun across the sky as seen from Earth. The ecliptic is also known as the Sun's apparent path or the Sun's apparent path across the sky. It is an important concept in astrology, as it is used to determine the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets in the sky at any given time. The Sun's apparent path across the sky is also known as the solar ecliptic.",
