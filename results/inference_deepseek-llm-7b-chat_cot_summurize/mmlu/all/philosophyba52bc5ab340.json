The connection to the problem of the existence of God is that some philosophers argue that if God exists, then moral luck becomes less of a problem because God would ensure that everyone gets what they deserve, regardless of luck. This is in contrast to the idea that moral luck is a problem if there is no God or if God does not play a role in determining moral outcomes.",
