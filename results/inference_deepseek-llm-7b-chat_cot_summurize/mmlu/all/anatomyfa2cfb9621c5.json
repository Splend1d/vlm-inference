The roof\nB. The floor\nC. The lateral wall\nD. The medial wall\n\nassistant:The most likely orbital wall to collapse in a 'blow out' fracture is D. The medial wall. This type of fracture occurs when the medial wall of the orbit is subjected to high-energy trauma, such as a severe blow to the face. The medial wall is most vulnerable to this type of injury because it is the weakest point in the orbital complex. The roof and floor of the orbit are also prone to fractures, but they are usually caused by different types of trauma. The lateral wall of the orbit is generally not affected by 'blow out' fractures.",
