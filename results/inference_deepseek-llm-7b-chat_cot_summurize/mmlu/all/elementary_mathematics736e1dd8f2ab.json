What is the average temperature?\n\nA. 76\u00b0C\nB. \u221249\u00b0C\nC. 49\u00b0C\nD. \u221276\u00b0C\n\nassistant:To find the average temperature, we need to calculate the sum of the temperatures and divide by the number of hours in a day. Since Mars has 24 hours, we can assume that the temperature is constant throughout the day.\n\nSum of temperatures = (27\u00b0C + \u2212125\u00b0C) = \u221298\u00b0C\n\nNumber of hours = 24\n\nAverage temperature = Sum of temperatures / Number of hours = \u221298\u00b0C / 24 = \u22124.083\u00b0C\n\nSince the temperature cannot be negative, we can assume that the average temperature is \u22124.083\u00b0C. However, this is not an option in the list. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer.",
