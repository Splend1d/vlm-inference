A member of Congress inserts a provision into a bill to secure funding for a project in his or her district.\n\n\"Pork barrel\" legislation refers to the practice of allocating funds for specific projects or programs in a way that benefits a particular district or constituency, often at the expense of other districts or constituencies. Option D describes this practice, as a member of Congress inserts a provision into a bill to secure funding for a project in their district.\n\nOption A is about a federal agency, not legislation. Option B is about the passage of a bill, not about pork barrel legislation. Option C is about a senator's stance on taxes, not about pork barrel legislation.",
