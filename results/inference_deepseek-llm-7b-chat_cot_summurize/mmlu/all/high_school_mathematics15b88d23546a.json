He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nA. \\frac{1}{6}\nB. \\frac{1}{64}\nC. \\frac{1}{32}\nD. \\frac{1}{2}\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations. We have 5 statements, and we want to find the probability of the correct sequence of answers TFTFT.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible sequences of answers. Since each statement can be either true or false, we have 2 choices for each of the 5 statements. Therefore, the total number of possible sequences is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's find the number of sequences that match the correct sequence TFTFT. Since each statement can be either true or false, there are 2 possible sequences for each of the 5 statements. Therefore, the number of sequences that match the correct sequence is 2^5 = 32.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of correct sequences by the total number of possible sequences:\n\nProbability = Number of correct sequences / Total number of possible sequences\nProbability = 32 / 32\nProbability = 1\n\nThe correct answer is D. \\frac{1}{2}.",
