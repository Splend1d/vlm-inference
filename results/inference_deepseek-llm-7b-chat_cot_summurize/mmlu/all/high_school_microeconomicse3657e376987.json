This is because as demand for a good increases, the price of that good will also increase. If the price of the good increases, the marginal revenue product of labor will also increase, and the supply of labor will increase. This will cause the labor market equilibrium to shift to the right, and the labor market demand curve to shift to the left.\n\nA. an increase in the price of the good which the labor is producing is incorrect because it is the demand for the good that increases, not the price.\n\nC. an increase in the wage rate paid to workers is also incorrect because it is the demand for the good that increases, not the wage rate.\n\nD. a decrease in the marginal product of labor is also incorrect because it is the demand for the good that increases, not the marginal product of labor.",
