The abolition of slavery in the United States was certain to come about because slavery was immoral.\n\nassistant:The principle described in the passage is about the \"great nation of futurity\" that will manifest in the boundless future, and will establish the noblest temple on earth, a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions. This nation will be governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood, and will promote peace and good will amongst men.\n\nOption A is not relevant to the principle described in the passage.\nOption B is about women's roles, not America's greatness or destiny.\nOption C is about America's expansion to the West Coast, not the principles described in the passage.\n\nOption D is the closest to the principle described in the passage. It states that the abolition of slavery in the United States was certain to come about because slavery was immoral. This aligns with the idea of a nation governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, and promoting peace and good will amongst men.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.
