For each subsequent stone, Alex walks two feet farther each way. Alex will place the first 50 stones in a path. After returning to the crate from placing the $50^\\text{th}$ stone, what is the total distance Alex walked, in feet?\n\nA. 100\nB. 90950\nC. 5200\nD. 50\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Alex walked for the first 50 stones.\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n- For the first stone, Alex walks 3 feet.\n- For the second stone, Alex walks 3 + 2 = 5 feet.\n- For the third stone, Alex walks 5 + 2 = 7 feet.\n- For the fourth stone, Alex walks 7 + 2 = 9 feet.\n- For the fifth stone, Alex walks 9 + 2 = 11 feet.\n- ...\n- For the 50th stone, Alex walks 108 + 2 = 110 feet.\n\nNow, let's sum up the distances for the first 50 stones:\n3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + ... + 110 = 3(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 108)\n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nIn our case, n = 50, a1 = 3, and an = 110.\nSum = (50 * (3 + 110)) / 2\nSum = (50 * 113) / 2\nSum = 5650 / 2\nSum = 2825\n\nSo, Alex walked a total of 2825 feet for the first 50 stones.\nThe answer is: 50",
