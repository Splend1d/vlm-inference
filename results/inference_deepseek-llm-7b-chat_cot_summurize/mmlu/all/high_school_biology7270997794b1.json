Which of the following characteristics would be expected for leaves of this plant?\n\nA. stomata on the top surface and relatively few water-conducting (xylem) cells\nB. stomata on the top surface and relatively many water-conducting (xylem) cells\nC. stomata on the bottom surface and relatively few water-conducting (xylem) cells\nD. stomata on the bottom surface and relatively many water-conducting (xylem) cells\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. stomata on the top surface and relatively few water-conducting (xylem) cells.\n\nWater lilies like Nymphaea odorata have floating leaves that need to stay buoyant on the water surface. This requires their leaves to have a low density, and the best way to achieve this is to have fewer water-conducting (xylem) cells in the leaves. Xylem cells are responsible for transporting water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. If there are fewer xylem cells in the leaves, the leaves will be less dense, and they will float on the surface of the water.\n\nStomata, which are tiny pores on the surface of leaves, play a role in gas exchange. They allow carbon dioxide to enter the leaf and oxygen to escape. In this case, stomata on the top surface of the leaf will allow carbon dioxide to be absorbed from the water and air, while oxygen will be released back into the water.\n\nB is incorrect because water lilies need to have fewer water-conducting (xylem) cells in their leaves to stay buoyant.\nC is incorrect because water lilies have stomata on the top surface of their leaves, not the bottom surface.\nD is incorrect because having more water-conducting (xylem) cells in the leaves of a water lily would make the leaves denser, making them sink to the bottom of the water, which is not what water lilies want.",
