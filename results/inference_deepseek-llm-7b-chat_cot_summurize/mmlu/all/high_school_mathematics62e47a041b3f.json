You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A person walked 3 miles to the east, then turned north and walked 10 miles, then turned west and walked 6 miles, and finally turned south and walked 16 miles. Approximately how far is the person from his starting point in miles?\n\nA. 3.4\nB. 6.7\nC. 9.2\nD. 12.8\n\nassistant:To find the approximate distance from the starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The person's path forms a right-angled triangle, with the starting point at one corner, and the eastern, northern, western, and southern points as the other corners.\n\nLet x be the distance from the starting point to the eastern point, y be the distance from the starting point to the northern point, z be the distance from the starting point to the western point, and w be the distance from the starting point to the southern point.\n\nx^2 + y^2 = z^2 + w^2\n\nWe know the values of x, y, z, and w:\n\nx = 3 miles\ny = 10 miles\nz = 6 miles\nw = 16 miles\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n3^2 + 10^2 = 6^2 + w^2\n9 + 100 = 36 + w^2\n109 = 36 + w^2\n\nNow, we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\n109 - 36 = 36 + w^2 - 36\n73 = w^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides:\n\n\u221a73 = \u221a(w^2)\nw = \u221a73\n\nSo, the person is approximately 73 miles away from the starting point.
