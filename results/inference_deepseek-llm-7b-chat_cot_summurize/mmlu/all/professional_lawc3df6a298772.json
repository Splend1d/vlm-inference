Thereafter, a man was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification by the witness.\nB. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.\n\nassistant:The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged C. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nAccording to the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay is a statement that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The statement is made out of court by a person who is not available as a witness in the court and is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the owner's testimony is not admissible because it is a statement made out of court by a person who is not available as a witness in the court, and it is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted that picture #4 is a picture of the person who robbed his store.\n\nFurthermore, even if the testimony was admissible, the prosecutor's actions of handing the owner six photographs would likely be considered prejudicial and could result in the admission of the testimony being barred under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 403 provides that \"the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by a danger of confusion of the issues or by a risk of undue prejudice, delay, or unnecessary waste of time.\" In this case, the admission of the testimony could be considered prejudicial as it may cause confusion of the issues or create an undue prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, the owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged inadmissible as it is hearsay not within any recognized exception and because the prosecutor's actions of handing the owner six photographs would likely be considered prejudicial and could result in the admission of the testimony being barred under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.",
