Hubble Space Telescope images that resolved Pluto's disk\nC. brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon\nD. radar observations made by the Arecibo telescope\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. a New Horizons flyby in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto, providing the first-ever close-up measurements of its size, shape, and geology. These measurements allowed scientists to determine that Pluto has a diameter of about 2,373 kilometers (1,476 miles).\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Hubble Space Telescope did not resolve Pluto's disk until the 2000s, long after the New Horizons flyby. Option C is incorrect because brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon would only provide information about their relative brightness and not about Pluto's diameter. Option D is incorrect because the Arecibo telescope is a radio telescope and was not used to observe Pluto.",
