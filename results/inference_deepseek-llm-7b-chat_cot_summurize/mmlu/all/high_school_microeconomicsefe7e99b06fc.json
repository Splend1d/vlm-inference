The marginal cost curve intersects the demand curve.\n\nIn a natural monopoly, the cost of producing an additional unit of output tends to decline as the level of production increases. This is because the fixed costs of production are spread over a larger number of units, leading to a decline in the marginal cost of producing each additional unit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would mean that the government is selecting the price at which average revenue is zero, which is not necessarily the socially optimal price.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it would mean that the government is selecting the price at which marginal revenue is zero, which is not necessarily the socially optimal price.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it would mean that the government is selecting the price at which average total cost is zero, which is not necessarily the socially optimal price.",
