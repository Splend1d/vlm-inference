Water entering the plant through the roots provides hydrogen directly to the Calvin cycle.\nD. CO2 released by the light-dependent reactions provides the raw material for the Calvin cycle.\n\nassistant:The light reactions of photosynthesis supply the Calvin cycle with ATP and NADPH. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a energy-rich molecule that the Calvin cycle uses to perform its chemical reactions, while NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) donates electrons that are needed for carbon fixation.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. The light reactions do not provide oxygen for the light-independent reactions. Oxygen is produced during the light-dependent reactions, but it is not used by the Calvin cycle.\n\nC. Water entering the plant through the roots does not provide hydrogen directly to the Calvin cycle. Water is used in the light reactions to drive the chemical reactions, but it is not directly involved in the Calvin cycle.\n\nD. CO2 released by the light-dependent reactions does not provide the raw material for the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle uses CO2 that is fixed by RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) during the Calvin cycle.",
