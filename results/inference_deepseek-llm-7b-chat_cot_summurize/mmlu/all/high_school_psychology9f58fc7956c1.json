They are typically administered to large groups of people and are often used for purposes such as placement in schools or colleges, job placement, or licensing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because standardized tests are not necessarily given by a person's state or country. They can be given by schools, colleges, or other organizations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while standardized tests do have a set of directions, this is not the defining characteristic of a standardized test.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while standardized tests can be compared with a pilot group, this is not the defining characteristic of a standardized test. The key characteristic of a standardized test is that it is designed and administered in a consistent and fair manner.",
