The text describes Xuanzang as a monk who had no interest in honor and glory, and who was chosen to go on a journey to fetch scriptures. It also introduces the concept of a \"divine Monkey King\" and mentions a prayer in which Xuanzang asks to be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King. These elements complicate the historical understanding of Xuanzang's life, as they are not consistent with the known facts about his life and accomplishments.",
