So the inequality becomes $n < n-3$. This is not true for any values of $n$.\n\nCase 2: $n < 3$\nIn this case, $|n| = -(n)$, and $|n-3| = -(n-3)$. So the inequality becomes $-(n) < -(n-3)$. Simplifying, we get $3 < n-3$. The only value of $n$ that satisfies this inequality is $n = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for $|n| < |n-3|$ are $n = 3$.\n\nNow, we can look at the second inequality $|n-3| < 9$. Since $n = 3$ is a solution, we can substitute it into the inequality: $3-3 < 9$. This is true, and there are no other solutions for $|n-3|$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer solutions to $|n| < |n-3| < 9$ is $3 + 3 = 6$. However, there is no option for 6 in the given choices. This could be a mistake in the problem statement or a misunderstanding on the part of the user.",
