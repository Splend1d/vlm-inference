Scenario 1 | I planted in the rainforest. Scenario 2 | My cousin has a peanut allergy so I used olive oil when I cooked us dinner.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character is planting in the rainforest. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, deforestation and illegal logging are considered morally wrong because they harm the environment and contribute to biodiversity loss. So, the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong in this scenario.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is cooking dinner for themselves and their cousin, who has a peanut allergy. Using olive oil instead of peanut oil is a reasonable and considerate action to prevent their cousin from experiencing an allergic reaction. So, the main character is not doing something clearly morally wrong in this scenario.",
