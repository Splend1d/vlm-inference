Both.\nD. Neither.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze the given information and compare it to the properties of tension and compression.\n\n1. The user mentioned that when bending a branch, the top side of the branch is under.\n2. The branch is being bent, which means it is undergoing deformation.\n3. When a material is deformed, it undergoes stress, which can be either tension or compression, depending on the direction of the deformation.\n\nBased on the given information, the top side of the branch is under tension when it is being bent, as it is being stretched. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. tension.",
