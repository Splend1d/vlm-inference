This illustrates generalization.\n\nGeneralization is a concept in learning and psychology that refers to the ability to apply knowledge or skills learned in one situation to new, similar situations. In this case, the pigeon has learned to peck at a green light, but when presented with a yellow light, it peck at it as well, even though it's not the correct color for the task. This demonstrates the pigeon's ability to generalize its learned behavior to a new, similar situation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. generalization.",
