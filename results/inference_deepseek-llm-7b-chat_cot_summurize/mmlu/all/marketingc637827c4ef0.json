In this case, the company is building its sales message, advertising message, and promotion theme to influence how a particular market sector perceives a good or service in comparison with the competition, which is a key aspect of the positioning process.\n\nSegmentation is the process of dividing a market into smaller groups of consumers with similar needs, preferences, or behaviors. Mass customization is the process of creating products that are tailored to individual customers' specific needs and preferences. Concentrated targeting is the process of focusing marketing efforts on a specific segment of the market. While these are all important aspects of marketing, they are not the primary focus of the company in this scenario.",
