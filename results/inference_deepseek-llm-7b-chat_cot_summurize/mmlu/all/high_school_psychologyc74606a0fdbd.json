This suggests that the researcher's positive attitude can influence the test participant's memory of the words, making them more likely to remember the words if the researcher has a positive attitude.\n\nThe other options do not have a strong correlation with the test participant's ability to recall the words from the list. B. being in a positive mood when initially exposed to the words may have a small impact on memory, but it is not as significant as having a positive attitude from the researcher. C. considering himself a \"positive\" person, regardless of his mood during the experience, does not necessarily affect the test participant's memory of the words. D. considering the initial testing experience positive, does not necessarily affect the test participant's memory of the words, as it does not specifically mention the researcher's attitude.",
