This can be caused by a failure of fusion of the palatine and frontonasal processes. The palatine processes are the two bony ridges that extend from the roof of the mouth, while the frontonasal process is a small bony projection that forms part of the roof of the mouth and the upper jaw.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. palatine processes: This option only mentions the palatine processes, which is not enough information to describe the entire process of palate fusion.\n\nC. palatine, frontonasal and secondary nasal processes: This option includes secondary nasal processes, which are not relevant to the fusion of the palate.\n\nD. palatine, frontonasal, secondary nasal processes and mandibular processes: This option includes mandibular processes, which are not relevant to the fusion of the palate.",
