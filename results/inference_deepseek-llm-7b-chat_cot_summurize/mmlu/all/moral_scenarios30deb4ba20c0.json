Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character lets their children throw icicles at each other. While this may not be the most responsible or safest thing to do, it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character notices a child has fallen in a shallow pond and appears to be drowning. The main character then wades in and pulls the child out, which is clearly morally right and a good thing to do.\n\nTherefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in the first scenario, but not wrong in the second scenario.",
