Socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States.\n\nassistant:The user has provided a passage from a radio address by Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, who proposed the \"Share Our Wealth Society\" in 1934. The society's motto was \"Every Man a King,\" and its goal was to limit the wealth of the wealthy and provide a guaranteed minimum wealth for every family. The passage mentions that the society does not propose to divide wealth equally, but rather to limit poverty and provide a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000. It also mentions that fortunes will be limited, with no man allowed to own more than $50,000,000.\n\nThe user is asking for the reason why Senator Long's \"Share the Wealth Society\" attracted many followers in 1934.\n\nTo answer this question, we can analyze the passage and look for the context in which the society was proposed. The passage mentions that the society was proposed during the Great Depression, which was a time of economic hardship and poverty for many people. This context suggests that the society's goal of limiting poverty and providing a guaranteed minimum wealth for every family would have resonated with people who were struggling during the Depression.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer to the user's question is:\n\nA. the New Deal had not ended the Great Depression.\n\nThis answer is supported by the passage, which mentions that the society was proposed during the Great Depression and that Senator Long was addressing the issue of poverty. The other options B, C, and D do not provide a clear reason for the popularity of the society in 1934.",
