The pattern rule is to add 14 to get the next number in the pattern. If the pattern continues, which statement is true?\n\nA. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 10.\nB. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 4.\nC. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 8.\nD. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7.\n\nassistant:B. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 4.\n\nThe pattern rule is to add 14 to get the next number in the pattern. So the next number would be 28 + 14 = 42. Then, the next number would be 42 + 14 = 56. And so on. We can see that each number in the pattern is 4 times the previous number. Therefore, all the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 4.",
