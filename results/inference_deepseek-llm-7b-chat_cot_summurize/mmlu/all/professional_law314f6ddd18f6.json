The extraction of other minerals is not taxed by the state. This is true even though there is considerable mining of silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone within the state. As a result, the largest platinum mining company in the state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?\n\nA. The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\nB. The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\nC. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest.\nD. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This means that a state law that discriminates against certain people or groups based on their membership in a certain class is unconstitutional.\n\nIn this case, the mining company is challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute, which imposes a tax on the extraction of all platinum in the state while not taxing the extraction of other minerals. The company argues that this classification is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n\nTo prove this, the mining company must show that the state has not shown a rational relationship between the classification and the advancement of a legitimate state interest. This means that the state must demonstrate a compelling reason for the classification and that the classification is the least restrictive means by which to advance that reason.\n\nIf the mining company can show that the state has not met this burden of persuasion, then the court may strike down the statute as unconstitutional.",
