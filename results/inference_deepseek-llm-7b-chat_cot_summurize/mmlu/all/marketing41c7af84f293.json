Non-durable goods are those that are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk. These goods typically have a short lifespan and are not meant to last for an extended period. Examples of non-durable goods include clothing, appliances, and electronics.\n\nLuxury goods, on the other hand, are typically high-priced items that are purchased for their status and exclusivity. These goods are often not bought infrequently and do not involve a high level of consumer risk. Durable goods, such as furniture and vehicles, are designed to last for an extended period and are not bought infrequently. Impulse goods are items that are bought on a whim or without much consideration, and they do not fit the description provided by the user.",
