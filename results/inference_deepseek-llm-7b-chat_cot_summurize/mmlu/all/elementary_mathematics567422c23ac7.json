He put 19 black pens and 12 red pens in each bag. Which expression shows the total number of pens Mr. Lucci put into bags?\n\nA. (5 \u00d7 19) + 12\nB. 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12)\nC. 5 + (19 \u00d7 12)\nD. (5 + 19) \u00d7 12\n\nassistant:To find the total number of pens Mr. Lucci put into bags, we can multiply the number of pens in each bag by the number of bags, and then add the two quantities.\n\nThe number of black pens in each bag is 19, and he put 5 bags together, so the total number of black pens is 19 \u00d7 5 = 95.\n\nSimilarly, the number of red pens in each bag is 12, and he also put 5 bags together, so the total number of red pens is 12 \u00d7 5 = 60.\n\nNow we can find the total number of pens by adding the number of black pens and red pens: 95 + 60 = 155.\n\nSo, the expression that shows the total number of pens is:\n\nA.
