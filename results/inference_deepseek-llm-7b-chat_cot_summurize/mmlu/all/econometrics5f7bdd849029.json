The test of significance and confidence interval approaches will always give the same conclusions.\n\nWhile both the test of significance and confidence interval approaches are used in hypothesis testing, they do not necessarily give the same conclusions. The test of significance is used to determine if the observed data is significantly different from the null hypothesis, while the confidence interval is used to estimate the population parameter and determine the level of confidence in the estimate.",
