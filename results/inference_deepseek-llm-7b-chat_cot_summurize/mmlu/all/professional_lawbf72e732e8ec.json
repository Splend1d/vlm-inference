The plaintiff calls a woman to testify. The woman proposes to testify that a witness who is now deceased told the woman that when he was walking past the convenience store one week before the plaintiff was hit by the branch, the witness saw an employee of the convenience store shoveling snow from the sidewalk in front of the store. The woman's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the witness is unavailable to testify.\nB. admissible, as relevant for the limited purpose of proving that the convenience store owner retained control over the sidewalk where the accident occurred.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nassistant:The woman's testimony is admissible under option B. The Dead Man's Statute (also known as the Statute of Disposition) typically applies when a witness has died before the trial begins. However, in this case, the woman is testifying about what the deceased witness told her, which is not hearsay because it is a statement made for a present purpose and not offered for its truth. Since the woman is not testifying about what the witness said, but what the witness told her, her testimony is admissible.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the woman's testimony would likely be limited to the scope of proving that the convenience store owner retained control over the sidewalk where the accident occurred. If the woman's testimony is sought to be used for any other purpose, it may not be admissible.\n\nIn conclusion, the woman's testimony is admissible under option B, but it would be subject to the limitations and relevance of the specific case.",
