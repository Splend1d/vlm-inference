There is an allosteric relationship between the concentrations of O2 and CO2. Hemoglobin's affinity for O2\n\nA. decreases as blood pH decreases\nB. increases as H+ concentration increases\nC. increases in exercising muscle tissue\nD. decreases as CO2 concentration decreases\n\nassistant:A. decreases as blood pH decreases\n\nHemoglobin's affinity for oxygen (O2) decreases as blood pH decreases. This is because the acidity of the blood (decreased pH) causes the hemoglobin molecule to become more negatively charged, which makes it less able to bind to O2. This is important for maintaining proper oxygen transport in the blood.\n\nThe other options are not accurate:\n\nB. increases as H+ concentration increases: This is not correct. As blood pH decreases, the hemoglobin's affinity for O2 decreases, not increases.\n\nC. increases in exercising muscle tissue: This is not directly related to the affinity of hemoglobin for O2. Exercise can affect blood pH, but the relationship between exercise and hemoglobin's affinity for O2 is complex and not directly proportional.\n\nD. decreases as CO2 concentration decreases: This is not correct. The affinity of hemoglobin for CO2 actually decreases as CO2 concentration decreases. This is because the binding of CO2 to hemoglobin is a competitive process with O2 binding, and the lower the CO2 concentration, the less competition there is for O2 binding.",
