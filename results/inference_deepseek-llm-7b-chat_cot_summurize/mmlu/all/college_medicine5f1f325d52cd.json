As the distance of the race increases, the muscle glycogen stores of the athlete will gradually be depleted, leading to a decline in the maximum sustainable power output. This is because muscle glycogen serves as the primary fuel source for the muscles during high-intensity exercise, and when its stores are depleted, the athlete's power output will decrease.\n\nWhile a high-fat diet may improve the athlete's endurance and overall performance, it does not directly impact the maximum sustainable power output. Similarly, the constant nature of the maximum sustainable power during a race does not hold true, as it can vary depending on factors such as the intensity of the race, the athlete's fitness level, and their overall energy stores. Lastly, the improvement in maximum sustainable power by a high-fat diet is not directly related to muscle glycogen content.",
