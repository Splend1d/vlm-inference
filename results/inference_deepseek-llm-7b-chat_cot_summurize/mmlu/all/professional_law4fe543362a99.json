Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal?\n\nA. No, because the arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics and is a proper concern of the criminal law.\nB. No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does.\nC. Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nD. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n",

Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics, but it is not clear that this would prevent a reversal of the conviction.\nB. The state's power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders does not necessarily mean that a conviction for drug addiction would not be overturned on appeal.\nC. While the statute does make it criminal to use illegal drugs, the question of whether this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is a separate issue that should be considered on appeal.",
