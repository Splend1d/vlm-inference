Suppress all speech but that of monarchs and the churches that they approve of.\n\nassistant:The passage describes a governmental regulation that requires the prior knowledge and approval of state officials for any daily issue or serial publication exceeding twenty sheets of printed matter. This regulation applies to writings that do not fall into the above-mentioned classes and is subject to the laws currently in force or those enacted in individual states. The passage also mentions that each state of the union is responsible not only to the state against which the offense is directly committed but also to the whole Confederation for every publication appearing under its supervision in which the honor or security of other states is infringed or their constitution or administration attacked.\n\nThe Carlsbad Resolutions were adopted by the Germanic States in 1819 and were another of Metternich's schemes, similar to the Concert of Europe. The purpose of the resolutions was to maintain control over European states by limiting the influence of democracy in the tradition of the Enlightenment. The resolutions aimed to suppress voices in government other than those of Metternich and control all aspects of citizens' lives. They also aimed to suppress all nationalist revolutions across the continent by imposing strict regulations on publication and speech.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Suppress all speech but that of monarchs and the churches that they approve of.",
