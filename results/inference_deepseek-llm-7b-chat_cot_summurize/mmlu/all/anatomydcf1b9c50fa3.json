Bell's palsy\nB. Crohn's disease\nC. Pernicious anemia\nD. Graves' disease\n\nassistant:Vitamin B-12 is primarily used to treat pernicious anemia, which is a type of anemia caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, a protein that is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B-12 in the stomach. The injections of vitamin B-12 help to replace the vitamin B-12 that is missing from the body, and can help to alleviate symptoms of anemia such as fatigue, weakness, and pale skin. Pernicious anemia is not the only disease that can benefit from vitamin B-12 injections, but it is the most common one for which it is used.",
