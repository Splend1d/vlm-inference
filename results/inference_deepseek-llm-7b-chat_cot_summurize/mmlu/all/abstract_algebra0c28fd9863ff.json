Statement 2 | Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Let G be a group of order 42. We know that the order of G is 42 = 3*7, where 3 and 7 are prime numbers. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 7.\n\nStatement 1: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.\nTo prove this statement, we need to show that there exists a subgroup of G of order 7 that is normal in G. Let H be a subgroup of G with order 7. Then, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of the normalizer N_G(H) must divide the order of H. Since the order of H is 7, the order of N_G(H) must be 7 as well. Thus, N_G(H) is a subgroup of G, and it must be equal to H. Therefore, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\nIn this case, we need to find a subgroup of G of order 8 that is normal in G. Since the order of G is 42, and the prime factorization is 3 * 7, we know that there are subgroups of order 3 and 7. However, we cannot directly conclude that there is a subgroup of order 8.\n\nTherefore, the first statement is true, and the second statement is false. The correct answer is C. True, False.",
