Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that affects the production of dopamine, leading to symptoms such as tremors, muscle stiffness, and difficulty with movement. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects the way a person thinks, feels, and behaves, and is also linked to reduced dopamine levels in the brain. While dopamine is not the only neurotransmitter implicated in these conditions, it is a key player in both Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.",
