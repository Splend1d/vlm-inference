The will states that Desmond and Deirdre take Desertacre \"subject to Cutler's mortgage.\" This means that they are taking the property with the mortgage already in place. As a devisee, Desmond is bound by the terms of the will, which includes being liable for the mortgage. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Liable for the mortgage.",
