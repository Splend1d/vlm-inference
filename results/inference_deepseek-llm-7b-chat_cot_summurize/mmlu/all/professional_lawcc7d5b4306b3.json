During the daughter's lifetime, the aunt's interest may best be described as a\n\nA. contingent remainder.\nB. shifting executory interest.\nC. vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.\nD. vested remainder subject to partial divestiture.\n\nassistant:The user provided a description of a deed in which a homeowner conveyed his home and surrounding property to his daughter for life, then to his aunt for life, but with conditions. If the aunt moves to another state, the property would go to the homeowner's sister for the length of the aunt's remaining life, and then to the aunt's heirs if she does not move, or to the sister's heirs if she does.\n\nBased on this information, the aunt's interest in the property can best be described as a contingent remainder. This is because the aunt's interest is contingent upon her remaining in the same state as the property, or her not moving to another state. If these conditions are not met, the property reverts to other beneficiaries, as described in the deed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. contingent remainder.",
