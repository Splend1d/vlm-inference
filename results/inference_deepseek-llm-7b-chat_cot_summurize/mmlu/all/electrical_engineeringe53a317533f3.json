LC network.\n\nPoles and zeros arranged alternatively on the negative real axis indicate a series LC circuit, which is an LC network. The LC network is a type of passive electronic filter that consists of a capacitor (C) and a coil (L) connected in series or parallel. The circuit's behavior is determined by the values of the components, and it can either pass or block signals based on the frequency of the input signal. In this case, the negative real axis indicates that the poles and zeros are arranged in the form of an LC circuit, which is also known as a low-pass filter.",
