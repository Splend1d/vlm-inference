A royal colony in which the King appointed the governor\nD. An independent colony governed outside the authority of the King\n\nassistant:The colony of Pennsylvania can be described as a proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family. In the Charter of Privileges granted by William Penn, Esq. to the Inhabitants of Pennsylvania and Territories, on October 28, 1701, William Penn granted and declared that no person or persons inhabiting in this province or territories would be molested or prejudiced in their person or estate because of their conscientious persuasion or practice. This demonstrates that the King entrusted government to William Penn, who was responsible for governing the colony and protecting the religious freedom of its inhabitants.\n\nA charter colony is a colony where the King grants a charter to a group of businessmen or colonists, but this does not accurately describe Pennsylvania. A royal colony is a colony where the King appoints the governor, but this is not the case for Pennsylvania either. An independent colony governed outside the authority of the King is not applicable to Pennsylvania, as it was a proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family.",
