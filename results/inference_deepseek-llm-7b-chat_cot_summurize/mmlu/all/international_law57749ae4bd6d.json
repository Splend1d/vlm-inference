An act is jure imperii when undertaken by an international organisation\nB. An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity\nC. All acts undertaken by State officials are acts jure imperii\nD. An act is jure imperii when undertaken by a State corporation\n\nassistant:An act jure imperii refers to a legal act carried out by a State or an international organization, which is based on its sovereign power and authority. This concept is used in international law to determine the legal status of actions taken by a State or an international organization that are considered to be acts of a sovereign State, even if they are not carried out by a State official.\n\nThe correct answer is B: An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity. This means that the act must be carried out by a State official, such as a government official or a representative of a State institution, in their official capacity.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. An international organization is not a State, so it does not have the same legal status as a State.\nC. All acts undertaken by State officials are not automatically considered acts jure imperii. The act must be carried out in an official State capacity.\nD. A State corporation is a private entity and does not have the same legal status as a State.",
