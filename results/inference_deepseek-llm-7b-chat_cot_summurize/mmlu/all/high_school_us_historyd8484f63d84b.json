Creation of a price-support system for small-scale farmers.\n\nassistant:The accomplishment of the political movement organized around the sentiments in the song lyrics above is the establishment of the minimum wage law. The lyrics describe how the railroads and party bosses oppressed a \"hayseed,\" which could refer to a small-scale farmer or agricultural worker. The establishment of the minimum wage law would have helped protect these workers from exploitation by large corporations and would have been a victory for the labor movement, which was a significant aspect of the Progressive Era in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Establishment of the minimum wage law.",
