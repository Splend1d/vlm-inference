One bucket is very close to you, and the other bucket is far away. Which one do you think is easier to fill with water?\n\nIn the same way, when people need help, it's easier for people who are nearby to help them. That's why Singer thinks that the people who help with famine (when people don't have enough food) in other countries do a better job at helping than we could if we were close to our neighbors.\n\nSo, the answer is A. more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors.",
