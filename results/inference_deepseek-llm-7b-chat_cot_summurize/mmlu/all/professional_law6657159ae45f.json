Reliance damages in the form of the actual expenses the producer incurred while negotiating with the singer.\nC. Restitution for any harm done to the producer's reputation when the production was abandoned.\nD. Nothing, because it was not reasonable for the producer to expect to be reimbursed for expenses incurred when he knew that the singer was not obligated until there was a final, signed agreement.\n\nassistant:The producer may be able to recover expectation damages, which are the profits that the production would have made if it had been performed. This is because the singer expressed interest in performing in the production and the parties agreed that there would be no enforceable contractual obligations until a final, signed contract was entered into. Therefore, the producer had a legitimate expectation that the singer would perform in the production.\n\nThe producer may not be able to recover reliance damages, which are the actual expenses the producer incurred while negotiating with the singer. This is because the producer made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to hire another singer before abandoning the production, which suggests that the producer should have been prepared for the possibility that the negotiations with the singer might not result in a final contract.\n\nThe producer may also not be able to recover restitution for any harm done to the producer's reputation when the production was abandoned. This is because there is no evidence that the singer's decision to not perform in the production was motivated by any intention to harm the producer's reputation.\n\nTherefore, the producer is likely to recover expectation damages in the form of the profits that the production would have made if it had been performed.
