This term is often used to describe the dynamic between these three entities in the United States government. Bureaucrats, legislators, and lobbyists all have an interest in the budget, and their actions and decisions can have a significant impact on the allocation of funds. Bureaucrats and legislators must often balance their own interests with those of their constituents, while lobbyists work to influence the decisions made by these groups. This complex relationship has led to a situation in which it can be difficult to make significant changes to the budget or other areas of government policy.",
