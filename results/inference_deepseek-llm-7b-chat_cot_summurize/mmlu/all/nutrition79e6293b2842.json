Weight loss in > than 10% or birth weight is not regained by day 14\n\nassistant:It is normal for babies to lose a small amount of weight in the first few days after birth, as they get used to the outside world and their feeding patterns adjust. However, a significant amount of weight loss can be a cause for concern. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, babies should regain their birth weight by their first week of life, and their weight should be back to its birth weight by 2 weeks of age. Therefore, the answer is C. Birth weight is not regained by day 7. This can be a sign of a medical issue, such as a tongue tie or a feeding problem, and it's important to bring this to the attention of your healthcare provider.",
