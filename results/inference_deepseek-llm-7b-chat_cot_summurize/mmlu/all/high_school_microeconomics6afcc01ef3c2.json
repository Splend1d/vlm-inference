You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: When price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, demand is\n\nA. perfectly inelastic.\nB. elastic.\nC. inelastic.\nD. unit elastic.\n\nassistant:When price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, it means that the demand for the product is very sensitive to price changes. In this case, the demand is considered to be elastic.\n\n elasticity of demand greater than 1 means that a relatively small change in price will cause a much larger change in demand for the product. This indicates that consumers are more responsive to price changes and are more likely to change their purchasing behavior in response to price changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. elastic.",
