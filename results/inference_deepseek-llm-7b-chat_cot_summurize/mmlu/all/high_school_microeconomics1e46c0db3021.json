A government subsidy.\nB. A government tax.\nC. A lower price.\nD. A higher level of output.\n\nassistant:A government tax would be a way to internalize the negative externality. This is because a tax can be placed on the activity that is causing the negative externality, such as pollution from a factory. The tax would make the activity more expensive, which would encourage the producer to reduce their output or find ways to reduce their pollution. This would help to correct the negative externality and make it less of a problem for society as a whole.\n\nA government subsidy, a lower price, and a higher level of output would not be effective in internalizing the negative externality. A government subsidy would not necessarily correct the negative externality, as it could simply be a transfer of resources from one group to another without any real change in the behavior causing the externality. A lower price would not necessarily correct the negative externality, as it would not necessarily change the behavior of the producer causing the externality. A higher level of output would not necessarily correct the negative externality, as it could actually make the problem worse if the producer is not taking steps to reduce their pollution or other negative impacts.",
