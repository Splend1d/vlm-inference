AP-handshaking\nB. 4-way handshake\nC. 4-way connection\nD. wireless handshaking\n\nassistant:The four-step authentication process that wireless users go through when authenticating to an Access Point is called the \"4-way handshake.\" This process ensures that both the wireless user and the Access Point are properly authenticated and that the connection is secure.\n\nThe 4-way handshake consists of the following steps:\n\n1. The wireless client sends a Clear To Send (CTS) signal to the Access Point, indicating that it is ready to transmit its authentication data.\n2. The Access Point responds with a CTS Accept signal, indicating that it is also ready to transmit.\n3. The wireless client sends its authentication data to the Access Point.\n4. The Access Point responds with an Authentication-Complete (ACK) signal, indicating that it has received the authentication data and that the authentication process is complete.\n\nIf the authentication process is successful, the wireless client is granted access to the Access Point's network. If the authentication process is unsuccessful, the wireless client is denied access to the network.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 4-way handshake.",
