Beneficial mutations can provide a selective advantage, such as improving the survival or reproduction of an organism. Neutral mutations do not affect the fitness of an organism, meaning that they do not provide an advantage or disadvantage. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, can have negative effects on the survival or reproduction of an organism, making it less fit in its environment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because mutations can appear in both heterozygotes and homozygotes. Option D is incorrect because allozyme studies (protein electrophoresis) is not the best method for detecting new mutations.",
