The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram\n\nThe poet Ruben Dario wrote \"To Roosevelt\" in 1904 in response to the Zimmerman Telegram, which was a secret telegram sent by Germany to Mexico in 1917, offering military support to Mexico in exchange for Mexico's help in defeating the United States in World War I. This telegram was intercepted by the United States and revealed Germany's plans to attack the United States. Dario's poem expresses the poet's anger and frustration with the United States and its aggressive expansionist policies in Latin America.",
