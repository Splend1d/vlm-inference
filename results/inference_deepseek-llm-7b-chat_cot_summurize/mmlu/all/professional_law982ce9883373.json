The woman, because the noise, coupled with the odors, substantially interfered with the use and enjoyment of her land.\nD. The woman, because the man was negligent in permitting the manure to be left unattended.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The woman, because the noise, coupled with the odors, substantially interfered with the use and enjoyment of her land.\n\nThis answer is supported by the information provided, which states that the woman had to endure the odors and noises from the stable on her property, which negatively affected her ability to enjoy her land. The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The man's inheritance of the property in 2000 does not affect the situation, as the stable had already been built before the woman purchased her estate in 2008.\n\nB. The fact that the stable was built on the man's land does not give him the right to cause a nuisance to the woman by allowing the manure to be left unattended. Homeowners are not entitled to make unreasonable use of their property.\n\nD. Although the man may have been negligent in not attending to the manure, this does not necessarily mean that the woman should have the right to enjoin his use of the stable. The noise and odors from the stable were the primary issue, not the unattended manure.",
