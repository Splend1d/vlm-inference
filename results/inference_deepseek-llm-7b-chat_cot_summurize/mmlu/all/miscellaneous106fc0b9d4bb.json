There will be a shortage.\nB. There will be a surplus.\nC. The demand curve for leather garments will shift leftward.\nD. The supply curve for leather garments will shift rightward.\n\nassistant:If the government places a price ceiling on leather garments that is below the equilibrium price, the market for leather garments will experience a shortage. This is because the price ceiling makes it difficult for producers to recover their costs, leading to a decrease in the quantity of leather garments produced. The demand curve for leather garments will not shift, as the price ceiling is imposed by the government and not a change in consumer preferences. The supply curve for leather garments will not shift either, as the price ceiling is imposed by the government and not a change in the cost of production. Therefore, the correct answer is A. There will be a shortage.",
