Serous drainage is a type of wound drainage that is characterized by the presence of clear or slightly yellow fluid. This type of drainage is typically caused by inflammation or infection of the tissues surrounding the wound. If the drainage contains red blood cells (A), it is likely to be purulent, which is a type of wound drainage that is characterized by the presence of pus. If the drainage is thick and yellow or green (C), it is likely to be serosanguinous, which is a type of wound drainage that contains both blood and serous fluid.",
