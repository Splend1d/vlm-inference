F\nB. Si\nC. O\nD. Ca\n\nassistant:To determine which atom has the lowest electron affinity, we can look at their electron affinity values listed in the periodic table. The electron affinity is the energy released when an electron is added to a gaseous atom or molecule, making it a diatomic or polyatomic ion.\n\nLet's look at the electron affinity values for each atom:\n\nA. F (fluorine): 3.96 eV\nB. Si (silicon): 5.58 eV\nC. O (oxygen): 4.06 eV\nD. Ca (calcium): 2.93 eV\n\nBased on these values, the atom with the lowest electron affinity is:\n\nC. O (oxygen), with an electron affinity of 4.06 eV.",
