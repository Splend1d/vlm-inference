Sometimes a drug's effects are the direct result of what one expects from the drug.\n\nIn the passage, Shapiro discusses experiments that show the role of expectations in the experience of drug use. He argues that expectations can influence the experience of drug use and even the outcome of the drug. This means that sometimes, a drug's effects are the direct result of what one expects from the drug.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not claim that drug effects are inherently biological and not influenced by psychological factors. In fact, the passage suggests that psychological factors like expectations can influence drug effects.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the passage does not claim that users who do not expect to get addicted to \"hard\" drugs almost always do. In fact, the passage suggests that expectations can influence the outcome of drug use, but it does not make any claims about the inevitability of addiction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not claim that there is no such thing as drug addiction. Instead, the passage suggests that psychological factors like expectations can influence the outcome of drug use.",
