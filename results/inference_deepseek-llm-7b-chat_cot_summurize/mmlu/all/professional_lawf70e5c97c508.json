During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher.

The question is improper because it is evidence of conduct not related to the truthfulness of the informer's testimony. The defendant's attorney is trying to suggest that the informer is not telling the truth because he is hoping to become a police officer and the police department might overlook his past misdemeanor convictions. This is not relevant to the informer's truthfulness or his knowledge of the stolen property case. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.",
