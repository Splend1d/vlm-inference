Three suitcases are selected at random. What is the probability that exactly 2 are damaged?\n\nA. 2/69\nB. 1/30\nC. 2/23\nD. 12/125\n\nassistant:Let's denote the probability of selecting a damaged suitcase as p and the probability of selecting a non-damaged suitcase as q. We know that the total probability should be 1, so we have:\n\np + q = 1\n\nWe also know that there are 5 damaged suitcases out of 25, so:\n\np = 5/25 = 1/5\n\nNow we need to find the probability of selecting 2 damaged suitcases out of 3. The total number of ways to select 3 suitcases out of 25 is:\n\nC(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * (25-3)!) = 4375\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 is:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10\n\nThe number of ways to select 1 damaged suitcase and 1 non-damaged suitcase out of the remaining 20 is:\n\nC(20, 1) * C(20, 1) = 20! / (1! * (20-1)!) * 20! / (1! * (20-1)!) = 200\n\nSo, the number of successful outcomes is:\n\n10 * 200 = 2000\n\nThe total number of outcomes is 4375, so the probability of selecting exactly 2 damaged suitcases is:\n\n2000 / 4375 = 2 / 69\n\nThe correct answer is A. 2/69.",
