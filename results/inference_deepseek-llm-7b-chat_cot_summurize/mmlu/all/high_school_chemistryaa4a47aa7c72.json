Increasing [Fe2+]\nB. Adding more Fe(s)\nC. Decreasing [Fe2+]\nD. Removing some Fe(s)\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Removing some Fe(s) would cause an increase in potential in the voltaic cell described by the above reaction. This is because the reaction is a reduction reaction, where Fe(s) is reduced to Fe2+ and the potential decreases as the reaction proceeds. Therefore, removing some Fe(s) would increase the concentration of Fe2+ ions, causing the cell potential to increase.\n\nIncreasing [Fe2+] (Option A) would decrease the potential of the cell, as it would decrease the concentration of reduced Fe2+ ions. Adding more Fe(s) (Option B) would also decrease the potential of the cell, as it would increase the concentration of Fe2+ ions. Decreasing [Fe2+] (Option C) would increase the potential of the cell, as it would increase the concentration of reduced Fe2+ ions.",
