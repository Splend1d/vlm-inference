Which statement best describes the behavior of the gas molecules?\n\nA. Their velocity increases by a factor of two.\nB. Their velocity increases by a factor of four.\nC. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2.\nD. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nassistant:The answer is D. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nWhen a gas is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases because they gain more energy through collisions with the container walls and other molecules. However, the specific increase in kinetic energy is not a simple factor like in option A or B. The increase in kinetic energy depends on factors such as the initial temperature, final temperature, and the specific gas being heated.\n\nIn this case, the sample of oxygen gas is heated from 50 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of a molecule at a temperature T is given by the formula:\n\nKE_avg = (3/2) * R * T\n\nwhere KE_avg is the average kinetic energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in kelvins.\n\nAt 50 \u00b0C, the average kinetic energy of the oxygen molecules is:\n\nKE_avg_initial = (3/2) * R * 50\n\nAt 100 \u00b0C, the average kinetic energy of the oxygen molecules is:\n\nKE_avg_final = (3/2) * R * 100\n\nThe ratio of the final to the initial kinetic energy is:\n\n(KE_avg_final / KE_avg_initial) = ((3/2) * R * 100 / (3/2) * R * 50) = (3/2) * 100 / 50 = 90/50 = 1.8\n\nSo, the increase in kinetic energy is less than a factor of 2, which is why option D is the correct answer.",
