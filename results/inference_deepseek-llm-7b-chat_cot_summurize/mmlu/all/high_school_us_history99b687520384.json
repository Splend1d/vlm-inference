The passage you provided, written by Frederick Douglass in 1857, highlights the complete organization of the slaveholders and the support they receive from various institutions such as the State governments, the church organizations, and the Federal Government. This organization and support are seen as a direct result of the Second Great Awakening, which was a religious revival movement that emphasized individual conversion and personal piety. This movement led to the establishment of many churches and religious organizations, which in turn became powerful forces that supported and propagated the institution of slavery.",
