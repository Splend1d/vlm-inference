Assume a Classical aggregate supply curve.\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\nD. The equilibrium price level remains unchanged while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nassistant:If the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it means that the supply of goods and services in the economy becomes less responsive to changes in price. This can occur due to factors such as a decrease in the price of inputs used in production, an increase in the number of workers available to produce goods and services, or changes in the technology used in production.\n\nIn the short run, the aggregate supply curve is typically downward-sloping, meaning that as the price level increases, the quantity of goods and services produced also increases. This is because as prices rise, firms tend to increase production to capture the higher profits that can be earned from higher prices.\n\nIf the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it means that the leftward shift in the curve increases the responsiveness of supply to changes in price. This means that even small changes in price will now result in larger changes in the quantity of goods and services produced.\n\nIn the case of a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve, the equilibrium price level will remain unchanged. This is because the curve has shifted to the left, which means that the price level has become less sensitive to changes in the quantity of goods and services produced.\n\nHowever, the equilibrium quantity of output will increase due to the leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve. This is because the curve has become less responsive to changes in price, meaning that even small changes in price will now result in larger changes in the quantity of goods and services produced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The equilibrium price level remains unchanged while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.",
