Biotin\nB. Niacin\nC. Riboflavin\nD. Thiamin\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Niacin.\n\nNiacin is a coenzyme that is involved in carboxylation reactions, which are important in various metabolic processes in the body. It is also known as Vitamin B3.\n\nBiotin, Riboflavin, and Thiamin are also essential vitamins, but they do not serve as coenzymes for carboxylation reactions. Biotin is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, while Riboflavin and Thiamin are involved in various metabolic processes such as energy production and red blood cell formation.",
