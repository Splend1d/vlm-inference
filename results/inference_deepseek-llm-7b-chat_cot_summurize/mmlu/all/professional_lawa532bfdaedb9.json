No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.\n\nThe covenant not to compete was valid when it was signed, but the employer cannot enforce it now. The employee's argument that there was no consideration is correct. The \"at will\" provision in the employment contract did allow the employer to terminate the employment upon reasonable notice, but it does not make the covenant not to compete enforceable. The employer cannot rely on the fact that it provided the employee with continued employment after the covenant was signed. The employer should have provided something of value to the employee in exchange for signing the covenant, such as continued employment or a bonus. Therefore, the employer does not have a legal right to enforce the covenant.",
