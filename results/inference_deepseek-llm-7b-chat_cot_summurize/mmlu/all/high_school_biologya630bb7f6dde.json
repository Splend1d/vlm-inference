The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n\nassistant:The best explanation for this phenomenon is option A. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance, where neither trait is dominant; the expression of the genes shows a blending of traits. This means that the gene for flower color in hydrangea plants has two alleles, one for blue flowers and one for pink flowers. When a plant with one blue and one pink flower allele is grown in blue soil, the plant will produce blue flowers. However, when the plant is grown in pink soil, the plant will produce pink flowers, as the pink flower allele is expressed. This blending of traits is referred to as incomplete dominance, and it is a type of genetic inheritance where the effects of two genes are not entirely additive or entirely dominant, but rather there is a partial suppression of the effect of one gene by the other.",
