Which statement best describes the consequence of the CPA\u2019s lack of inquiry?\n\nA. The CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty.\nB. The CPA may be charged with preparing a fraudulent return\nC. The client will not owe an understatement penalty if the return is audited and the expenses disallowed\nD. The client will not be subject to a fraud penalty\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty.\n\nWhen a CPA prepares a client's tax return, they are required to follow the professional standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). One of these standards is the requirement to make a reasonable inquiry into the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by the client.\n\nIf the CPA fails to make a reasonable inquiry, and the tax return includes incorrect or incomplete information, the CPA may be liable for a tax return preparer penalty. This penalty is assessed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and can be up to $120,000 for a single return.\n\nIn this case, the CPA did not inquire about the documentation for the business travel expenses, which means that the tax return may contain incorrect or incomplete information. Therefore, the CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The CPA may be charged with preparing a fraudulent return: This statement is not necessarily true. The CPA may have made a reasonable inquiry, but still prepared an incorrect tax return.\n\nC. The client will not owe an understatement penalty if the return is audited and the expenses disallowed: This statement is not necessarily true. Even if the expenses are disallowed, the client may still owe an understatement penalty if the tax return is inaccurate.\n\nD. The client will not be subject to a fraud penalty: This statement is not necessarily true. The client may still be subject to a fraud penalty if the CPA prepared an intentionally false tax return.",
