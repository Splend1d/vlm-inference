What is the power of the test?\n\nA. 0.26\nB. 0.05\nC. 0.95\nD. 0.74\n\nassistant:To calculate the power of the test, we can use the following formula:\n\nPower = P(H0 is rejected when H0 is false) - P(H0 is not rejected when H0 is false)\n\nIn this case, we are given P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) = 0.05 and P(failing to reject H0 when H0 is false) = 0.26.\n\nPower = 0.26 - 0.26 = 0\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 0.74. The test has a power of 0.74, which means that it has a 74% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false.",
