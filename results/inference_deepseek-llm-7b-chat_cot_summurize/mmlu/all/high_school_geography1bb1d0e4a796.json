Dairy foods\nB. Bulk-gaining products\nC. Single-market products\nD. Bulk-reducing products\n\nassistant:To determine which industry does NOT need to be close to its market, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Dairy foods: Dairy products are perishable and need to be transported and stored at specific temperatures. They can be transported over long distances, so being close to the market is not a requirement for the dairy industry.\n\nB. Bulk-gaining products: These are products that are primarily used for bulk storage, such as grains, fertilizers, and construction materials. These products can be transported over long distances and are not specifically tied to being close to their markets.\n\nC. Single-market products: These are products that are primarily intended for a specific market or region, such as locally grown fruits and vegetables. These products are often fresher and more profitable if they are sold locally, so being close to the market is a requirement for the single-market products industry.\n\nD. Bulk-reducing products: These are products that are primarily used for reducing the volume of materials, such as packaging materials or waste management products. These products can be transported over long distances and are not specifically tied to being close to their markets.\n\nBased on this analysis, the industry that does NOT need to be close to its market is C. Single-market products.",
