How much does the bank have in excess reserves? What is the size of the money multiplier?\n\nA. 25% $750 M = \u00bc\nB. 75% $250 M = 4\nC. 25% $750 M = 4\nD. 75% $750 M = \u00bc\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will calculate the reserve ratio, excess reserves, and the money multiplier.\n\n1. Reserve ratio:\nThe reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to keep in reserve. In this case, the bank has to reserve 25% of the $1000 in checking deposits, which is 0.25 \\* $1000 = $250.\n\n2. Excess reserves:\nThe excess reserves are the amount of money the bank has in reserve that exceeds the required reserves. In this case, the excess reserves are $1000 - $250 = $750.\n\n3. Money multiplier:\nThe money multiplier is the number of times a bank can multiply its reserve to increase its total deposits. In this case, the money multiplier is $750/$250 = 3.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nA. 25% $750 M = \u00bc\nB. 75% $750 M = 4\nC. 25% $750 M = 4\nD. 75% $750 M = \u00bc\n\nAnswer: D. 75% $750 M = \u00bc",
