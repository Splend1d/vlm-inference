Stress and loss of social support\nB. Having the same disorder as the deceased\nC. The inability to remarry quickly\nD. They have the same defective genes\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Stress and loss of social support.\n\nAfter losing a spouse, the surviving spouse is often left with a significant amount of stress and a lack of social support, which can lead to a higher risk of death within the first year. This can be due to a variety of factors, including the emotional toll of losing a spouse, the burden of managing household responsibilities alone, and a decrease in social connections and support networks.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it is unlikely that the surviving spouse would have the same disorder as the deceased, and even if they did, it would not necessarily cause them to die within the first year.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it is not a direct cause of the surviving spouse's increased risk of death within the first year. While remarrying may provide some social support, it is not a guaranteed solution to the stress and challenges faced by the surviving spouse.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is not a common cause of death for surviving spouses. Having the same defective genes would be a genetic condition, but it is unlikely that both the deceased and surviving spouse would have the same condition.",
