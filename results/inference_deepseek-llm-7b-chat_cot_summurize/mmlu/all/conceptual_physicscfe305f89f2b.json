None of these\n\nassistant:The period of a wave is defined as the time it takes for one complete cycle of the wave. To find the period of a 10-Hz wave, we can use the formula:\n\nPeriod (T) = 1 / Frequency (f)\n\nGiven that the frequency of the wave is 10 Hz, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nT = 1 / 10\n\nT = 0.1 s\n\nSo, the period of the 10-Hz wave is 0.1 seconds, which is not among the options provided. Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of these.",
