Approximately how many boxes of cat food does he use per month?\n\nA. 2 boxes\nB. 4 boxes\nC. 5 boxes\nD. 6 boxes\n\nassistant:To calculate how many boxes of cat food Rob uses per month, we can first find out how many days are in a month and then divide the number of days Rob uses one box by the number of days in a month and multiply by the number of boxes per month.\n\nThere are approximately 30 days in a month (30.436875 to be precise). So, we can calculate the number of boxes Rob uses per month as follows:\n\n30 days/5 days = 6 boxes/month\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 6 boxes.",
