The motel manager authorized the officers to enter the room and provided them with a passkey.

The officers then heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. They then used the passkey and entered the room, where they saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet.

Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.\nD. Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.\n\nassistant:C. Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.\n\nThe court should not grant the motion to suppress. While it is true that exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry, the fact that they did not obtain a warrant before entering the room is not excusable under these circumstances. Exigent circumstances refer to situations in which there is a risk to life or property that requires immediate action, such as the situation described in the question where drug dealing was suspected to be taking place in the motel room.\n\nIn this case, the officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was occurring in the room, and the motel manager had authorized their entry. However, even in situations of exigent circumstances, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that law enforcement obtain a warrant before entering a home or other private property, unless there is a showing of exigent circumstances that justifies a warrantless entry.\n\nIn this case, the officers did not obtain a warrant before entering the room, and it is not clear whether they were able to show that they had exigent circumstances that justified a warrantless entry. The officers' actions of knocking on the door, announcing their presence, and telling the occupants that they wanted to speak with them before entering the room could have given the occupants time to dispose of the drugs, which would have made it more difficult for the officers to prove that drug dealing was occurring.\n\nTherefore, the court should not grant the motion to suppress the drugs, as the officers did not have a warrant, and it is not clear whether they were able to show that exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry.",
