At trial, the plaintiff was asked on direct examination if he remembered the explosion. He replied, \"I recall my son running into the home and screaming that the car windows just shattered. \" The son was available to testify at trial.

Therefore, the trial judge should rule that the plaintiff's testimony is admissible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. inadmissible under the excited utterance exception, because it can be a product of reflection and deliberation.",
