False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true. The order of the product of two subgroups H and K is the product of their orders, assuming that H and K have non-zero intersection.\n\nStatement 2: A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This statement is also true. A group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, is either cyclic (i.e., isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2p) or is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which corresponds to answer A.
