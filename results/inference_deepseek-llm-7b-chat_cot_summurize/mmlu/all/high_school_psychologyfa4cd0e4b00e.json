Nell's decision exemplifies\n\nA. prepared conditioning\nB. tutelage\nC. scheduled reinforcement\nD. vicarious learning\n\nassistant:Nell's decision not to throw her stuffed animal in the toilet after witnessing her brother Matthew being punished for doing so is an example of vicarious learning. Vicarious learning refers to the process by which an individual learns from the experiences of others, without necessarily directly participating in those experiences themselves. In this case, Nell observed Matthew's punishment for putting his stuffed animal in the toilet and used that experience to guide her own behavior. She did not directly experience the negative consequences of putting her stuffed animal in the toilet, but she learned from Matthew's experience and made a different decision based on that learning. This is different from prepared conditioning, tutelage, and scheduled reinforcement, which involve more direct and specific forms of learning.",
