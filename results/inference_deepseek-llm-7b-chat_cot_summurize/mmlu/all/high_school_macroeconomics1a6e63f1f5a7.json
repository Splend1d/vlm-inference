In this case, the market system has determined that there is a demand for digital cameras over 35-mm cameras, and firms have responded by producing more digital cameras and fewer 35-mm cameras. This is not an example of central planners dictating which cameras are produced (option A), the market system answering the question of \"who\" should consume the cameras that are produced (option D), or the market system answering the question of \"how\" cameras should be produced (option B).",
