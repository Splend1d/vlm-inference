In this case, the water main break and the resulting accident were caused by the negligence of the construction company, which was hired by the water department. The water department may be held strictly liable for the construction company's negligence, as they had a duty to ensure that the repair work was done properly (a non-delegable duty). Sovereign immunity would not apply in this situation, as the duty in question is proprietary in nature.",
