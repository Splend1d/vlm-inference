OLS minimises the sum of the horizontal distances from the points to the line\nD. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the horizontal distances from the points to the line.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line. This is a fundamental principle in linear regression analysis, and it is known as the least squares criterion. The goal of OLS estimation is to find the linear equation that best fits the observed data, and the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (also known as the residuals) is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model.",
