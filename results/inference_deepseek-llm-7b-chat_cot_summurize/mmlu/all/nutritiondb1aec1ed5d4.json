It will have negative impacts in most developing countries because of the increased frequency of droughts, storms and floods.\nB. The impact will be positive, because drier weather will mean less habitat for malaria mosquitoes, so fewer workers will be sick at harvest time.\nC. The impact will be positive because there will be more carbon dioxide available for plant photosynthesis.\nD. There currently is no scientific consensus as to whether climate change is occurring or whether it will over the next 50 years.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A.\n\nClimate change is expected to have negative impacts on future food security in most developing countries. As temperatures rise and weather patterns become more extreme, such as the increased frequency of droughts, storms, and floods, agricultural production is likely to decrease. This can lead to food shortages and malnutrition, especially for those who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while drier weather may lead to fewer malaria mosquitoes, it does not address the broader impacts of climate change on food security.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while increased carbon dioxide can lead to more plant growth, the long-term effects of climate change on photosynthesis are not well understood. Additionally, the increased carbon dioxide may lead to more extreme weather events, which could further impact food security.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and that it is likely to have negative impacts on food security in the coming decades.",
