Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.\n\nThe developer's federal constitutional claim will likely not prevail with option C. The developer's argument is based on the idea that the city's rezoning of the property was discriminatory spot zoning, which constitutes a taking of the property without just compensation. This argument may have some merit, as the rezoning of the property was indeed discriminatory, and the developer did not receive just compensation for the loss of his property. However, the developer's argument that the rezoning was an illegal act once a building permit was granted is not likely to be successful. The city had the authority to rezone the property, and the developer's reliance on the building permit does not necessarily mean that the rezoning was an illegal act. Additionally, the fact that other adjoining landowners were also rezoned does not necessarily mean that the developer shared the loss with them, as they may have had the opportunity to appeal the rezoning. Therefore, option C is the most likely answer.",
