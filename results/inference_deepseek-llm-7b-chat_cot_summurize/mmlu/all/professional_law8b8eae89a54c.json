This is known as a \"quasi-contract,\" which is a contract that arises from a voluntary action of one party to benefit another, even though no direct promise was made. In this case, the man's notice in the newspaper created an offer for a reward, and the detective's actions in providing information that led to the arrest and conviction of the murderer fulfilled the conditions of the offer. Therefore, the detective is entitled to the $10,000 reward.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. This option is not relevant, as the detective's lack of knowledge of the reward notice does not affect his entitlement to the reward.\nC. This option is also not relevant, as the detective's lack of knowledge of the reward notice does not negate his fulfillment of the conditions required to receive the reward.\nD. This option is incorrect, as the quasi-contract created by the detective's actions satisfies the requirements of the offer made in the reward notice.",
