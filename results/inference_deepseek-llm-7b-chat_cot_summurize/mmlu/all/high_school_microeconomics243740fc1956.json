Concave to the origin. When opportunity cost is constant across all production levels, the production possibilities frontier (PPF) will be concave to the origin, meaning that there will be more efficient combinations of goods that can be produced at lower opportunity cost. This is because the PPF will be shaped like a \"U\" or \"V\" curve, with the \"bottom\" of the curve being the most efficient combinations of goods that can be produced.",
