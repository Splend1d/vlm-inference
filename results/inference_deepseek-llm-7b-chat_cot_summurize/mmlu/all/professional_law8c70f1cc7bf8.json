The plant is located in a rural area in the southwestern part of the state. In its production of paraquat, the company emits putrid smelling fumes throughout the surrounding countryside. Although the fumes are harmless to health, they are rank and highly offensive. Despite extensive research by the company to alleviate the problem, there is no known way to manufacture paraquat without discharging malodorous fumes into the air. An owner of a large dairy farm that is adjacent to the plant finds the foul-smelling herbicide fumes to be extremely unpleasant and totally objectionable. The owner brings an action based on private nuisance against the company and seeks to enjoin the manufacture of paraquat at the chemical plant. Which of the following facts, if proven, will be most helpful to the company's defense?\n\nA. Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce paraquat.\nB. The company has a contract with the federal government whereby it supplies 80 percent of its paraquat production to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which uses the herbicide as a marijuana eradicator.\nC. The company commenced the manufacture of paraquat at the plant before the owner acquired the land and built his dairy farm.\nD. Paraquat is the only herbicide that can safely and effectively kill marijuana, which, if not controlled, poses a serious drug-enforcement problem.\n",

This fact would demonstrate that the company was using the plant and equipment to produce paraquat before the dairy farm was built and would therefore not be responsible for the offensive odors that the dairy farm owner is objecting to.",
