It was a very big city with many buildings and people living there. It was not equipped with sophisticated plumbing and cooling systems like in urban centers of the Indus Valley. The city was not subject to constant outbreaks of plague and disease like in some ancient cities. However, it was planned and built on a grid pattern, which means that the streets and buildings were arranged in a regular and systematic way.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. planned and built on a grid pattern.",
