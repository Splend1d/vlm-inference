Two weeks before finals, Conrad is studying for hours each day to prepare. Right after finals at the start of summer vacation, Conrad comes down with the flu. Which of the following theories best explains this chain of events?\n\nA. Selye's general adaptation syndrome\nB. Yerkes-Dodson law\nC. Thorndike's law of effect\nD. Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory\n\nassistant:The theory that best explains this chain of events is Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. According to Festinger, when people hold two or more contradictory beliefs, it creates a state of tension or dissonance in their minds. In this case, Conrad believed that studying hard for finals would help him perform well, but he also believed that the flu would prevent him from studying. This contradiction created tension, and his body's response was to come down with the flu to reduce the dissonance. The other options do not directly relate to this chain of events:\n\nA. Selye's general adaptation syndrome is a general theory of how the body responds to stress, but it does not specifically explain the flu.\nB. Yerkes-Dodson law is a theory that states that performance on a task increases with the level of arousal (e.g., excitement or anxiety), but it does not explain the flu.\nC. Thorndike's law of effect is a theory that states people tend to repeat behaviors that are followed by positive outcomes and avoid behaviors that are followed by negative outcomes. It does not explain the flu in this scenario.",
