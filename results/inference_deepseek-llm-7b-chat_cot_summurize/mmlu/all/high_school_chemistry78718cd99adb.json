Balance the half-reaction for bromate ions forming bromine. The balanced half-reaction has\n\nA. 6 electrons on the left\nB. 6 electrons on the right\nC. 3 electrons on the left\nD. 10 electrons on the left\n\nassistant:The balanced half-reaction for bromate ions forming bromine is:\n\nBrO3- + e- -> Br2\n\nThis half-reaction is balanced because the number of Br atoms on the left side (BrO3-) is equal to the number of Br atoms on the right side (Br2). Additionally, the half-reaction has 6 electrons on the left side (from the BrO3-) and 6 electrons on the right side (lost during the reduction of BrO3- to Br2). Therefore, the answer is B. 6 electrons on the right.",
