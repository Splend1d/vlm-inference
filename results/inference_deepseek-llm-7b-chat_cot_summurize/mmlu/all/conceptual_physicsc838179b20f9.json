The pitch of a sound is primarily determined by its frequency, which is the number of oscillations per second. Frequency is the relationship between the number of waves that pass a given point in a given amount of time. Frequency is related to pitch, as higher frequency waves produce higher pitches and lower frequency waves produce lower pitches.",
