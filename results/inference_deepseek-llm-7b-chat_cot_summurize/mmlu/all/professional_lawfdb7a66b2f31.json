The War Powers Act gives Congress the power to regulate the use of military forces abroad and to terminate the use of such forces. The statute in question is an exercise of this power.\n\nA. is incorrect because the President, in this instance, has not been called by Congress into actual service as Commander-in-Chief.\nC. is incorrect because the President does have the authority to execute the laws of the United States, but this statute is within the power of Congress under the War Powers Act.\nD. is incorrect because the President is still the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and this statute is within the power of Congress under the War Powers Act.",
