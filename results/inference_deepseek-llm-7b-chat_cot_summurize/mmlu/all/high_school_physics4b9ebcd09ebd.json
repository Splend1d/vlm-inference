Afterward, which of the following is a possible combination of net charges for the two spheres?\n\nA. +3e and -4e\nB. +1.5e and -2.5e\nC. Both of the above\nD. None of the above\n\nassistant:Let's reason about the multi-choice question step by step.\nAfter the two spheres come into contact, the net charge of the system must be zero. This means that the total charge on one sphere must be equal to the negative of the total charge on the other sphere.\nLet's call the net charge of the first sphere +5e and the net charge of the second sphere -6e.\nThe total charge on the first sphere is +5e, and the total charge on the second sphere is -6e.\nSo, the total charge on the first sphere is equal to the total charge on the second sphere.\nTherefore, the net charge of the two spheres is +5e and -6e, which is a possible combination of net charges for the two spheres.\nThe answer is C. Both of the above.\nThe answer is C.",
