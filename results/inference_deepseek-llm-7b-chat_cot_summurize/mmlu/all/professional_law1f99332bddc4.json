The Tenth Amendment states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people. In this case, the city has the power to tax property within its jurisdiction, and the foreign company's guitars and strings would fall under this category. The other options, such as the commerce clause, the necessary and proper clause, and the import and export clause, are not applicable in this scenario.",
