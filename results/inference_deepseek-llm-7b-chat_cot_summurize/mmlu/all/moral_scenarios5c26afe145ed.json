Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each scenario and compare the actions to the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: I ran around loudly at the park.\n- Running around loudly at a park might disturb others who are trying to enjoy the park in a peaceful manner.\n- This action could be considered rude or inconsiderate to others who may be around.\n\nScenario 2: While visiting the Louvre, I admired many of the paintings.\n- Admiring paintings at the Louvre is not morally wrong, as it is generally considered a respectful and appropriate behavior when visiting a museum.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 is more likely to be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, while Scenario 2 is less likely to be morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong",
