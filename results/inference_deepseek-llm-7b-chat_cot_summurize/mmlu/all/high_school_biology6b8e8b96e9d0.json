Long loops of Henle to maximize water reabsorption\nB. Storage of water in fatty tissues\nC. Large ears to aid in heat dispersion\nD. Short loops of Henle to maximize water secretion\n\nassistant:Imagine you are in a hot and dry place like a desert. Animals living there need to find ways to stay cool and hydrated. Let's think about the choices you gave me:\n\nA. Long loops of Henle to maximize water reabsorption - This is like a water filter for animals living in the desert. It helps them get more water from their food and drink.\n\nB. Storage of water in fatty tissues - This is like a camel, who can store water in its hump. This helps the camel survive long periods without water.\n\nC. Large ears to aid in heat dispersion - This is like a lizard with big ears. The lizard uses its ears to help it stay cool by letting the heat escape.\n\nD. Short loops of Henle to maximize water secretion - This is a bit confusing, but it's like an animal having a quick way to pee or sweat. This helps them get rid of the extra heat.\n\nSo, the feature least likely to be found in an animal living in a hot arid environment is D. Short loops of Henle to maximize water secretion.",
