An increase in the marginal propensity to consume\nB. A decreased velocity of money\nC. An increase in the marginal propensity to save\nD. An increase in the real interest rate\n\nassistant:The spending multiplier is a measure of the responsiveness of output to changes in spending. According to the Keynesian multiplier, an increase in spending leads to an increase in output, and the size of this increase is determined by the spending multiplier.\n\nTo answer your question, the spending multiplier tends to increase when the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) increases. The marginal propensity to consume is the fraction of income that is spent, and it represents the proportion of additional income that is likely to be spent rather than saved or invested.\n\nIf the MPC increases, then a given increase in spending will lead to a larger increase in output, and thus a higher spending multiplier. This is because more of the additional income will be spent, rather than saved or invested, leading to a larger increase in aggregate demand and output.\n\nThe other factors you mentioned - a decreased velocity of money, an increase in the marginal propensity to save, and an increase in the real interest rate - can all have effects on the economy, but they are not directly related to the spending multiplier.",
