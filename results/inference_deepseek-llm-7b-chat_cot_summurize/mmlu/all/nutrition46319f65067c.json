Muscle contains less water than fat\nB. Muscle contains more water than fat\nC. Muscle weighs more than fat\nD. Muscle weighs less than fat\n\nassistant:A. Muscle contains less water than fat.\n\nBioelectrical impedance uses the principle of electrical conductivity to estimate body composition. The electrical current travels faster through muscle because muscle fibers contain less water than fat cells. This allows the current to flow more easily through the muscle tissue, which is why the impedance is lower when measuring muscle.",
