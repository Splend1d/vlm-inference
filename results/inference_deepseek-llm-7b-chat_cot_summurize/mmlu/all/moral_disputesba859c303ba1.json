In this case, the being in question is incapable of moral reasoning, so it cannot be a moral patient.\n\nB. a moral agent refers to a being that is capable of making moral decisions and exercising moral agency. Since the being in question is incapable of moral reasoning, it cannot be a moral agent.\n\nC. an object of moral sympathy refers to a being that evokes feelings of compassion or empathy from others. Although the being in question may evoke such feelings, it cannot be an object of moral sympathy because it is incapable of moral reasoning.\n\nD. a being of value refers to a being that has intrinsic worth or value. While the being in question may have value in some sense, its inability to engage in moral reasoning means that it cannot be considered a being of value in the full sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. a moral patient.",
