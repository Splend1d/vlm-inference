Armed attack includes all types of armed force.\n\nThe term \"armed attack\" in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter refers to any use of armed force against a member state. This provision grants member states the right to self-defense in case of an armed attack. However, it does not include terrorist attacks or high intensity instances of armed force, as these are not necessarily considered armed attacks under international law.",
