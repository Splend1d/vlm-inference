Statement 2| The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: The set of all rectangles in the 2D plane (which includes non axis-aligned rectangles) can shatter a set of 5 points.\n\nThis statement is false. The set of all rectangles in the 2D plane cannot shatter a set of 5 points. The concept of shattering involves partitioning the points into regions that satisfy certain conditions, and the set of all rectangles in the 2D plane does not satisfy these conditions for a set of 5 points.\n\nStatement 2: The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nThis statement is true. The VC-dimension of a classifier is the smallest number of training examples that is required to learn an arbitrary function. In this case, the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 has a VC-dimension of infinite, meaning that it can perfectly fit any arbitrary function.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
