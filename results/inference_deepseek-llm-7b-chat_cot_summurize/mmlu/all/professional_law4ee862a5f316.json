The state has a rational basis for distinguishing between non-physicians who are not presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids and those who are. The law does not deny non-physicians who are not presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids the equal protection of the law, and it does not violate the commerce clause. Therefore, the correct answer is A. constitutional.",
