This is because publicly held companies are those in which the ownership is divided into shares that are traded publicly on a stock exchange. The stockholders own the company by holding the shares and have the power to vote on matters such as electing the board of directors or approving major corporate actions. The CEO and the president are the executives who manage the company on a day-to-day basis, while the government may have certain regulations and oversight roles, but it does not own the company. Therefore, the correct answer is B. the stockholders.",
