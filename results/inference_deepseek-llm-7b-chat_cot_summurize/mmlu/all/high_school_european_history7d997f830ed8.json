The Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly\nD. An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas\n\nassistant:The encomienda system was a method used by the Spanish conquerors to regulate the indigenous people they had conquered. It involved assigning indigenous people to work for the Spanish conquerors, who would receive a portion of their labor as tribute. This system was used during the colonization of the Americas and was not ended by any of the given options.\n\nOption A, the protests of the Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor, does not specify the ending of the encomienda system. The missionaries may have protested abuses, but they did not end the system.\n\nOption B, the lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores, does not explain why the encomienda system would be ended. The lack of new land does not necessarily mean that the existing system would be abolished.\n\nOption C, the Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly, also does not explain why the encomienda system would be ended. The crown's desire for control does not necessarily mean that they would end the existing system.\n\nOption D, an increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas, is the most likely explanation for the ending of the encomienda system. As mestizos (individuals of mixed Spanish and indigenous heritage) increased in number, they would have been forbidden from working on the encomiendas. This would have meant that the Spanish conquerors would have fewer laborers to assign to their encomiendas, which could have led to the system's eventual demise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomiendas, is the reason that the encomienda system was not ended.",
