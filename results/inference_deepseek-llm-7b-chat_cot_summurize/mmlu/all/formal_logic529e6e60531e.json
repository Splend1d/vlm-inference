M \u2228 S: This formula represents the disjunction of two propositions, M (Dylan likes math) and S (Dylan likes science). The sentence states that Dylan likes neither math nor science, which means he dislikes both. Since disliking math and disliking science are not the same thing, this option does not accurately represent the sentence.\n\nB. ~(M \u2022 S): This formula represents the existential conjunction of two propositions, M (Dylan likes math) and S (Dylan likes science). The sentence states that Dylan likes neither math nor science, which means he does not like both. However, this option does not accurately represent the sentence, as it implies that Dylan likes at least one of the two.\n\nC. ~(M \u2228 S): This formula represents the existential complement of the disjunction of two propositions, M (Dylan likes math) and S (Dylan likes science). The sentence states that Dylan likes neither math nor science, which means he does not satisfy the disjunction of liking math or science. This option accurately represents the meaning of the sentence.\n\nD. ~M \u2228 ~S: This formula represents the universal complement of the disjunction of two propositions, M (Dylan likes math) and S (Dylan likes science). The sentence states that Dylan likes neither math nor science, which means he does not satisfy the disjunction of liking math or science. However, this option does not accurately represent the sentence, as it implies that Dylan likes at least one of the two.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best symbolization of the given sentence is option C. ~(M \u2228 S).",
