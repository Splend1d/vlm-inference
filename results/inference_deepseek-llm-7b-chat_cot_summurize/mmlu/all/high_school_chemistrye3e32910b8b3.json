The nitrate ions are not involved in the reaction and are only present as spectator ions. This option represents a possible reaction.\n\nOption B: 3Mg(s) + 2Cr3+ \u2192 3Mg2+ + 2Cr(s)\nThis option shows that magnesium is oxidized to magnesium ions (Mg2+) and chromium is reduced to chromium metal (Cr). The nitrate ions are not involved in the reaction and are only present as spectator ions. This option does not represent a possible reaction, as magnesium metal is not oxidized in this case.\n\nOption C: Mg(s) + Cr3+ \u2192 Mg2+ + Cr(s)\nThis option shows that magnesium is oxidized to magnesium ions (Mg2+) and chromium is reduced to chromium metal (Cr). The nitrate ions are not involved in the reaction and are only present as spectator ions. This option does not represent a possible reaction, as magnesium metal is not oxidized in this case.\n\nOption D: 3Mg(s) + 2Cr(NO3)3(aq) \u2192 3Mg2+(aq) + 2Cr(s) + NO3-(aq)\nThis option shows that magnesium is oxidized to magnesium ions (Mg2+) and chromium is reduced to chromium metal (Cr). The nitrate ions are involved in the reaction and are consumed as products. This option does not represent a possible reaction, as it involves the consumption of nitrate ions, which is not the case in the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct net ionic equation is:\n\nA. Mg(s) + Cr(NO3)3(aq) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + Cr3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)",
