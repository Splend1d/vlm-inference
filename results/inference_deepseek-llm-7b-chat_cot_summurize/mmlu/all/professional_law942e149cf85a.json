The defendant's rights against double jeopardy would be violated if he were to be prosecuted again for the same crime after a mistrial has been granted. However, the city and state statutes are separate and distinct from each other, and the defendant's prosecution under the city's anti-smoking ordinance would not be a retrial of the same offense. Therefore, the defendant's motion to dismiss should be denied.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because jeopardy does not attach in the first prosecution when a mistrial is granted. Answer B is incorrect because the fact that the law and evidence will be identical at the second trial does not prevent the defendant's prosecution under the city's anti-smoking ordinance. Answer D is incorrect because the judge's grant of a mistrial does not prevent the city attorney from prosecuting the defendant under the city's anti-smoking ordinance.",
