Find the probability that $abc = 180$.\n\nA. \\frac{1}{30}\nB. \\frac{1}{72}\nC. \\frac{1}{71}\nD. \\frac{1}{70}\n\nassistant:To find the probability that $abc = 180$ when three standard dice are tossed, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of possible outcomes when tossing three standard dice. Since each die has 6 sides, there are $6^3 = 216$ possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we find the number of outcomes where $abc$ does not equal 180. We can do this by considering the individual dice and finding the number of outcomes for each die that do not result in $abc = 180$.\n\nFor the first die, there are 5 numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) that do not result in $abc = 180$. Since there are 6 possible outcomes for the first die, there are $5 \\times 6 = 30$ outcomes where $abc$ does not equal 180 for the first die.\n\nSimilarly, for the second die, there are 5 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) that do not result in $abc = 180$. There are 6 possible outcomes for the second die, so there are $5 \\times 6 = 30$ outcomes where $abc$ does not equal 180 for the second die.\n\nFor the third die, there are 5 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) that do not result in $abc = 180$. There are 6 possible outcomes for the third die, so there are $5 \\times 6 = 30$ outcomes where $abc$ does not equal 180 for the third die.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of outcomes where $abc$ does not equal 180 is $30 + 30 + 30 = 90$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $abc = 180$ is $1 - \\frac{90}{216} = \\frac{126}{216} = \\frac{7}{12}$.\n\nNow, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives us $\\frac{7}{3\\cdot 12} = \\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the only option that matches is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$. Therefore, the probability that $abc = 180$ is $\\frac{1}{12}$.",
