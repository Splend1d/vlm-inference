In this scenario, the main character is telling a woman that she looks pretty in her new dress, which may be interpreted as being patronizing or objectifying. This behavior is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, the main character is simply tossing their trash in a trash can, which is an action that is not morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.",
