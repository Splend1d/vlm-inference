If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\n\nA. 1.00063\nB. 1.00032\nC. 1.00016\nD. 0.99968\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the index of refraction (n) and the wavelength (\u03bb) of light in a given medium. According to the equation:\n\nn = c / \u03bb\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nNow, let's consider the Michelson interferometer. When the gas cell is inserted, the number of fringes decreases. This means that the index of refraction of the gas is less than the original value. Let's denote the original index of refraction as R.\n\nThe relationship between the original number of fringes (N) and the index of refraction (R) can be expressed as:\n\nN = (100 - R) / R\n\nSince the gas cell is inserted and the number of fringes decreases, we can express this as:\n\n100 - R = (100 - R) / R\n\nNow we need to find the value of R. Rearranging the equation:\n\nR^2 - R - 100 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nR = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = -1, and c = -100.\n\nR = (1 \u00b1 \u221a((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-100))) / 2(1)\nR = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 400)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is positive, we can use the positive root:\n\nR = (1 + \u221a401) / 2\n\nR \u2248 1.00063\n\nNow we can find the index of refraction of the original gas:\n\nn = c / \u03bb\nn = (3 x 10^8) / 632.2\nn \u2248 0.99968\n\nTherefore, the index of refraction of the original gas is approximately 0.99968, which corresponds to option D.",
