It will be located above the equilibrium price.\n\nExplanation: A price ceiling is a maximum price that can be charged for a good or service. It is used to control the market and prevent prices from becoming too high. In this case, the equilibrium price is the price at which supply and demand are in balance. Because a price ceiling is above the equilibrium price, it will be located above the equilibrium price.",
