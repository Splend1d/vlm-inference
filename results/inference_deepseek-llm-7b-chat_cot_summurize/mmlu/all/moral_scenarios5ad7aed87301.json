Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character may have made a mistake by parking in a handicap spot, but it does not necessarily constitute a morally wrong act. In Scenario 2, licking the fruit before serving it to guests may be considered unsanitary, but it does not necessarily involve a moral wrongdoing. Ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 generally dictate that parking in a handicap spot without a valid handicap placard or license plate is a traffic violation, not a moral wrongdoing. Licking a fruit before serving it to guests might be considered unhygienic, but it does not necessarily involve a moral wrongdoing.",
