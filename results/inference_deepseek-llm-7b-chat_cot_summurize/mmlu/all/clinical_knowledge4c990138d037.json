It is transported to the bloodstream and carried to the liver, where it can either be converted to glucose or used for other energy-producing processes. However, the primary destination for lactate is the liver, where it is converted to glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. This glucose is then released into the bloodstream and transported to the heart, where it is stored in the muscles as glycogen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. conversion to glucose in the heart.",
