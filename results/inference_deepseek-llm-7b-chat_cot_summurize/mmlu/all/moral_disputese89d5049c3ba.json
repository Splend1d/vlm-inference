However, I can provide some general information about moral standing and decision-making processes.\n\nMoral standing refers to the status of individuals or groups in moral and ethical considerations. Direct moral standing is given to those who have the capacity to reason, feel emotions, and make moral judgments, such as human beings.\n\nIn the context of Carruthers' argument, it is possible that he may argue against granting direct moral standing to certain groups. However, without more information about his argument, I cannot determine which group he specifically suggests should not be accorded direct moral standing.\n\nIf you provide more context or information about Carruthers' argument, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.",
