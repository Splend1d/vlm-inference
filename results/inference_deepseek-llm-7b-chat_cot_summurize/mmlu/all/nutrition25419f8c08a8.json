It forms a stable radical that can be reduced back to active vitamin E by reaction with vitamin C\nB. It is converted to a stable radical by reaction with vitamin C\nC. It is lipid soluble and can react with free radicals in the bloodstream resulting from nitric oxide formation by vascular epithelium\nD. It forms a stable radical that can be reduced back to active vitamin E by reaction with glutathione and glutathione peroxidase\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. It is lipid soluble and can react with free radicals in the bloodstream resulting from nitric oxide formation by vascular epithelium.\n\nVitamin E is a lipid-soluble antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that can cause oxidative stress. One of the ways in which vitamin E exerts its antioxidant activity is by reacting with free radicals in the bloodstream. This occurs when nitric oxide (NO) is formed by the vascular epithelium (the lining of blood vessels). NO is a signaling molecule that helps regulate blood flow, but it can also produce free radicals when it reacts with oxygen.\n\nWhen vitamin E reacts with these free radicals, it forms a stable radical that can be reduced back to active vitamin E by reaction with vitamin C. This process helps to neutralize the damaging effects of the free radicals and prevent oxidative stress. Therefore, option C is the best explanation of the antioxidant action of vitamin E.",
