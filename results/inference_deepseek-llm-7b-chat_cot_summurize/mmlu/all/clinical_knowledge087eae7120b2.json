(Answer)\n\nAn ileostomy is a surgical procedure where a small intestine is connected to the skin's surface, creating a new opening called an ostomy. The ostomy opening should be flush with the skin to prevent any leakage or irritation. Option B, C, and D are incorrect because an ileostomy opening should not be longer or below the skin level.",
