What is the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle?\n\nA. \\frac{1}{20}\nB. \\frac{1}{32}\nC. \\frac{1}{12}\nD. \\frac{1}{16}\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the concept of spherical coordinates. Let's denote the points on the circle as A, B, and C. We can represent the position of each point as a triple (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), where r is the distance from the center of the circle to the point, \u03b8 is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the center to the point (measured counterclockwise), and \u03c6 is the angle between the positive z-axis and the line connecting the center to the point (measured counterclockwise). The relationship between the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) and the spherical coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is given by:\n\nx = r * sin(\u03b8) * cos(\u03c6)\ny = r * sin(\u03b8) * sin(\u03c6)\nz = r * cos(\u03b8)\n\nSince the points are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can assume that they are uniformly distributed. Therefore, the probability that the three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is equal to the probability that the spherical coordinates of the three points are all within the unit sphere.\n\nLet's denote the probability as P. We have:\n\nP = P(A) * P(B) * P(C)\n\nTo calculate P(A), P(B), and P(C), we can use the following expressions:\n\nP(A) = P(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\nP(B) = P(r, \u03b8 + \u03c0/2, \u03c6)\nP(C) = P(r, \u03b8, \u03c6 + \u03c0)\n\nSince the points are uniformly distributed, P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = 1/4.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the spherical coordinates of the three points are all within the unit sphere. We can do this by integrating over all possible values of r, \u03b8, and \u03c6:\n\nP = \u222b\u222b\u222b_0^1\u222b_0^2\u03c0\u222b_0^2\u03c0 r * sin(\u03b8) * cos(\u03c6) dr d\u03b8 d\u03c6\n\nThe limits for \u03b8 and \u03c6 are 0 to 2\u03c0 because the spherical coordinates are defined on the unit sphere. The limits for r are 0 to 1 because we are considering the points on the unit sphere.\n\nAfter calculating the integral, we get:\n\nP = 1/16\n\nSo, the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is 1/16.
