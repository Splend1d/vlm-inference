The velocity is the same on every point on the disk\nB. The part closer to the axis has a longer period\nC. The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk\nD. The part closer to the axis has a shorter period\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The velocity is the same on every point on the disk. This is because all points on a rotating disk experience the same tangential velocity, which is constant along the path of the rotation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the period of rotation is not related to the distance from the axis. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the disk to complete one full rotation, and it is determined by the radius of the disk and the angular velocity of rotation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the period of rotation is not the same on every point on the disk. The period of rotation is determined by the radius of the disk and the angular velocity of rotation, and it is not constant along the path of the rotation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the part closer to the axis has a longer period is not accurate. The part closer to the axis experiences a higher tangential velocity, which means it takes less time for that point to complete one full rotation. Therefore, the period of rotation is actually shorter for points closer to the axis.",
