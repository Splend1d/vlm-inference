The rectal examination is indicated for the assessment of some gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nThe rectal examination is a medical procedure used to assess the health of the rectum and anus. It can be used to detect abnormalities such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or cancer. While it is not typically used in a neurological examination, it can be helpful in diagnosing certain gastrointestinal disorders. If a patient refuses a chaperone, the doctor cannot override their decision, and the patient should be informed of their right to have a chaperone present during the examination.",
