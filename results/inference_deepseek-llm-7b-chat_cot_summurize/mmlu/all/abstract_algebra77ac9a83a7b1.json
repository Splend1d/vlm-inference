In this case, we can choose sqrt(2) as the generator.\n\nLet's express sqrt(2) as a sum of two elements from the field Q(sqrt(3), sqrt(18)):\nsqrt(2) = sqrt(2) + sqrt(18 - 2 * sqrt(3))\n\nNow, we need to find the degree of this extension. The degree is the highest power of sqrt(2) that can be expressed as a sum of two elements.\n\nWe can see that sqrt(18 - 2 * sqrt(3)) is a sum of two elements, so we can express sqrt(2) as a sum of two elements. Therefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 1, not 2.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 0.",
