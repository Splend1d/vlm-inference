The entire planets are not made mostly of metal. Planets are made of a variety of materials, including metal and non-metal elements.\n\nD. Radioactivity does occur in the core of a planet, but it is not the primary process responsible for creating metals. Instead, the radioactive decay of elements like uranium and thorium helps to heat the core, which in turn drives the processes of planet formation and evolution.",
