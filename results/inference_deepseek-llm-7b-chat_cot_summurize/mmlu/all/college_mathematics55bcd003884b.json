Statement 2 | There exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q.\n\nA. True, True\nB. True, False\nC. False, True\nD. False, False\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Suppose f : [a, b] is a function and suppose f has a local maximum. f'(x) must exist and equal 0?\n\nThis statement is false. A function f(x) has a local maximum at a point x, where f'(x) = 0. However, f'(x) can exist even if the function does not have a local maximum. For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2, which has a local maximum at x = 0. But f'(x) exists and equals 2x for all x in the domain.\n\nStatement 2: There exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q.\n\nThis statement is true. The set of all non-constant continuous functions from R to Q (the set of all rational numbers) is a dense subset of the set of all real numbers. This means that any open set in the set of real numbers can be covered by open sets from the set of rational numbers, which are the preimages of the open sets in the set of rational numbers under the continuous function.\n\nSo, the correct answers are:\n\nA. True, True\nB. True, False\nC. False, True\nD. False, False",
