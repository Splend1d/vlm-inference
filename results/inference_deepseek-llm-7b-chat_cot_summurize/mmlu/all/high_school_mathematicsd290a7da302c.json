So, if the half-life is 8 years, then after 8 years, only half of the substance will remain, and after 16 years, only one-fourth of the substance will remain, and so on.\n\nTo find out how long it will take for two-thirds of the substance to decay, we can set up the following equation:\n\nInitial substance * (1 - 2/3) = Final substance\n\nwhere Initial substance = 1 (since it's a whole substance), and Final substance = 1/3 (since two-thirds of the substance have decayed).\n\n1 * (1 - 2/3) = 1/3\n\nThis simplifies to 1/3 = 1/3, which is true. So, two-thirds of the substance will have decayed after the half-life of 8 years.\n\nA. 4.68\nB. 7.69\nC. 12.21\nD. 12.68",
