In terms of pressures within the venous and arterial compartments, this transfer results in\n\nA. no change in pressure in either compartment\nB. no effect on venous pressure and a small increase in arterial pressure\nC. an increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure\nD. little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. no effect on venous pressure and a small increase in arterial pressure.\n\nDuring the cardiac cycle, the heart pumps blood from the ventricles into the circulation. The stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped by the heart, is equal to the difference in blood volume between the atrial and ventricular end-diastolic volume. This difference in volume causes a pressure difference between the venous and arterial sides of the circulation, which drives the blood flow.\n\nAs the blood flows from the venous side to the arterial side, the venous pressure decreases and the arterial pressure increases. However, these changes are relatively small and do not have a significant impact on the overall pressures in the circulation. Therefore, the transfer of blood from the venous to the arterial side results in no change in pressure in either compartment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is a small increase in arterial pressure as a result of the blood flow. Option C is incorrect because it states that there is an increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure, which is not what happens during the cardiac cycle. Option D is incorrect because it states that there is a large increase in arterial pressure, which is not what happens during the cardiac cycle.",
