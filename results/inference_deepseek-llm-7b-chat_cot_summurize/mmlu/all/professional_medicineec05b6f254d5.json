She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits.

Radial nerve at the forearm\nD. Ulnar nerve at the elbow\n\nassistant:The most likely cause of the patient's numbness and tingling in the right hand is entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The symptoms described by the patient, such as tingling in the fingers and decreased sensation, are consistent with a compression or entrapment of the ulnar nerve. The patient's history of playing softball and her job as a cashier may also contribute to the development of this condition. The other options listed (median, musculocutaneous, and radial nerves) are not typically involved in entrapment at the locations described.",
