The statutory prohibition is a reasonable method of discrimination since the benefit to the public outweighs the injury or restrictions that would be inflicted upon the person.\nD. The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.\n\nassistant:The answer is D. The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.\n\nA bill of attainder is a legislative act that specifically condemns a person or group of people to punishment, such as fines or imprisonment, without a fair trial. In this case, the statute makes it a crime for a member of the Communist Party to act as an official of a labor union, and the union dismisses the Communist from his position after the senator's investigation. This is a clear example of a bill of attainder, as the statute specifically condemns the Communist to punishment by removing him from his position in the union. Therefore, the applicable rule of constitutional law is that the statutory provision is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.",
