This is because Stevenson identifies the meaning of a term with all the psychological causes and effects that attend its utterance. This means that Stevenson looks at the psychological factors that are connected with the term, such as the emotions and thoughts that are associated with it. This is different from options A and C, which involve empirical observations and the set of other words that are synonyms to the original word, respectively. Option D is not mentioned in the question and can therefore be excluded.",
