Given that f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x in the interval (-1, 4), we can rewrite the inequality as f'(x) + 1 \u2265 0, or f'(x) \u2265 -1.\n\nNow, we know that f(3) = 5, so we can find the slope of the tangent line at x = 3 by taking the derivative of f:\n\nf'(3) = 0 - (d/dx)(3^2) = 0 - 6 = -6.\n\nSince f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x in the interval (-1, 4), and we know that f'(3) = -6, the function f(x) must be decreasing in the interval (-1, 3).\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of f(x) in the interval (0, 4). Since f(x) is decreasing in the interval (-1, 3), we know that f(0) is greater than or equal to f(1), and greater than or equal to f(2). However, we cannot determine whether f(0) is greater than or equal to f(3), as we do not have enough information.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of f(0) is A. 3.",
