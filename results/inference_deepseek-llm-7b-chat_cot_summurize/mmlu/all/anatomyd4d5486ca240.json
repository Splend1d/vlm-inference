Adrenal gland\nB. Gallbladder\nC. Liver\nD. Pancreas\n\nassistant:The pancreas is an accessory organ of the gastrointestinal system that is responsible for secreting insulin. It is located in the abdomen, near the stomach and small intestine. The pancreas has two main functions: it helps to digest food and it regulates blood sugar levels. The pancreas produces hormones, including insulin, which helps the body use glucose (sugar) from the food we eat for energy. The other options listed (adrenal gland, gallbladder, and liver) are not accessory organs of the gastrointestinal system and are not responsible for secreting insulin.",
