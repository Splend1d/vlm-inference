Tell the physician that you can cover the remainder of the shift alone, so that he can sleep in his office. This is because it is important to prioritize patient safety, and allowing the physician to sleep in his office would be the least disruptive option and would not compromise patient care. Additionally, asking the physician to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration could potentially lead to legal and professional repercussions.",
