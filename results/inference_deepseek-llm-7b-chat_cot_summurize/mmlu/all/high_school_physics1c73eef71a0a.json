You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: How much current does a 60 W light bulb draw if it operates at a voltage of 120 V ?\n\nA. 0.25 A\nB. 0.5 A\nC. 2:00 AM\nD. 4:00 AM\n\nassistant:To calculate the current drawn by a light bulb, we can use the power formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) \\* Current (I)\n\nWe are given the power (P) as 60 W and the voltage (V) as 120 V. We need to find the current (I).\n\n60 W = 120 V \\* I\n\nNow, divide both sides of the equation by 120 V:\n\nI = 60 W / 120 V\n\nI = 0.5 A\n\nSo the light bulb draws 0.5 A of current. The correct answer is B. 0.5 A.",
