The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\n\nThis is because the students had a stronger intrinsic motivation to achieve high grades on quizzes, as it was a more significant reward for them. The variable-ratio schedule of stickers for showing up on time was not as strong a motivator for the students.",
