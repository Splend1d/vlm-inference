Medulla\nB. Cerebellum\nC. Cerebrum\nD. Pons\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Cerebrum.\n\nThe cerebrum is the largest and most complex part of the brain, and is responsible for a wide range of functions, including memory and learning. When there is a malfunction in the cerebrum, it can lead to memory loss or other cognitive problems. The other options listed (A. Medulla, B. Cerebellum, D. Pons) are all smaller, less complex parts of the brain that are not primarily involved in memory or learning.",
