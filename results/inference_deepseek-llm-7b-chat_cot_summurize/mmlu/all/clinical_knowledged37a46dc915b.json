The most common reason for stoma formation is cancer. Specifically, it is used as a treatment for patients with colorectal cancer.\n\nColorectal cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the large intestine (colon) or rectum. When colorectal cancer is detected, it may have already spread to other parts of the body. In this case, surgery may be necessary to remove the tumor and surrounding tissue, but it may also damage the rectum and colon, making it difficult to pass waste through the body.\n\nIn this case, a stoma is created to bypass the damaged area of the rectum and colon, allowing waste to be discharged outside the body through an opening in the abdominal wall. The stoma is usually temporary, but it can last for several months or even years, depending on the patient's condition.\n\nWhile irritable bowel syndrome and haemorrhoids can also cause stoma formation, these are less common reasons. Bladder instability is also not a common reason for stoma formation.\n\nIn conclusion, the most common reason for stoma formation is carcinoma, specifically colorectal cancer.",
