The preferred stock has a current market price of $96 a share. The firm's marginal tax rate (combined federal and state) is 40 percent, and the firm plans to maintain its current capital structure relationship into the future. The component cost of preferred stock to Lei-Feng, Inc. would be closest to .\n\nA. 6 percent\nB. 6.25 percent\nC. 10 percent\nD. 10.4 percent\n\nassistant:Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the dividend yield: The dividend paid by the preferred stock is $10 per share, and the market price is $96 per share. So, the dividend yield (D) can be calculated as:\n\nD = D/P = 10/96 \u2248 10.41%\n\n2. Calculate the dividend discount model (DDM) value: The dividend yield is the inverse of the DDM factor (DF), which can be calculated as:\n\nDF = 1/D = 96/10.41 \u2248 9.22%\n\n3. Calculate the required rate of return (RRR): Since the firm plans to maintain its current capital structure, the required rate of return on the preferred stock should be equal to the cost of equity (CE). Since the firm's marginal tax rate is 40%, the after-tax cost of equity can be calculated as:\n\nCE(t) = RRR(t) * (1 - t) = 0.4 * 0.922 \u2248 0.3688 \u2248 36.88%\n\n4. Calculate the component cost of preferred stock: Since the preferred stock has a current market price of $96 per share, and the required rate of return is 36.88%, we can calculate the component cost of preferred stock (CC) using the following formula:\n\nCC = P * (1 - DF) * (1 + RRR) = 96 * (1 - 0.922) * (1 + 0.3688) \u2248 10.4%\n\nThe component cost of preferred stock to Lei-Feng, Inc. would be closest to 10.4%. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 10.4 percent.",
