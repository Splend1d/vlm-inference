Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\nC. Assign number 0 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and number 1 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\nD. Assign numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n\nThe simulation should use a binomial distribution because the agent is successful in selling a policy to 20 percent of the customers he contacts. The binomial distribution is appropriate for this scenario because it models the number of successes (selling a policy) in a fixed number of trials (number of customers contacted).\n\nThe correct answer is A because it correctly assigns numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer. This corresponds to a binomial distribution with a success probability of 0.2 (20 percent) and a failure probability of 0.8 (80 percent).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not correctly assign numbers to the outcomes of the simulation. Option B assigns numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4 to failing to sell a policy to a customer, which does not correspond to a binomial distribution. Option C assigns numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and number 1 to failing to sell a policy to a customer, which does not correspond to a binomial distribution. Option D assigns numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer, which does not correspond to a binomial distribution.\n\nTherefore, the insurance agent should use option A to construct the simulation.",
