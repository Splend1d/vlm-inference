This means that they each own an undivided one-half interest in the property. The professor then executed a \"correction deed\" conveying the apartment building to his son and daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship. This means that they each own the entire property, with the right that if one of them dies, the survivor would inherit the deceased's share.\n\nSince the son died intestate, leaving the doctor as his sole heir, the property would pass to the doctor as the surviving joint tenant. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the daughter and the doctor as joint tenants with survivorship rights, subject to the professor's life estate.",
