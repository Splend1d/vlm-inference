The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.\n\nThe most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance is that the procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power. This is because the city council's rezoning action was not submitted to a referendum as required by the city's charter, which was amended by popular vote to require such a procedure. The real estate developer's subsequent application for \"recreational area\" approval was rejected by the city planning commission on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. This demonstrates that the referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious, and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.",
