False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.\nThis statement is true. If R is a commutative ring and M is an ideal of R, then the quotient ring R/M is a commutative ring. This is because the addition and multiplication operations in R/M are well-defined and satisfy the properties of a commutative ring.\n\nStatement 2: An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 in N.\nThis statement is false. An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if N = R. However, it is not necessarily true that 1 is in N if and only if N is all of R. The element 1 can be in N without N being all of R, for example when N is a proper ideal of R.",
