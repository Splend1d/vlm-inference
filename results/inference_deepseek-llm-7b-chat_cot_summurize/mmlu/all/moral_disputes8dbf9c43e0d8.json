She argues that treating someone as an object means treating them as a thing to be used or possessed, rather than as a person with dignity and worth. This can happen in various situations, such as in advertising or media, where women and men are portrayed in a sexualized manner, or in personal relationships, where one person is treated as an object of desire by another.\n\nNussbaum's approach to understanding sexual objectification is based on the idea that it is a form of violence against the person who is being treated as an object. This violence can take many forms, such as physical, psychological, and moral, and it can have long-lasting effects on the person being objectified.\n\nTherefore, according to Nussbaum, treating someone as an object is sufficient for sexual objectification. It is not necessary for sexual objectification, as there are many other ways in which someone can be objectified, such as through racism, ableism, or classism.",
