When interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive to borrow money, which can attract foreign investors. This increase in demand for the country's currency can lead to an appreciation of its value.\n\nGiven this information, if interest rates rise relatively more in country A than in country B, it implies that country A's interest rates are increasing faster than those in country B. This increased demand for country A's currency will likely lead to an appreciation of its value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The value of country A's currency will appreciate.",
