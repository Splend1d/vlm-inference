Demand creates its own supply. Say's law, also known as Say's principle, states that supply creates its own demand. It is an economic theory that argues that production creates its own demand and that production and trade are driven by the desire for profit, not by government intervention or other external factors. This principle was first proposed by the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say in the 19th century. According to Say, if production increases, it will create more demand for the goods produced, leading to increased economic growth and prosperity.",
