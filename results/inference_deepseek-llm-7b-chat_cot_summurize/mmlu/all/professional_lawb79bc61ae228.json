In this case, the pathway and pond would be considered inherently dangerous conditions because they could be attractive to children for recreational purposes.\n\nGiven this information, the plaintiff would likely recover under the \"attractive nuisance\" doctrine, as the woman failed to post any signs forbidding trespassing and the pathway and pond were regularly used by children without her consent. Therefore, the correct answer is A. recover, under the \"attractive nuisance\" doctrine.",
