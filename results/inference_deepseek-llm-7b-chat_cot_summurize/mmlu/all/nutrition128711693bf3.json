This is because:\n\n\nA. in the embryonic period the foetus is vulnerable to external factors in its environment\nB. the embryonic period often occurs before a woman knows she is pregnant\nC. interventions in late pregnancy may be too late to be effective\nD. all of the options given are correct\n\nassistant:All of the options given are correct. \n\nThe statement is true because:\n\nA. In the embryonic period, the foetus is indeed vulnerable to external factors in its environment. This is the time when the foetus is rapidly developing and undergoing critical changes, making it particularly sensitive to the mother's diet and overall health.\n\nB. The embryonic period often occurs before a woman knows she is pregnant. Therefore, if the mother does not have adequate nutrition during this time, it may affect the development of the foetus, leading to potential health issues in the future.\n\nC. Interventions in late pregnancy may be too late to be effective. Providing adequate nutrition during the pre-conception period can help ensure a healthy start for the developing foetus, which can potentially lead to a healthier pregnancy and a lower risk of complications.\n\nD. All of the options given are correct. This option reiterates the importance of adequate nutrition in the pre-conception period to support a successful pregnancy.",
