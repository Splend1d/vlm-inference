Review the internal auditor's reports to verify that the conclusions reached are consistent with the procedures performed.\n\nAn independent auditor should review the internal auditor's reports to verify that the conclusions reached are consistent with the procedures performed. This is because the internal auditor may have a conflict of interest and may not be objective in their assessment. The other options are not directly related to assessing an internal auditor's objectivity. Option A is related to testing controls, which is a part of the internal auditor's duties, but it is not directly related to assessing objectivity. Option B is related to risk factors that may lead to misstatements, but it does not specifically address objectivity. Option D is a policy that may affect an internal auditor's objectivity, but it is not a specific action that an independent auditor should take.",
