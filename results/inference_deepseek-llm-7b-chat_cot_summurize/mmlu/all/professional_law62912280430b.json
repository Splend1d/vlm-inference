The resident conveyed this tract \"to the people of the state in fee simple so long as said tract shall remain in its natural state (with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes). \"Under state law, conveyances of real property to \"the people\" of the state are deemed to vest title in the state regarded as a legal entity, and custody over such property resides in an appointed official known as the director of environmental resources.

This means that the state, as a legal entity, has custody over the property and the director of environmental resources has the authority to grant privileges related to the property.\n\nThe logging company was granted a privilege to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract, with incidental easements of way. This is an example of a profit-a-prendre, which is a legal concept that allows a person to take possession of property for their own use, without the permission of the owner.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. profit-a-prendre.",
