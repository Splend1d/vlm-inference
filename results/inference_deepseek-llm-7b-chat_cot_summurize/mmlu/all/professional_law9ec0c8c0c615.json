Therefore, the tenants should be able to compel Maximum to honor the leases at the lower rents.\n\nB and C are incorrect because Maximum had actual knowledge of Microhard's lease, not constructive notice. D is incorrect because the tenants should not need to renegotiate their leases, as they were valid and binding agreements.",
