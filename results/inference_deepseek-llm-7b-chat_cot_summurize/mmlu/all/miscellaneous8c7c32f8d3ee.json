An adult breathes in and out about 12 to 16 times per minute, and there are about 24 hours in a day. If we multiply the number of breaths per minute by the number of minutes in a day and the number of hours in a day, we get about 20,000 to 28,800 breaths per day. If we multiply each breath by the volume of the air in liters, we get an estimate of the volume of air an adult breathes in one day. So, 20,000 to 28,800 times 12 to 16 times 12 times 100, which is between 2,880,000 to 4,608,000 liters. So, 10,000 liters is the most reasonable estimate.",
