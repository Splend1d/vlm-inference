Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe city's decision to prohibit parking on the west side of the street was based on a coin flip, which is not a reasonable or fair method for making such a significant decision. This decision likely violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the government from treating similarly situated individuals differently without a legitimate reason.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment. This answer is incorrect because the plaintiff is not suing the city for its own wrongdoing, but rather for the unconstitutional action of the city council.\n\nB. No, because the city's action was reasonable. This answer is incorrect because the method used to make the decision, a coin flip, is not a reasonable or fair method for making such a significant decision.\n\nD. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decision-making processes by means of coin flips. This answer is partially correct, but it only addresses one aspect of the plaintiff's argument. The answer is more complete by addressing the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",
