Plasma\n\nassistant:The biggest and most dangerous changes in the cardiovascular system take place in the blood vessels.\n\nJustification:\nThe cardiovascular system is responsible for the circulation of blood throughout the body. Blood vessels are the network of blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body and back. They are exposed to various factors that can cause changes in their structure and function, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and inflammation. These changes can lead to atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of plaque in the blood vessels, making them narrower and harder for blood to flow through. This can cause a heart attack or stroke, which are considered to be the most dangerous changes in the cardiovascular system.",
