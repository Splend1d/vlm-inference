Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character is clearly morally wrong for intentionally creating potholes in a country road. This could potentially harm or inconvenience other people who use the road.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is working hard to achieve a good grade, which is generally not considered morally wrong. The focus is on personal achievement and improvement, which is a common goal for many people.",
