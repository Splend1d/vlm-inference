What fraction of the cube's volume floats above the surface of the fluid?\n\nA. 1.0/9\nB. 1.0/3\nC. 2.0/3\nD. 4.0/5\n\nassistant:Let's denote the density of the cube as $p$, the density of the fluid as $f$, and the side length of the cube as $s$. We are given that $p=100$ kg/m$^3$ and $f=1.2$ kg/m$^3$. We are asked to find the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface of the fluid.\n\nThe volume of the cube is $s^3$, and the volume of a small cube of side length $a$ floating in the fluid is $a^3$ when $a<s$. The fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface is given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{s^3 - a^3}{s^3} = \\frac{s^2}{s^3} = \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is less than $s$, we have $a^3 < s^3$, so the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $a$. We can use the Archimedean principle, which states that the buoyant force on a body submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. In this case, the buoyant force on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces, which is $pf$, or $100s$. The volume of the fluid displaced is $s^3$, so the weight of the fluid displaced is $100s$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$$\n100s = s^3\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $s$, we get:\n\n$$\n100 = s^2\n$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$\ns = 10\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{10}\n$$\n\nThe answer is: 1",
