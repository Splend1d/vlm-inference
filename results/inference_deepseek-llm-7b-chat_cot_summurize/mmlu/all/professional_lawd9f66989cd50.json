This is because her testimony is based on her own observations and experiences, and is not related to any technical or specialized knowledge. As a layperson, her testimony can be considered as a commonsense impression, and can be used to help the jury understand the situation and make a decision.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent: This option is incorrect because there is no evidence of a tacit admission by the grocery store.\n\nC. Inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy: This option is incorrect because the sister's testimony is relevant to the issue of whether the automatic doors were programmed to swing outward at the time of the accident.\n\nD. Inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations: This option is incorrect because there is no public policy that would prohibit the sister's testimony from being admitted.",
