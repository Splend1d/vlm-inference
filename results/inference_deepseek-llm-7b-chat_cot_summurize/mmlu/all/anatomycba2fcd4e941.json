This nerve supplies sensory information from the larynx to the brainstem, allowing the brain to initiate the cough reflex when necessary.\n\nThe external laryngeal nerve, on the other hand, is the efferent limb of the cough reflex, as it supplies motor fibers that control the muscles of the larynx and help to expel any foreign substances or excess mucus from the airway.\n\nThe internal laryngeal nerve is also known as the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and it plays a crucial role in the function of the larynx. It innervates the muscles of the larynx and the cricothyroid muscle, and also supplies sensory fibers to the larynx.\n\nFinally, the external laryngeal nerve, also known as the vagus nerve, is an important nerve that innervates a wide range of structures in the head and neck region, including the larynx. It provides sensory input from the larynx and also helps to regulate the function of the larynx through its motor fibers.",
