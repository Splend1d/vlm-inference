Scenario 1 | I plucked the rare flowers in the public garden. Scenario 2 | I broke his running record.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character plucked rare flowers in the public garden, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Plucking rare flowers can cause damage to the environment and harm the plants.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character broke someone's running record, which is not morally wrong in most situations. Breaking a record is not necessarily harmful or wrong, as long as it is done in a fair and respectful manner.\n\nTherefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 1, and not morally wrong in Scenario 2.",
