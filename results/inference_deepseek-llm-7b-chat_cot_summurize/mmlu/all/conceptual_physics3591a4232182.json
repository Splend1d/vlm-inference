The number of electrons this iron atom has is\n\nA. 52\nB. 26\nC. 24\nD. None.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to use the concept of atomic number and the periodic table.\n\nThe atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. For iron, the atomic number is 26. The number of electrons in an atom of an element is equal to the atomic number.\n\nTherefore, the iron atom in question has 26 electrons.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 26.",
