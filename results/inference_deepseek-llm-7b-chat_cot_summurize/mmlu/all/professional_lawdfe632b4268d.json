The testimony is\n\nA. admissible as not hearsay.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nD. admissible as then-existing state of mind.\n\nassistant:B. admissible as an admission.\n\nThe testimony that the defendant was committing a bank robbery in another state on the day that the victim was killed can be considered an admission against his own interest. This means that the defendant is admitting to committing the crime of bank robbery, which is a separate offense from the murder charge he is facing.\n\nAdmissions can be admissible in court as evidence if they are made voluntarily, by the accused person, and are relevant to the case at hand. In this case, the testimony is relevant because it may help to explain the defendant's state of mind on the day of the murder, and it could potentially be used to discredit his alibi.\n\nIt is important to note that the other options are not correct. Admissible as not hearsay refers to a statement that is not considered hearsay, but in this case, the testimony is hearsay. Admissible as a declaration against interest refers to a statement made by a person with a strong motive to lie, but the testimony is not made by the victim or a witness, so it does not qualify as a declaration against interest. Admissible as then-existing state of mind refers to a statement made by the accused that reveals his or her state of mind at the time of the crime, but the testimony is not made in the context of the crime, so it does not qualify as then-existing state of mind.",
