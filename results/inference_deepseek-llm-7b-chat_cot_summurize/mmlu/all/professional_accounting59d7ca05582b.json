Determine the beginning inventory\n2. Calculate the cost of the purchases made on 1/20 and 1/23\n3. Subtract the sales on 1/31 from the ending inventory\n4. Multiply the remaining inventory by the cost of goods sold (COGS)\n\nStep 1: Determine the beginning inventory\nBeginning inventory = 20000 units * $13 = $260,000\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cost of the purchases made on 1/20 and 1/23\nPurchase on 1/20: 30000 units * $15 = $450,000\nPurchase on 1/23: 40000 units * $17 = $680,000\n\nStep 3: Subtract the sales on 1/31 from the ending inventory\nSales on 1/31: 50000 units * $20 = $1,000,000\nEnding inventory = Beginning inventory + Purchases - Sales = $260,000 + $450,000 + $680,000 - $1,000,000 = $160,000\n\nStep 4: Multiply the remaining inventory by the cost of goods sold (COGS)\nCOGS = Beginning inventory + Purchases - Ending inventory = $260,000 + $450,000 + $680,000 - $160,000 = $930,000\n\nThe cost of goods sold for Ultra Co. in January is $930,000.
