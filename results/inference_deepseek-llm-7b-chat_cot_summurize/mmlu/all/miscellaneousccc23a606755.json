This means that the poverty line is adjusted annually to account for changes in the cost of living. The index value of government services such as Medicaid and public housing is not a definition of poverty, but rather a means of providing assistance to low-income individuals and families. The concept of relative deprivation and changes in the distribution of income are also related to poverty, but they are not the same thing. Poverty is defined as an absolute level, while relative deprivation is a measure of how people compare to one another in terms of their material conditions. Finally, lifestyle and the sliding scale based on individual needs are not considered official definitions of poverty by the U.S. government.",
