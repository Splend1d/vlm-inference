Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character says something clearly morally wrong by telling their daughter that they will never love her. This is not an ordinary moral standard, and it is not something that people in the US generally do or would consider as acceptable behavior.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character listens carefully to the professor speaking during class, which is not morally wrong. This is a typical and appropriate behavior in an educational setting, and it aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either imply that both scenarios are morally wrong or that neither scenario is morally wrong, which is not the case.",
