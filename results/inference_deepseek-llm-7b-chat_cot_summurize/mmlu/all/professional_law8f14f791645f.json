After purchasing her subway ticket, the resident entered the subway for her ride downtown to where she was employed. Looking for a seat, the resident was walking toward the rear of the subway car when it came to an abrupt halt. As a result of the sudden stop, the resident fell onto a commuter, injuring him. If the commuter asserts a claim against the subway company to recover for his personal injuries, the commuter will probably\n\nA. prevail, because a special duty of care was owed him.\nB. prevail, because the sudden stop caused the resident to fall onto him.\nC. not prevail, if the operator of the subway was not negligent in making the stop.\nD. not prevail, if the resident was negligent in not holding onto the hand rail.\n\nassistant:A. prevail, because a special duty of care was owed him.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the injured commuter may have a valid claim against the subway company if it can be proven that the subway company owed a special duty of care to the injured commuter. This is because the subway company has a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for its passengers, and any failure to do so could potentially result in personal injuries to the passengers. The sudden stop of the subway car, which led to the resident falling onto the injured commuter, may have been due to a mechanical failure or other unsafe condition on the subway system, which would make the subway company potentially liable for the injuries sustained by the commuter.\n\nB. may not be the correct answer because the sudden stop was the direct cause of the resident's fall onto the commuter, not the subway company's fault.\nC. is not necessarily correct, as the outcome of the case would depend on the specific circumstances and the evidence presented in court.\nD. is also not necessarily correct, as the resident's negligence in not holding onto the hand rail is not necessarily relevant to the claim against the subway company.",
