Both\nD. Neither\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I first need to understand the context and the differences between terrestrial radiation and solar radiation.\n\nTerrestrial radiation refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, while solar radiation is the radiation emitted by the Sun.\n\nComparing the two, I find that terrestrial radiation has a lower frequency than solar radiation. The Sun emits radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves, which have different frequencies, wavelengths, and energy levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. frequency",
