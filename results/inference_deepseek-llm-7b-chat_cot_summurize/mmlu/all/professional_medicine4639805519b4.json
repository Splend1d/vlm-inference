One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?\n\nA. Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1\nB. P-selectin\nC. Stromelysin\nD. Vascular endothelial growth factor\n\nassistant:The formation of the tissue in the wound on the woman's leg was most likely caused by increased activity of P-selectin. P-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule that is involved in the activation of blood clotting and the formation of inflammatory cells in response to tissue injury. It is released by endothelial cells and platelets in response to injury and helps to initiate the inflammatory response. The other options listed (Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1, Stromelysin, and Vascular endothelial growth factor) do not fit the description of the wound formation provided in the question.",
