While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant.

Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.\nC. No, because the confession was voluntary.\nD.

Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.\n\nThe defendant's motion to suppress the statement should be granted. The defendant's confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, and the informant's presence and protection motivated the defendant to confess. The defendant's admission of guilt was a result of the informant's actions, which can be considered coercive. Therefore, the confession should not be allowed to be used as evidence in the trial.",
