Theocratic\n\nassistant:Peter the Great's ruling style as described in the passage is best described as Absolutist. This is because the passage mentions that he returned determined to change his country and that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. It also mentions that he would try to lead, but if education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive, and if necessary, flog, the backward nation forward. These aspects indicate his belief in absolute power and his desire to control and transform his country without the need for checks and balances or shared power.",
