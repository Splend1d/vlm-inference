This is because Bacon emphasizes the importance of starting from sensory experiences and particulars (e.g., \"from the senses and particulars\") and gradually building up to more general axioms. This approach is in line with the principles of empiricism, which emphasize the importance of observation and experience in the formation of knowledge.\n\nEmpiricism is the idea that knowledge is derived from sensory experience and that the mind begins with a blank slate and builds up understanding through observation and experience. This approach contrasts with other philosophical traditions that emphasize rational deduction or the use of prior assumptions and principles in the formation of knowledge.\n\nBacon's method, as described in the passage, is based on the idea that the current system of logic is not effective in the discovery of new knowledge. Instead, he proposes a method that starts from sensory experiences and builds up to more general axioms, which he calls \"the true but unattempted way.\" This approach is consistent with the principles of empiricism, which emphasize the importance of observation and experience in the formation of knowledge.",
