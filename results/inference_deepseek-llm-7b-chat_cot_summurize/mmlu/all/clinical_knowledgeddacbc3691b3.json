Displaced apex beat; soft first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; short mid-diastolic murmur\nB.

Displaced apex beat; normal first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; long mid-diastolic murmur\nD. Tapping apex beat; loud first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; long mid-diastolic murmur\n\nassistant:The answer is A. Displaced apex beat; soft first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; short mid-diastolic murmur.\n\nA displaced apex beat is suggestive of mitral regurgitation (MR) because it is a common finding in MR. A soft first heart sound is also consistent with MR, as it is often heard in patients with this condition. A pan-systolic murmur is a classic finding in MR, and a short mid-diastolic murmur may be heard in some patients with MR.",
