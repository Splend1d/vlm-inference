Afferent arteriole\nB. Glomerulus\nC. Loop of Henle\nD. Renal pelvis\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Glomerulus.\n\nIn a nephron, the cluster of blood capillaries is called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is a network of small blood vessels that filter waste and excess substances from the blood. The other options are not clusters of blood capillaries:\n\nA. Afferent arteriole - This is a small artery that carries blood from the glomerulus to the rest of the nephron.\nC. Loop of Henle - This is a part of the nephron where blood is reabsorbed from the renal tubules.\nD. Renal pelvis - This is the funnel-shaped structure at the end of the nephron where urine is formed.",
