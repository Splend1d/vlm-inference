Cattle were first domesticated in sub-Saharan Africa about 8,500 years ago. This is supported by archaeological evidence, which shows that cattle were domesticated independently in several African regions around this time. The domestication of cattle is considered one of the most significant events in human history, as it allowed early humans to obtain a reliable source of food and resources.\n\nOption A is incorrect because archaeological evidence suggests that cattle were domesticated in sub-Saharan Africa before they were in western Europe. Option C is incorrect because cattle were not domesticated in North America until much later, around 4,000 years ago. Option D is incorrect because the Middle East is not the birthplace of cattle domestication.",
