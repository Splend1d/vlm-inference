Generative\nB. Neurotic\nC. Agreeable\nD. Certain\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Middle-aged adults appear to be more neurotic than older or younger adults. This is according to a study conducted by the University of California, which found that middle-aged adults are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues compared to other age groups. The study also found that middle-aged adults are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and have poor health habits. The researchers suggested that these findings may be due to the fact that middle-aged adults are often in a state of transition, both personally and professionally, and may be facing a range of challenges and stressors.",
