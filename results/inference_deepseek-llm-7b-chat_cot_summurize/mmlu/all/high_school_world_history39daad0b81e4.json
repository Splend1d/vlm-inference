It mentions that the Chamavi and Angrivarii drove out and exterminated the Bructeri, possibly due to hatred, plunder, or divine favor. The passage does not provide direct evidence to support any of the other options. Therefore, the most directly supported conclusion by the passage is option A: Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.",
