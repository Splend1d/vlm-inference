It is caused by Parkinson's Disease\n\nAn intention tremor is a type of involuntary shaking or trembling that occurs in response to an intended movement. It is typically worse when the affected limb is at rest or when it is actively moved towards a target. Intention tremors are commonly associated with Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder that affects movement. While cerebellar lesions can cause tremors, intention tremors are specifically associated with Parkinson's disease. Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects mathematical abilities, and while it can affect individuals in various ways, it is not specifically associated with intention tremors.",
