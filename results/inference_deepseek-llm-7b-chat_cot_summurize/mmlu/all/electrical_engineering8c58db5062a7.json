This principle is called\n\nA. virtually induced emf.\nB. dynamically induced emf.\nC. static induced emf.\nD. none of these\n\nassistant:The principle you are referring to is called \"dynamically induced emf\". In this context, the term \"dynamically\" refers to the fact that the field is varying, which creates a changing magnetic field. This changing magnetic field induces an electric field in the conductor, which can produce an emf.\n\nIn contrast, \"virtually induced emf\" is not a recognized term in the context of electromagnetic induction. \"Static induced emf\" would refer to an emf induced by a static (unchanging) magnetic field, which is not what you are describing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. dynamically induced emf.",
