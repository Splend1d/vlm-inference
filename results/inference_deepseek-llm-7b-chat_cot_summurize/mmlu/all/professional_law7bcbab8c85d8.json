Since the deed was properly executed and recorded, it is legally binding, and the property is now owned by the boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the co-worker is not a joint tenant with the boyfriend and the student. Option C is incorrect because the co-worker and the student are not joint tenants, but rather tenants in common. Option D is incorrect because the co-worker is not the owner in fee simple, but rather the buyer of the property from the boyfriend.",
