The doctor should be entitled to recover money damages from the veterinarian.\nC. The veterinarian should be required to supply water to the doctor.\nD. There is no remedy.\n\nassistant:The appropriate action by the doctor against the veterinarian involves an analysis of the legal restrictions and covenants in the deeds of the 11 lots sold. According to the deed restrictions, the property should not be used for any purpose other than a single-family residence. The doctor's well, which is a part of her residence, is supplying water to all the owners of the 11 lots, which is consistent with the intended use of the properties.\n\nHowever, the veterinarian's well is causing water to be diverted from the doctor's well, and as a result, the doctor is no longer able to use her well for its intended purpose. This situation may violate the express covenant and condition in the deeds of the 11 lots sold, which prohibits the use of the properties for any purpose other than a single-family residence.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate remedy in this case is an injunction against the veterinarian. An injunction should be decreed enjoining the veterinarian from using her well, as it violates the express covenant and condition in the deeds of the 11 lots sold.\n\nThus, the answer is A. An injunction should be decreed enjoining the veterinarian from using her well.",
