What is the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase?\n\nA. $1 \nB. $1.25 \nC. $1.75 \nD. $4\n\nassistant:To calculate the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase, we need to consider the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect is the total increase in GDP for each unit of initial expenditure.\n\nFirst, let's assume Mr. Woods spends his $1 on a golf ball in England. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of an additional dollar that is spent on final goods and services. In this case, the MPC is 0.75.\n\nMPC = 0.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the initial increase in GDP:\n\nInitial increase in GDP = Initial expenditure x MPC\nInitial increase in GDP = $1 x 0.75\nInitial increase in GDP = $0.75\n\nNext, we need to consider the multiplier effect. The multiplier is a measure of the total increase in GDP for each unit of initial expenditure. The multiplier can vary depending on the specific assumptions and economic context.\n\nIn this case, we can assume a multiplier of 2. This means that for each $1 spent on an initial expenditure, there is a $2 increase in GDP.\n\nTotal increase in GDP = Initial increase in GDP x Multiplier\nTotal increase in GDP = $0.75 x 2\nTotal increase in GDP = $1.50\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase is $1.25.",
