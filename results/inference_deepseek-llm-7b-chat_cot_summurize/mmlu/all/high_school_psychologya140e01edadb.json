Her failure to fold up her jeans and sweater to use as a pillow-substitute best illustrates the effects of\n\nA. the availability heuristic\nB. functional fixedness\nC. confirmation bias\nD. the representativeness heuristic\n\nassistant:The best answer is B. functional fixedness. This is a cognitive bias where an object is limited to only one specific function, making it difficult to see alternative uses for the object. In this case, Shannon's jeans and sweater were limited to only being worn, and she couldn't think of them as potential pillows due to this bias.",
