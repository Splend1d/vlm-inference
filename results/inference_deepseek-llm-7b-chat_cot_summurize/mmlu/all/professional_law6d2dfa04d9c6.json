When the investor's title search revealed the above language in the grantee section of the deed to the woman, the investor refused to close the transaction. The contract was silent as to the woman's title obligation. The woman has sued the investor for specific performance. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n\nassistant:The investor is likely to prevail in this situation. The language in the grantee section of the deed stipulates that the grantee (in this case, the woman) may not transfer any interest in the land for 10 years from the date of the instrument. Since the woman contracted to sell the land to the investor two years after acquiring the land, she is in violation of the 10-year restriction on transfer. The investor's title search revealed this restriction, and as a result, the investor has grounds to refuse to close the transaction.\n\nThe fact that the woman's heirs did not join in the contract does not necessarily impact the outcome in this case, as the investor's refusal to close the transaction is based on the woman's violation of the deed's restriction on transfer, which is not affected by her heirs' involvement in the contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.",
