The double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution protects individuals from being prosecuted again for the same offense. In this case, the defendant was previously charged and had the heroin possession charge dismissed at the preliminary hearing. Therefore, any subsequent grand jury indictment for heroin possession would be a violation of the double jeopardy clause.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. granted.",
