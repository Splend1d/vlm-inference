The Dow-Jones average is not a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, so the binomial distribution is not appropriate.\nB. The weather is not a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, so the binomial distribution is not appropriate.\nC. The number of drivers wearing seat belts is a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (each driver is either wearing a seat belt or not), so the binomial distribution is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.
