Yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet.\n\nassistant:The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. To determine whether the search of the closet should be suppressed, we must consider whether the officers had probable cause to search the house and whether they had a warrant.\n\n1. Probable cause: The officers had probable cause to arrest the man for armed bank robberies. However, they did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet. Therefore, the search of the closet was not supported by probable cause.\n\n2. Warrant: The officers did have a valid arrest warrant, which authorizes them to enter the man's house to arrest him. However, the warrant does not grant them permission to search the house.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is D. Yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet.",
