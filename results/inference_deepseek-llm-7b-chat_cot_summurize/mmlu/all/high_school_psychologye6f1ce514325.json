Experiments typically involve more participants than other research methods do.\nD. Experiments take place in more realistic, real-life settings.\n\nassistant:B. Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\n\nExperiments are able to determine causal relationships because they are able to isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables. In an experiment, researchers are able to manipulate one or more independent variables and observe how they affect the dependent variable. This allows them to determine whether the independent variable has a causal effect on the dependent variable.\n\nA. While experiments can be more precise than other research methods, this is not the primary reason why they are able to determine causal relationships.\nC. The number of participants in an experiment is not necessarily related to its ability to determine causal relationships.\nD. The setting of an experiment is not necessarily more realistic or real-life than other research methods, and it is not the primary reason why experiments are able to determine causal relationships.",
