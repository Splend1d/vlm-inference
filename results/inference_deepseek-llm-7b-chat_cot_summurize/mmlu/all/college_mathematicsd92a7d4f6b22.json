This set has the same cardinality as the set of all natural numbers (Z). The cardinality of R is the same as the cardinality of Z.\n\nB. The set of all functions from Z to Z: This set is the set of all possible functions from the set of all natural numbers (Z) to itself. The cardinality of this set is the same as the cardinality of the Cartesian product of the set of all natural numbers with itself, which is 2^n, where n is the number of natural numbers. In this case, n is infinite, so the cardinality of this set is 2^\u221e, which is equal to 2.\n\nC. The set of all functions from R to {0, 1}: This set is the set of all possible functions from the set of all real numbers (R) to the set of two elements, {0, 1}. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the Cartesian product of the set of all real numbers with the set of two elements, which is 2^\u221e. Since 2^\u221e is infinite, the cardinality of this set is also infinite.\n\nD. The set of all finite subsets of R: This set is the set of all possible finite subsets of the set of all real numbers (R). The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the set of all possible finite subsets of R. Since the cardinality of R is infinite, the cardinality of this set is also infinite.\n\nComparing the cardinalities of the sets, we can see that the set of all functions from Z to Z has the greatest cardinality.",
