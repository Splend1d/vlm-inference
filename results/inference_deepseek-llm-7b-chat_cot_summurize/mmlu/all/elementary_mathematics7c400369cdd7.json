This means that Bus A will leave at the same time as Bus B after 375 minutes.\n\nTo convert 375 minutes to hours and minutes:\n- 375 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 R 30 minutes\n\nThis means that Bus A will leave at the same time as Bus B at 6:00 a.m. + 30 minutes, which is 7:30 a.m.\n\nTherefore, the next time Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time is option C.",
