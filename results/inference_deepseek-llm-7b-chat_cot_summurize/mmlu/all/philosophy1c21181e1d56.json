This means that the obligation to prioritize one's children's welfare is relative to the desires and goals of the individual making the decision. In other words, if the individual values the welfare of their children more than other goals, they may be obligated to prioritize their children's welfare over other things. However, if the individual values other goals more, they may not be obligated to prioritize their children's welfare. This view is in contrast to agent-neutral theories, which hold that there is a single, objective moral obligation to prioritize the welfare of children.",
