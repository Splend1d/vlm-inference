This requirement infringes on the state's sovereignty and violates the Tenth Amendment, which prohibits the federal government from passing laws that would infringe on the powers reserved to the states. Therefore, the state has valid grounds to challenge the constitutionality of the federal statute.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the sale of alcoholic beverages may have an impact on interstate commerce, but it is not the only reason the statute would be held valid. Answer B is incorrect because the establishment of a state watchdog agency under the auspices of a federal regulatory scheme does not necessarily make the statute consistent with the provisions of the Twenty First Amendment. Answer C is incorrect because the federal statute does not violate the principles of state sovereignty embodied by the Eleventh Amendment.",
