Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n\nassistant:Voltaire is best known for supporting the demand for religious toleration, which corresponds to option D. This is evident in the quote provided, where he criticizes the idea that some people are persecuted and oppressed due to their religious beliefs, while others are allowed to persecute and oppress others for their beliefs. He suggests that such actions are \"a wretched gamble is the game of human life,\" and that the Lisbon earthquake serves as a reminder of the fragility and vulnerability of human life. He also implies that the earth is indifferent to human suffering and that the Inquisition, which is an institution that is often associated with religious persecution, may not be immune to the destruction caused by natural disasters. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",
