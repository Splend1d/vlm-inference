Yes, with p=2.\nB. Yes, with p=3.\nC. Yes, with p=5.\nD. No.\n\nassistant:The Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility states that a polynomial g(x) in Z[x] is irreducible over Q if and only if g(x) satisfies one of the following conditions:\n\n1. g(x) is a square in Q[x],\n2. g(x) has a root in Q[x] with the property that its minimal polynomial over Q has no other roots in Q[x],\n3. g(x) is a product of two monic irreducible polynomials in Z[x] of degrees \u2265 3.\n\nLet's apply the Eisenstein criterion to the given polynomial g(x) = x^2 - 12.\n\n1. g(x) is a square in Q[x]: Since g(x) = x^2 - 12, it is not a square in Q[x]. So, this condition is not satisfied.\n\n2. g(x) has a root in Q[x] with the property that its minimal polynomial over Q has no other roots in Q[x]: To determine if this condition is satisfied, we need to factor the polynomial g(x) = x^2 - 12. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to find that the only rational root of g(x) is 6. So, we can factor g(x) as:\n\ng(x) = (x - 6)(x - 2) = x^2 - 4x - 12.\n\nNow, we can see that g(x) does not have any roots in Q[x] with the property that its minimal polynomial over Q has no other roots in Q[x]. So, this condition is not satisfied.\n\n3. g(x) is a product of two monic irreducible polynomials in Z[x] of degrees \u2265 3: We can factor g(x) as a product of two monic irreducible polynomials in Z[x] of degrees \u2265 3, which is impossible. So, this condition is not satisfied either.\n\nSince none of the conditions for the Eisenstein criterion are satisfied, the polynomial g(x) = x^2 - 12 is reducible over Q.",
