Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder.

The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week.

The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n\nassistant:The legal rights of the parties in this case are not entirely clear, but let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\nThis option is incorrect. The June 3 memo did not serve as an integration of their agreement because it was a communication about a separate discount, not an integration of all the terms of the contract.\n\nB. The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\nThis option is also incorrect. The company's representative agreed to supply the propane tanks at $50 per tank, but it is not clear that this agreement included a 10 percent discount. The owner assumed the discount, but the company did not object, so it is not clear if the contract included this discount.\n\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\nThis option is incorrect. The contract price was not $50,000, because the owner's June 3 memo did not materially alter the company's offer. The company's offer was for $50 per tank, and the owner assumed a 10 percent discount, but the company did not object to this assumption.\n\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\nThis option is correct. The company did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained in its offer, so the owner was free to assume the 10 percent discount in his June 3 memo. The company agreed to supply 1,000 propane tanks at $50 per tank, and the owner agreed to pay $45,000 for them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.",
