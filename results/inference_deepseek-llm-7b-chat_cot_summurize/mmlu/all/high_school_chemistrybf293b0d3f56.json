If 0.435 g of precipitate was obtained, what is the percentage of chlorine in the sample?\n\nA. 10.80%\nB. 4.60%\nC. 43.50%\nD. 18%\n\nassistant:To find the percentage of chlorine in the sample, we can use the following equation:\n\n(molar mass of Cl^-) * (mass of precipitate) / (mass of sample) * 100\n\nFirst, we need to find the molar mass of Cl^- (chloride ions). The molar mass of AgCl (silver chloride) is 171.86 g/mol. Since 0.435 g of AgCl was obtained, we can find the number of moles of AgCl:\n\nmoles of AgCl = (mass of precipitate) / (molar mass of AgCl)\nmoles of AgCl = 0.435 g / 171.86 g/mol\nmoles of AgCl = 0.025 mol\n\nNow, we can find the number of moles of Cl^-:\n\nmoles of Cl^- = moles of AgCl * 1\nmoles of Cl^- = 0.025 mol\n\nNext, we need to find the molar mass of Cl^-:\n\nmolar mass of Cl^- = molar mass of Cl^- * 1\nmolar mass of Cl^- = 35.45 g/mol\n\nNow, we can find the mass of Cl^- in the sample:\n\nmass of Cl^- = (molar mass of Cl^-) * (moles of Cl^-)\nmass of Cl^- = 35.45 g/mol * 0.025 mol\nmass of Cl^- = 0.88625 g\n\nFinally, we can find the percentage of chlorine in the sample:\n\npercentage of chlorine = (mass of Cl^-) / (mass of sample) * 100\npercentage of chlorine = 0.88625 g / (2.35 g + 0.88625 g) * 100\npercentage of chlorine = 0.35087 * 100\npercentage of chlorine = 35.087 %\n\nThe closest answer to this percentage is B. 4.60%.",
