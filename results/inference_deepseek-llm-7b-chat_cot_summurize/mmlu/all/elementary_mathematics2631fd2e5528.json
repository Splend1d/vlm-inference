In which number is the value of the digit 6 exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote?\n\nA. 681,452\nB. 462,017\nC. 246,412\nD. 125,655\n\nassistant:To find the number where the digit 6 is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the number by 10,000. This will remove the trailing 0's after the digit 6.\n2. Divide the number by 100 to find the position of the digit 6.\n3. Multiply the position by 10 to find the value of the digit 6.\n4. Compare the value of the digit 6 in the original number to the value we found in step 3.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. 186,425 / 10,000 = 1864.25\n2. 1864.25 / 100 = 1864.25\n3. 1864.25 * 10 = 18,642.5\n4. The digit 6 in the original number is 4, while the value of the digit 6 we found in step 3 is 18,642.5.\n\nSince the value of the digit 6 in the original number is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote, we need to try the other options.\n\n5. 681,452 / 10,000 = 681.452\n6. 681.452 / 100 = 68.1452\n7. 68.1452 * 10 = 681.452\n8. The digit 6 in the original number is 4, while the value of the digit 6 we found in step 7 is 681.452.\n\nSince the value of the digit 6 in the original number is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote, we need to try the other options.\n\n9. 462,017 / 10,000 = 462.017\n10. 462.017 / 100 = 46.2017\n11. 46.2017 * 10 = 462.017\n12. The digit 6 in the original number is 4, while the value of the digit 6 we found in step 11 is 462.017.\n\nSince the value of the digit 6 in the original number is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote, we need to try the other options.\n\n13. 246,412 / 10,000 = 246.412\n14. 246.412 / 100 = 246.412\n15. 246.412 * 10 = 2464.12\n16. The digit 6 in the original number is 4, while the value of the digit 6 we found in step 15 is 2464.12.\n\nSince the value of the digit 6 in the original number is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote, we need to try the other options.\n\n17. 125,655 / 10,000 = 125.655\n18. 125.655 / 100 = 125.655\n19. 125.655 * 10 = 1256.55\n20. The digit 6 in the original number is 4, while the value of the digit 6 we found in step 19 is 1256.55.\n\nSince the value of the digit 6 in the original number is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote, we need to try the other options.\n\n21. 125,655 / 10,000 = 125.655\n22. 125.655 / 100 = 125.655\n23. 125.655 * 10 = 125",
