Neighbors\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first identify the most likely answer choices and then analyze each option in the context of elder abuse.\n\n1. Spouse: Elder abuse is often committed by family members, but it is not exclusively perpetrated by spouses.\n2. Children: While some cases of elder abuse involve children, it is not the most frequent source of elder abuse.\n3. Grandchildren: Similar to children, while some cases of elder abuse involve grandchildren, it is not the most frequent source of elder abuse.\n4. Neighbors: Neighbors are unlikely to be the primary source of elder abuse, as they usually have limited contact with the older adult.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is \"B. Children.\"",
