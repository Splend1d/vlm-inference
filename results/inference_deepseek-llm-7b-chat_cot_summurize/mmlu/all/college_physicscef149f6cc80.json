How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\n\nA. 80 s\nB. 160 s\nC. 2,000 s\nD. 5,000 s\n\nassistant:To find the decay rate of the radioactive isotope, we can use the least squares method to fit a straight line to the data. The slope of the line represents the decay rate.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of the data and the standard deviation:\n\nMean = (3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 10 = 23 / 10 = 2.3\n\nNext, we can calculate the standard deviation:\n\nstd_dev = sqrt(sum((x - mean)\u00b2 / (n - 1)) / (n - 1)) = sqrt(sum((x - 2.3)\u00b2 / 9) / 9) = sqrt(0.04) \u2248 0.2\n\nNow, we can find the uncertainty in the decay rate, which is 1 percent of the mean decay rate:\n\nUncertainty = (0.01)(2.3) = 0.023\n\nFinally, we can find the number of seconds the student should count to obtain the decay rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent:\n\nt = (2.3 - decay_rate) / decay_rate\n\nSolving for decay_rate:\n\ndecay_rate = 2.3 / t\n\nSubstituting the uncertainty into the equation:\n\n(2.3 - decay_rate) / decay_rate = (2.3 - 2.3(0.023)) / 0.023 \u2248 400 / 0.023 \u2248 1761.9\n\nt = 1761.9 / 2.3 \u2248 750 s\n\nTherefore, the student should count for approximately 750 seconds to establish the decay rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent. The closest option to this value is B. 160 s.",
