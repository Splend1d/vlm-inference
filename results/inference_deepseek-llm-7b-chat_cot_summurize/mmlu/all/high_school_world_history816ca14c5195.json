The jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit.\nD. Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth.\n\nassistant:The passage discusses the copper and gold mines in the kingdom of a sultan named Musa. It mentions that the kingdom does not levy duties except on crude copper and that the kingdom sends the copper to pagan Sudan and sells it for two-thirds of its weight in gold. The passage also mentions that there are pagan nations in the kingdom that the sultan does not collect tribute from, but whom he employs in extracting gold from its deposits.\n\nOption A, that Mali was able to forge advanced bronze tools from its mineral resources, is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention anything about bronze tools or the forging of tools from the mineral resources.\n\nOption B, that international trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources, is supported by the passage. The passage mentions that the kingdom sends the copper to pagan Sudan and sells it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, which implies that there was international trade involving the exchange of mineral resources.\n\nOption C, that the jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit, is not directly supported by the passage. The passage mentions that the sultan does not collect tribute from certain pagan nations but employs them in extracting gold, but it does not explicitly state that the jizya could only be collected on unbelievers who had minerals to exploit.\n\nOption D, that Mali's relatively advanced mining technologies accounted for its mineral wealth, is not directly supported by the passage. The passage does not provide any information about the mining technologies used in the kingdom.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the most supported inference is option B, that international trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources.",
