The man sued the restaurant for negligence and damages. At trial, the man's attorney calls a witness to testify that the witness also suffered frostbite when she spilled a soft drink in her lap that she had purchased at the restaurant two weeks earlier. The witness also states that she told the restaurant about her injury immediately after suffering it. Upon objection by the restaurant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the witness's testimony\n\nA. admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence, provided that the court gives a cautionary instruction that the testimony should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages.\nB. admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger of frostbite posed by its soft drinks.\nC. inadmissible, because it is not probative of a fact in issue.\nD. inadmissible, because it seeks to put into evidence separate, unrelated transactions with a third party.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C.\n\nThe witness's testimony is not probative of a fact in issue. The issue in the case is whether the restaurant was negligent in causing the man's frostbite, and whether the man suffered damages as a result. The witness's testimony about her own injury is not relevant to these issues.\n\nThe witness's testimony is also not admissible for any other reason specified in the rules of evidence. It does not prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger of frostbite posed by its soft drinks, as the danger of the soft drink causing frostbite is not in dispute.\n\nThe witness's testimony is not admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence, as the court should give a cautionary instruction that the testimony should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages.\n\nFinally, the witness's testimony is not admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence because it is not relevant to the issue of damages. The issue of damages is whether the man suffered damages as a result of the restaurant's negligence, and the witness's testimony does not address this issue.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should rule the witness's testimony inadmissible.",
