The President has the authority to issue executive orders to direct the actions of federal employees, including those under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in order to provide emergency aid in a foreign country. The fact that the member of the federal agency's job responsibilities do not include international relief efforts does not invalidate the executive order, as the President has the authority to direct federal employees to perform actions necessary to fulfill the duties of their office.",
