This modification prevents the substrate from binding to the active site, effectively inhibiting the enzyme's catalytic activity. This type of inhibition is known as competitive inhibition because the inhibitor is competing with the substrate for the same binding site on the enzyme.\n\nA competitive inhibitor does not form covalent links with the enzyme, as this would be irreversible and would permanently alter the enzyme's structure. Similarly, a competitive inhibitor does not decrease the number of enzyme molecules available to bind substrates, as this would be reversible and would not necessarily inhibit the enzyme's activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. irreversibly modifying some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site.",
