TRUE\nC. FALSE\nD. beyond question\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. contrary to his religion.\n\nDescartes' discovery that many of the alleged truths learned in his youth were contrary to his religion refers to his famous \"dream argument,\" which he used to argue against the possibility of an evil demon deceiving him into believing that the external world exists. Descartes reasoned that if an evil demon were able to deceive him into believing that the external world did not exist, then he could not trust his senses or any other means of knowledge. However, he reasoned that the evil demon could not deceive him into believing that he was dreaming, because if he were dreaming, then he would not be able to doubt that he was dreaming. Therefore, if he was dreaming, then the external world must exist, and if he was not dreaming, then the external world must also exist.",
