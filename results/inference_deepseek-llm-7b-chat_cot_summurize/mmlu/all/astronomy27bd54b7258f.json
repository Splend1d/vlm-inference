To properly account for the varying distances of the planets from Earth.\n\nassistant:A. Ptolemy used the concept of 'circles upon circles' in his model of the universe to explain why more distant planets took longer to complete a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac. This was due to the relative distances between Earth and the planets, as well as the varying speeds at which the planets traveled.",
