Analyze the given number pattern: 5, 20, 35, 50, 65...\n   a. Identify the common difference between consecutive numbers.\n   b. Use this common difference to find the next number in the pattern.\n\n2. Given that the common difference is 15, find the next number in the pattern:\n   a. 5 + 15 = 20\n   b. 20 + 15 = 35\n   c. 35 + 15 = 50\n   d. 50 + 15 = 65\n\n3. Analyze the options provided and find the pattern that matches the given number pattern:\n   A. 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...\n      a. The common difference between consecutive numbers is 5.\n      b.
