Z_11: The order of Z_11 is 11, as 11 is the smallest positive integer n such that 11n = 0 (mod 11).\n2. Z_15: The order of Z_15 is 15, as 15 is the smallest positive integer n such that 15n = 0 (mod 15).\n\nNow, let's find the order of the factor group:\n\nOrder of (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) = (11 * 15) / 1 = 165 / 1 = 165\n\nNone of the given options A, B, C, or D match the result, which is 165.",
