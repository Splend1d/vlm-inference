Obtain an understanding of any specialized financial reporting frameworks and practices used in the entity's industry.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Perform preliminary analytical procedures to identify accounts that may represent specific risks relevant to the engagement.\n\nExplanation: According to the AICPA's auditing standards, an accountant is required to perform analytical procedures to identify accounts that may represent specific risks relevant to the engagement. These risks may include accounts with unusual balances, significant changes in account balances, or accounts that have been identified as high-risk during the risk assessment process.\n\nA. This answer is incorrect because verifying that the financial information supplied by the entity agrees with the books of original entry is not a required step before compiling financial statements of a nonissuer.\n\nC. Making inquiries of management concerning the entity's procedures used in adjusting and closing the books of account is not a required step before compiling financial statements of a nonissuer.\n\nD. Obtaining an understanding of any specialized financial reporting frameworks and practices used in the entity's industry is not a required step before compiling financial statements of a nonissuer.",
