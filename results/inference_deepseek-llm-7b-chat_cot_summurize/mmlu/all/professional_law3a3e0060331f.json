Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.\n\nassistant:The information in the plaintiff's diary is admissible because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection. Answer A is correct. In this case, the plaintiff's attorney sought to refresh her recollection with the diary, but it did not have any effect on her memory. Therefore, the information in the diary can still be admitted at trial as long as it meets the requirements for admission, such as relevance and reliability. The plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit. The defendant's objection to the admissibility of the diary would only be valid if the diary was not prepared in the regular course of the plaintiff's business or profession, or if it was not offered for an appropriate purpose.",
