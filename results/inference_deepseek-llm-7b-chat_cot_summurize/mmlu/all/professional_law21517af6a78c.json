The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.\n\nassistant:The strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute would be that the funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest. This is because the statute provides a public subsidy to hospitals for each cancer patient who was admitted for more than one week, but with a condition that it will not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. This condition does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right, but is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest, which is to improve the health care of cancer patients by providing public funds to assist privately owned hospitals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.",
