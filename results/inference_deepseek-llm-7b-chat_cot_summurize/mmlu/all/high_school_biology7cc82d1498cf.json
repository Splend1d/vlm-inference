DNA polymerase and DNA ligase carry out excision repair before transcription.\nD. RNA processing will repair point mutations before mRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nassistant:B. Several codons code for the same amino acid.\n\nA point mutation occurs when a single base pair in the DNA sequence is changed, leading to a change in the corresponding amino acid in the protein. However, if several codons code for the same amino acid, then a point mutation in any of those codons will still result in the same amino acid being encoded in the protein. This is because the reading frame of the gene is unchanged, and the protein sequence remains the same. Therefore, a point mutation in any of these codons will have no negative impact on the protein formed.",
