Since the driver of the truck is found to be 20% at fault, the driver of the car should recover 80% of the judgment against the motorcyclist. Therefore, the driver of the car should recover $45,000 * 0.8 = $36,000.\n\nSince the driver of the car recovered $36,000 from the motorcyclist, he is not entitled to recover any additional amount from the driver of the truck. Therefore, the correct answer is D. recover $15,000.",
