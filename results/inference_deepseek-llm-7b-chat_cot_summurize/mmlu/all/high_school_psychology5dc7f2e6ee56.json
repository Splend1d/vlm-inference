The Barnum effect refers to the tendency for people to interpret vague, general statements as personal and specific, leading them to believe that the statements apply to them. In the context of learned helplessness, this tendency can contribute to the development of the state of mind by reinforcing the perception that an individual is unable to influence events or outcomes.",
