You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A zoo has 15 toucans and 60 parrots. What is the ratio of the number of toucans to the number of parrots at the zoo?\n\nA. 1:04\nB. 1:05\nC. 4:01\nD. 4:05\n\nassistant:To find the ratio, we divide the number of toucans by the number of parrots.\n\n15 toucans / 60 parrots = 0.25\n\nNow, we can convert this decimal to a fraction:\n\n15 toucans / 60 parrots = 15/60\n\nWe can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:\n\n15/60 = 1/4\n\nFinally, we can convert the fraction back to a ratio by writing it as a colon:\n\n1 toucan : 4 parrots\n\nSo, the ratio of the number of toucans to the number of parrots at the zoo is 1:4, which corresponds to answer C. 4:01.",
