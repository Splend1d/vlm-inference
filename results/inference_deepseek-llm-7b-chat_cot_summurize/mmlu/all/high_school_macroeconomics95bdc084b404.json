Lower interest rates that result from borrowing to conduct expansionary monetary policy\nB. Higher interest rates that result from borrowing to conduct contractionary fiscal policy\nC. Higher interest rates that result from borrowing to conduct expansionary fiscal policy\nD. Higher interest rates due to borrowing to conduct contractionary monetary policy\n\nassistant:The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to the phenomenon where government borrowing, whether through fiscal or monetary policy, increases interest rates and reduces the amount of private investment.
