The following month, the doctor was granted a license to practice optometry in that neighboring state by its board of optometrists.

Subsequently, the doctor decided to relocate his practice to the state for which Section 2022(a) applies. The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice. If the doctor challenges the constitutionality of Section 2022(a) of the medical licensing statute as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following, if factually true, is the WEAKEST defense that the state could offer?\n\nA.

Furthermore, the statute's requirement that optometrists graduate from an optometry school located in the state and accredited by the board of optometrists does not necessarily guarantee that the most qualified optometrists are practicing in the state. The doctor in question was licensed and practicing optometry in a neighboring state, and had been practicing for approximately one year before relocating to the state in question. Therefore, the state's primary concern should be the constitutionality of the statute, rather than whether it ensures that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.",
