False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every group of order 159 is cyclic.\nThis statement is true. A group of order 159 is a p-group (a group with order that can be written as a product of prime numbers). In this case, the order can be written as 3 * 53. According to the Sylow theorems, there must be a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 53-subgroup in the group. The Sylow 3-subgroup must be cyclic, and thus the group is also cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\nThis statement is false. A group of order 102 is a 2-group (a group with order that can be written as a power of a prime number). In this case, the order can be written as 2 * 2 * 23. According to the Sylow theorems, there must be a Sylow 2-subgroup in the group. However, a Sylow 2-subgroup is always normal in a group, and in this case, it is also abelian (since 2 is prime). Therefore, the group is a direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup and a group of order 23, and there are no nontrivial proper normal subgroups in this case.",
