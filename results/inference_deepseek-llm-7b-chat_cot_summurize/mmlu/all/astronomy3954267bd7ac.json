Effelsberg Telescope\n\nassistant:The largest parabolic antenna among the given options is the Arecibo Telescope. The Arecibo Telescope, also known as the Arecibo Observatory, is a radio telescope located in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. It has a parabolic dish antenna that is 300 meters in diameter and was originally built to detect and study radio signals from space. The Green Bank Telescope, Effelsberg Telescope, and Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope are also important radio telescopes, but their parabolic antenna diameters are smaller compared to the Arecibo Telescope.",
