In this case, the MPC is given as 0.90, which means that for every dollar of additional disposable income, $0.90 will be spent on consumption.\n\nAutonomous private investment refers to investment that occurs without government intervention or policy influence. In this case, we are given that $100 of new autonomous private investment is added to the economy.\n\nAggregate demand is the total amount of goods and services that firms are willing to produce in the economy at a given price level. It is influenced by factors such as consumption, investment, government expenditure, and net exports.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between autonomous private investment and aggregate demand. Autonomous private investment increases the level of production in the economy, which in turn leads to an increase in consumption. As consumption increases, aggregate demand shifts to the right, indicating an increase in the overall demand for goods and services.\n\nTo calculate the amount by which aggregate demand would shift to the right with the addition of $100 of autonomous private investment and a marginal propensity to consume of 0.90, we can use the following formula:\n\n\u0394Aggregate Demand = (Autonomous Private Investment \u00d7 Marginal Propensity to Consume) / (1 - Marginal Propensity to Save)\n\n\u0394Aggregate Demand = (100 \u00d70.90) / (1 - 0.90)\n\n\u0394Aggregate Demand = (90) / (0.10)\n\n\u0394Aggregate Demand = 900\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $900. The addition of $100 of autonomous private investment to an economy with a marginal propensity to consume of 0.90 will shift aggregate demand by $900 to the right.",
