This is most clearly an example of\n\nA. sexual selection.\nB. disruptive selection.\nC. balancing selection.\nD. frequency-dependent selection.\n\nassistant:The answer is A. sexual selection.\n\nThis phenomenon is an example of sexual selection, which is a type of natural selection that occurs when the sex ratio of a species is biased towards one or the other sex. In this case, the minority sex (the sex with fewer members) receives more care and resources from parents, which allows it to survive and reproduce more successfully. This can lead to a skewed sex ratio in the population over time.",
