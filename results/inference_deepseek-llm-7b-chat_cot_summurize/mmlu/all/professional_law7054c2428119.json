The employee's complaints regarding the insufficient lighting were factually true and justifIable.\n\nassistant:Option C would be the most helpful for the employee's cause of action. This is because it shows that the employee relied on the statement in the manual to continue working for the company, and this reliance would be a key element of the employee's argument based on promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel is a legal principle that allows a person to recover damages if they have relied on a promise made by another person, to their detriment. In this case, the employee's reliance on the statement in the manual would be their detriment, as they were fired after making repeated complaints about the lighting.",
