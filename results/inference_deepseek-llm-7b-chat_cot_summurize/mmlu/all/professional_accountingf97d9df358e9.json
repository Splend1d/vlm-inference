Lind's employees do not work on Saturdays and Sundays. The last payroll was paid on June 18. On Wednesday, June 30, the month-end balance in the salaries expense account before accruals was $14,000. What amount should Lind report as salaries expense in its income statement for the month ended June 30?\n\nA. $24,000\nB. $22,000\nC. $20,000\nD. $18,000\n\nassistant:To determine the amount Lind should report as salaries expense for the month ended June 30, we need to calculate the salaries expense for the period from June 1 to June 30. Since the last payroll was paid on June 18, and the pay period is every other Friday, there were two pay periods in June. The first pay period includes the payroll paid on June 18, and the second pay period includes the payroll paid on the last day of the month, which is July 1.\n\nLet's find the number of workdays in each pay period:\n\n1. First pay period: 10 workdays (June 1-10) + 1 workday (June 11) + 1 workday (June 12) + 1 workday (June 13) + 2 workdays (June 14-15) + 1 workday (June 16) + 1 workday (June 17) + 1 workday (June 18) + 1 workday (June 19) + 1 workday (June 20) + 1 workday (June 21) + 1 workday (June 22) + 1 workday (June 23) + 1 workday (June 24) + 1 workday (June 25) + 1 workday (June 26) + 1 workday (June 27) + 1 workday (June 28) + 1 workday (June 29) + 1 workday (June 30) = 36 workdays\n\n2. Second pay period: 1 workday (June 30) + 1 workday (July 1) = 2 workdays\n\nNow, let's find the number of employees working during each pay period:\n\n1. First pay period: 18 workdays (June 1-10) + 1 workday (June 11) + 1 workday (June 12) + 1 workday (June 13) + 2 workdays (June 14-15) + 1 workday (June 16) + 1 workday (June 17) + 1 workday (June 18) + 1 workday (June 19) + 1 workday (June 20) + 1 workday (June 21) + 1 workday (June 22) + 1 workday (June 23) + 1 workday (June 24) + 1 workday (June 25) + 1 workday (June 26) + 1 workday (June 27) + 1 workday (June 28) + 1 workday (June 29) + 1 workday (June 30) = 18 employees\n\n2. Second pay period: 1 workday (June 30) + 1 workday (July 1) = 2 employees\n\nNow, let's calculate the salaries expense for each pay period:\n\n1. First pay period: $10,000 / 36 workdays = $277.78 per employee\n2. Second pay period: $10,000 / 2 workdays = $5,000 per employee\n\nSince the last payroll was paid on June 18, we can assume that the salaries expense for the first pay period is Lind's estimated expense for the period. Therefore, we can use the average salary per employee for the first pay period:\n\nSalaries expense for the first pay period: 18 employees * $277.78 per employee = $4,984.84\n\nSalaries expense for the second pay period: 2 employees * $5,000 per employee = $10,000\n\nTotal salaries expense for the period: $4,984.84 + $10,000 = $14,984.84\n\nNow, let's calculate the month-end balance before accruals for the second pay period:\n\n$14,000 (last month-end balance) + $14,984.84 (salaries expense for the period) = $28,984.84\n\nSince the salaries expense for the second pay period is already included in the month-end balance, we can use the average salary per employee for the second pay period to determine the salaries expense for the month ended June ",
