This finding was based on the results of a survey conducted among a sample of young adults, in which 75% of the women reported feeling regret following their first sexual experience, compared to only 25% of the men. This disparity in feelings may be attributed to a variety of factors, such as differences in expectations, communication, and cultural influences.",
