What is the cost of one gradient descent update given the gradient?\n\nA. O(D)\nB. O(N)\nC. O(ND)\nD. O(ND^2)\n\nassistant:The cost of one gradient descent update depends on various factors such as the number of features (D), the number of training examples (N), and the cost function itself. However, a typical gradient descent update has a linear cost in the number of features (D) and the number of training examples (N). Therefore, the cost of one gradient descent update can be represented as O(N)D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. O(N)",
