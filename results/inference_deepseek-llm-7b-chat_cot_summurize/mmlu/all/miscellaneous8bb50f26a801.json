Cinco de Mayo.\n\nCinco de Mayo is a Mexican holiday that takes place on May 5th. It celebrates the Mexican army's victory over the French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. The holiday is not as widely celebrated in Mexico as Mexican Independence Day (A), but it has gained popularity in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nOption B, Santa Anna's Birthday, is not a Mexican holiday. Santa Anna was a Mexican general and president, but his birthday is not a national holiday in Mexico.\n\nOption D, Christmas, is a Christian holiday that occurs on December 25th and is not related to Cinco de Mayo.",
