The allowable deductions are the trust expenses, which are not given in the problem. However, we can calculate the distributable net income based on the income and expenses provided.\n\nTotal income = Dividend income + Taxable interest income + Capital gains + Trustee fees (allocable to income) + Accounting fees (allocable to income)\n\nTotal income = $2500 + $2000 + $5000 + $750 + $500\nTotal income = $15,000\n\nNow, let's assume the trust expenses are $5,000.\n\nDistributable net income = Total income - Trust expenses\nDistributable net income = $15,000 - $5,000\nDistributable net income = $10,000\n\nHowever, the answer choices do not include $10,000. It is possible that there is an error in the problem or the answer choices. Please double-check the problem and answer choices.",
