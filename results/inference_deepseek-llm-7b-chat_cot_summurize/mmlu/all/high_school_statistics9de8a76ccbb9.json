If A and B are independent? If B is a subset of A?\n\nA. 0.44, 0.5, 0.2\nB. .44, 0.5, 0.3\nC. .5, 0.44, 0.2\nD. .5, 0.44, 0.3\n\nassistant:To find the probability of the union of mutually exclusive events A and B, we add their individual probabilities: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B).\n\nIf A and B are independent, their probabilities are additive: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B).\n\nIf B is a subset of A, we can consider the two events as one: A \u222a B = A. In this case, the probability of the union is equal to the probability of A: P(A \u222a B) = P(A).\n\nSo, for each scenario, we have:\n\n1. P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5\n2. P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5\n3. P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 (since B is a subset of A)\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3.",
