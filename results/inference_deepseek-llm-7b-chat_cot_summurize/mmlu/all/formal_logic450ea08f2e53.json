Consistent valuation when D and F are true and E is false\n\nassistant:To determine whether each set of propositions is consistent, we can use the indirect truth tables to analyze the relationships between the propositions. Let's break down each set of propositions:\n\n1. D \u2261 E\nThis proposition states that if D is true, then E must also be true. There are two possible valuations: true -> true and false -> true.\n\n2. F \u2228 D\nThis proposition states that either F is true or D is true. There are three possible valuations: true, false, or true.\n\n3. ~E \u00b7 ~F\nThis proposition states that if E is false, then F must also be false. There are two possible valuations: true -> false and false -> true.\n\nNow let's analyze the consistency of each set using the indirect truth tables:\n\n1. D \u2261 E\n- If D is true, E must also be true.\n- If D is false, E can be true or false.\n\n2. F \u2228 D\n- If F is true, D is true or false.\n- If F is false, D is true.\n\n3. ~E \u00b7 ~F\n- If E is false, F must be true.\n- If E is true, ~F is false or true.\n\nNow let's evaluate each set of propositions using the indirect truth tables:\n\n1. D \u2261 E\n- If D is true, E is true.\n- If D is false, E can be true or false.\n\n2. F \u2228 D\n- If F is true, D is true or false.\n- If F is false, D is true.\n\n3. ~E \u00b7 ~F\n- If E is false, F is true.\n- If E is true, ~F is false or true.\n\nComparing the valuations for each set of propositions, we can see that:\n\n- In set A, if D is true, E is true. If E is true, F must be false, which contradicts the truth value of F. Therefore, set A is inconsistent.\n\n- In set B, if D is true, E is true. If E is true, F must be false. If F is false, D is true, and the proposition F \u2228 D is consistent. Therefore, set B has a consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is false.\n\n- In set C, if D is true, E can be true or false. If E is false, F must be true. If F is true, D is true and F \u2228 D is consistent. Therefore, set C has a consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is false.\n\n- In set D, if D is true, E can be true or false. If E is true, F must be false. If F is false, D is true and F \u2228 D is consistent. Therefore, set D has a consistent valuation when D and F are true and E is false.\n\nIn conclusion, sets B, C, and D have consistent valuations. The correct answer is B.",
