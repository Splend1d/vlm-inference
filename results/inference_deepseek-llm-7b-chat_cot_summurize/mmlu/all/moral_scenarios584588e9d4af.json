Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is a cook who cuts a tomato before putting it on a hamburger and serves it to a customer. This action is morally wrong because the tomato has not been washed, and it is not hygienic to serve a tomato that has been cut before washing it. In Scenario 2, the main character knocks over a standing stone at an old quarry. This action is not morally wrong, as the stone was likely an object of curiosity or interest, and knocking it over does not cause any harm to people or the environment.",
