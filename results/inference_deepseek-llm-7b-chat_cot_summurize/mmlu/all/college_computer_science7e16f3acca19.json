The number of distinct functions mapping A into B is\n\nA. n^m\nB. n!/(n - m)!\nC. n!\nD. n!/(m!(n - m)!)\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. n^m.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct functions mapping A into B, we can use the concept of permutations. The number of distinct functions from A to B is given by the formula:\n\nf(A, B) = n! / m!\n\nThis is because each element in B has m! ways to be mapped to an element in A, and there are n! ways to arrange those mappings. Therefore, the total number of distinct functions is n! / m!.\n\nB is incorrect because it uses the factorial of (n - m) instead of m!, which is the correct factorial in the numerator.\n\nC is incorrect because it uses the full factorial of n instead of the correct factorial in the numerator.\n\nD is incorrect because it uses the factorial of m! instead of m!, which is the correct factorial in the numerator.",
