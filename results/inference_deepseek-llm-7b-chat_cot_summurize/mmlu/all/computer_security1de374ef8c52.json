Speed\nB. Space\nC. Key exchange\nD. Key length\n\nassistant:Public key encryption is advantageous over symmetric key cryptography because of key exchange (option C).\n\nPublic key encryption allows for secure key exchange, which is a crucial aspect of secure communication in a network. It enables two parties, who do not trust each other, to establish a shared secret key for secure communication without revealing the key to an adversary. This is particularly important in scenarios where the parties need to communicate securely over an insecure channel, such as the internet.\n\nSymmetric key cryptography, on the other hand, requires the same key to be used for both encryption and decryption. This poses a significant challenge in key exchange, as the key must be securely transmitted to the recipient before communication can begin. If the key is intercepted during transmission, the communication is compromised.\n\nTherefore, public key encryption is advantageous over symmetric key cryptography because it allows for secure key exchange, which is crucial for secure communication in a network.",
