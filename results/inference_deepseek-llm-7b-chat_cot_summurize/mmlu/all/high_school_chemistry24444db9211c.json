CH3CH2CH2CH2Br\n\nassistant:To determine which of the following molecules is expected to have the highest normal boiling point, we can look at the intermolecular forces present in each molecule.\n\nA. CH3CH2CH2CH3 (ethene) - This molecule has a double bond, which results in a lower boiling point due to the presence of a stronger van der Waals force between the atoms.\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (ethanol) - This molecule has a higher boiling point due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group and the methoxy group.\n\nC. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl (ethene chloride) - This molecule has a lower boiling point than ethanol due to the presence of a stronger London dispersion force between the atoms.\n\nD. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (ethene bromide) - This molecule has a lower boiling point than ethanol due to the presence of a stronger London dispersion force between the atoms.\n\nBased on the intermolecular forces present in each molecule, the molecule with the highest normal boiling point is:\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (ethanol)",
