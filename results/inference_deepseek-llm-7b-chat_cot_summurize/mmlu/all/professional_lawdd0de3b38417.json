The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n\nassistant:The most accurate statement is C. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman. The handyman originally agreed to repair the microwave for $100 in two weeks, but failed to do so within the promised timeframe. Instead, he took the microwave to the repair store, which agreed to repair it for $80 within one week. However, if the repair store fails to repair the microwave, both the handyman and the repair store have breached their respective agreements with the woman. Therefore, she has a cause of action against both parties.",
