If the reaction is in equilibrium, which of the following would allow more product C to be produced?\n\nA. removing some of reactant A\nB. removing some of reactant C\nC. adding more enzyme K\nD. increasing the temperature of the system\n\nassistant:To determine which option would allow more product C to be produced, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. removing some of reactant A - Removing reactant A would increase the concentration of B, which could possibly shift the equilibrium towards products (A + B \u2192 C + 2K). However, this would depend on the specific reaction and the conditions of the equilibrium.\n\nB. removing some of reactant C - Removing reactant C would not affect the concentration of reactant A or reactant B. Therefore, it would not directly affect the equilibrium.\n\nC. adding more enzyme K - Adding more enzyme K would increase the rate of the reaction and shift the equilibrium in favor of the products (A + B \u2192 C + 2K). This would allow more product C to be produced.\n\nD. increasing the temperature of the system - Increasing the temperature of the system would increase the reaction rate. However, it might also increase the activation energy of the reaction, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium constant. This could potentially shift the equilibrium towards the reactants, rather than the products.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best option to allow more product C to be produced is by adding more enzyme K.",
