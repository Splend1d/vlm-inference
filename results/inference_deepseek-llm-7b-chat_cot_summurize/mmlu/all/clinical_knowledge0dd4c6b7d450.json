This is because it can help to neutralize the buildup of hydrogen ions (H+) in the muscles, which can cause fatigue and reduce performance.\n\nWhen sodium bicarbonate is ingested, it helps to raise the pH of the extracellular fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the muscles. This increased pH allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscles, which helps to reduce the buildup of these ions and improves the overall performance of the athlete.\n\nIt is important to note that while sodium bicarbonate can be beneficial for athletes, it is not a substitute for proper training and nutrition. It is best used as a supplement to a well-rounded training and nutrition plan, and should not be relied upon as the sole means of improving performance.",
