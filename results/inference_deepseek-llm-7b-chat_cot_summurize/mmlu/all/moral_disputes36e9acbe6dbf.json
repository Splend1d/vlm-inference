This option seems to be the most relevant, as it directly relates to the concept of pleasure, which is a key aspect of utilitarianism.\n\nOption B: The essential defect is that utilitarianism ignores autonomy. This option is also relevant, as autonomy is an important concept in moral philosophy. However, Ross's criticism is not specifically about autonomy, so this is not the most appropriate answer.\n\nOption C: The essential defect is that utilitarianism ignores epistemological responsibility. This option is not directly related to Ross's claim, as epistemological responsibility is not a central aspect of utilitarianism.\n\nOption D: The essential defect is that utilitarianism ignores the personal character of duty. This option is not directly related to Ross's claim, as personal character of duty is not a central aspect of utilitarianism.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is option A: The essential defect of utilitarianism is that it ignores the value of pleasure.",
