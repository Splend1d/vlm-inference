The prosecutor served a trial subpoena directing the mayor's attorney to produce private bank records that the mayor delivered to the attorney. The attorney refused the request. The prosecutor in a hearing then sought to compel compliance with the subpoena. The court should\n\nA. compel production, because it would not violate the attorney-client privilege.\nB. compel production, because there is no element of confidentiality.\nC. not compel production, because it would violate the mayor's privilege against self- incrimination.\nD. not compel production, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Not compel production, because it would violate the mayor's privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a person cannot be compelled to be a witness against themselves. This means that the mayor's attorney cannot be compelled to produce the private bank records that the mayor provided to him. The attorney-client privilege does not apply in this situation because the records were not created by the attorney for the purpose of providing legal advice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, even if the attorney-client privilege did not apply, the mayor's privilege against self-incrimination would still prevent the production of the records.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is an element of confidentiality in this situation. The mayor's attorney has a duty to protect the privacy of his client, which includes preventing the production of confidential information.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the attorney-client privilege does not apply in this situation. The privilege protects confidential communications between a client and their attorney, but it does not protect the records themselves.",
