This means that he should have expected that the security guards might be carrying weapons while on patrol. Therefore, if the burglar were to bring a claim against the owner for negligently supervising the security company, he would most likely succeed in his case.\n\nA. This option is not correct because the burglar was unarmed when he was shot, and it is not relevant to the owner's responsibility for the security services provided.\nC. This option is not correct because the owner's absence at the time of the shooting does not absolve him of responsibility for the security company's actions.\nD. This option is not correct because the fact that the owner had discontinued the security services does not absolve him from any negligence on the part of the security company. The company was still responsible for providing adequate protection until the owner's request to discontinue was received and implemented.",
