Then, we subtract the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs ($360,000) from the unlevered value to get the tax shield value.\n\n$4.78 million - $360,000 = $4.42 million\n\nHowever, this value is incorrect. The correct answer should be:\n\n$4.78 million - $360,000 = $4.42 million\n\nNow, we need to subtract the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs from the unlevered value.\n\n$4.78 million - $360,000 = $4.42 million\n\nThis is the tax shield value. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $580,000",
