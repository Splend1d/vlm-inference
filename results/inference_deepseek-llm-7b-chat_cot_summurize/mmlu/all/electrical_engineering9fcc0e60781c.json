Column number on periodic table.\nB. Atomic mass.\nC. Row number on periodic table.\nD. Atomic number.\n\nassistant:The number of rings in the Bohr model of an element is determined by the atomic number. In the Bohr model, an element is represented by an atom with a nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the atomic number of the element, which is also the number of electrons in the atom's outermost energy level. In the Bohr model, each energy level is associated with a specific number of electrons, and the number of electrons determines the number of rings in the model. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Atomic number.",
