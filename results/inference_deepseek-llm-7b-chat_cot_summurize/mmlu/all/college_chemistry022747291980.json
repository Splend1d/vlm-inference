To do this, I will search my knowledge base for the relevant information on the 13C spectra of the different isomers of C6H14.\n\nI find that the isomer with five distinct chemical shifts in its 13C spectrum is 3-methylpentane (C6H14). This is because 3-methylpentane has two methyl groups, each of which contributes to one distinct chemical shift in the 13C spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3-methylpentane.",
