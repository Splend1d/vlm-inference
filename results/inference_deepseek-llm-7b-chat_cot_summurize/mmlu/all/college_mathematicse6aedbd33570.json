None\nB. One\nC. Four\nD. Five\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to find the pattern of the number of zeros at the end of k! for positive integers k.\n\nLet's consider the pattern of the number of zeros at the end of k!:\n\nk! = 10^(3k) (since there are 3 zeros for every factorial term)\n\nSo, the number of zeros at the end of k! is directly proportional to 10^3k.\n\nNow, let's find the values of k for which the number of zeros is exactly 99:\n\n10^3k = 99\n\nk! = 10^(3k) = 99\n\nFrom this equation, we can deduce that k = 4. This is the only value of k for which the ordinary decimal representation of k! ends in exactly 99 zeros.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (One).",
