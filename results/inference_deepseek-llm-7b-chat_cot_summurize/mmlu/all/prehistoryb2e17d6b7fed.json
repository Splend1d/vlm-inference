Homo erectus.\nB. Homo habilis.\nC. Homo ergaster.\nD. Australopithecus afarensis.\n\nassistant:Homo floresiensis is a species of hominin that was found on the island of Flores in Indonesia. It is generally considered to be a member of the Homo genus, and is often referred to as \"hobbits\" due to their small size.\n\nBased on the available evidence, it appears that Homo floresiensis is most closely related to Homo erectus. Homo erectus is a species of hominin that lived during the early to mid-Pleistocene epoch, and is considered to be the direct ancestor of modern humans.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that Homo floresiensis may have been a descendant of Homo erectus that underwent a process of dwarfism, leading to their small size. However, this hypothesis is still the subject of much debate and research.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Homo erectus.",
