While the Ancestral Pueblo people did have a deep understanding of astronomy and used it for religious purposes, it was not the primary factor in their rise to power.\n\nB. constructed monuments and elaborate multi-storied cliff dwellings.\n\nThis is partially correct. Ancestral Pueblo people did build cliff dwellings, which were both practical and impressive structures. However, the construction of these dwellings was not the main reason for their rise to power.\n\nC. stored food surpluses in good years for distribution in bad years.\n\nThis is also not entirely accurate. While the Ancestral Pueblo people did store food, this was not the primary factor in their rise to power.\n\nD. incorporated other societies through conquest warfare.\n\nThis is not accurate at all. Ancestral Pueblo people were not known for conquest warfare. They were skilled farmers and lived in harmony with the environment.\n\nIn summary, the power of Ancestral Pueblo elites emerged when certain groups constructed monuments and elaborate multi-storied cliff dwellings.",
