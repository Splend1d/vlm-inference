We will follow the steps below:\n\n1. Determine the total current liabilities (liabilities due within one year) and long-term liabilities (liabilities due more than one year).\n2. Add up the amounts of each type of liability to get the total liabilities.\n3. Subtract the total liabilities from the company's total assets to find the net assets (equity).\n4. The net assets will be presented as a single line item on the classified balance sheet.\n\nStep 1: Calculate total liabilities\n- $1,000,000 line of credit (one year) + $250,000 (drawn) + $750,000 (secured note due in 5 annual installments) + $300,000 (balloon note) = $2,000,000\n\nStep 2: Calculate current liabilities (liabilities due within one year)\n- $1,000,000 line of credit (one year) + $250,000 (drawn) = $1,250,000\n\nStep 3: Calculate long-term liabilities (liabilities due more than one year)\n- $2,000,000 total liabilities - $1,250,000 current liabilities = $750,000\n\nStep 4: Calculate net assets (equity)\n- Total assets - Total liabilities = Net assets\n- $1,000,000 (line of credit drawn) + $300,000 (balloon note) + $750,000 (secured note due in 5 annual installments) + $250,000 (secured note due in 5 annual installments) = $2,000,000\n- $2,000,000 Total assets - $1,000,000 - $750,000 - $300,000 = $50,000\n\nNow we can calculate the total liabilities and net assets:\n- $1,250,000 current liabilities + $750,000 long-term liabilities + $50,000 net assets = $2,050,000\n\nOn the classified balance sheet, the company's debt would be presented as follows:\n- Current liabilities of $1,250,000; long-term liabilities of $750,000; net assets of $50,000\n\nAnswer: D. Current liabilities of $500,000; long-term liabilities of $800,000",
