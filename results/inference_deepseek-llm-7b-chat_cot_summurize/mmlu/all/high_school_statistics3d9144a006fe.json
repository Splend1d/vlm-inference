The reporter then constructed a scatterplot and computed a correlation coefficient to show the relation between a car\u2019s speed and its stopping distance.

This method is used to understand the relationship between different factors and is not related to the blinding of a study. Therefore, none of the options provided accurately describe the scenario.",
