The fundamental attribution error.\n\nThe fundamental attribution error is a cognitive bias that occurs when we attribute other people's behavior to their inherent personality traits or disposition, rather than considering external factors that may have influenced their actions. In this case, the customer incorrectly attributes the clerk's impatience to her personality, rather than considering that the clerk may have been dealing with a difficult day or other external factors.",
