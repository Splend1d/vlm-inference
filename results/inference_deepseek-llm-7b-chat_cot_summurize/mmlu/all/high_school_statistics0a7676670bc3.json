Let p = the proportion of the mall\u2019s visitors who shop at the store. Which of the following pairs of hypotheses should be used to support this claim?\n\nA. H0: p \u2264 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60\nB.

H0: p > 0.60 and Ha: p 0.60\n\nassistant:To test the claim that over 60 percent of the mall's visitors shop at that store, we need to determine which of the given hypotheses should be used.\n\nThe claim is that p (the proportion of mall visitors who shop at the store) is greater than 0.60. Therefore, we should use the following hypotheses:\n\nH0: p \u2264 0.60\nHa: p > 0.60\n\nSo the correct answer is A.",
