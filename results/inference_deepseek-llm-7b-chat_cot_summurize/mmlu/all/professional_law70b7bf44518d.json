They allegedly participated together in robbing a bank in their hometown. After the son was arrested and given Miranda warnings, he confessed and admitted that he and his father took part in the bank robbery. The prosecution decided to charge the father and son in the same indictment and prosecute them together in a single trial.

This is known as the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine, which holds that any evidence obtained through an illegal search or seizure, or in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights, must be excluded from trial. In this case, the son's confession was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights, and as a result, it cannot be used against him or his father.",
