A well-fitting pouch.\nB. Changing the pouch every day.\nC. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.\nD. The use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.\n\nSkin excoriation, also known as skin irritation or skin breakdown, is a common problem for people with incontinence or other skin conditions. It is caused by the leakage of urine or stool onto the peristomal skin. This can cause the skin to become dry, cracked, and inflamed, which can lead to excoriation.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to skin excoriation. A well-fitting pouch (option A) and the use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin (option D) may help to prevent skin irritation, but they are not the primary cause of skin excoriation. Changing the pouch every day (option B) may also help to prevent skin irritation, but it is not the primary cause of skin excoriation.",
