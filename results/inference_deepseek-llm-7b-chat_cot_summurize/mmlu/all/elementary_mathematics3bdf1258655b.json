Round to the nearest hundredth if necessary.\n\nA. 8.86\nB. 42.25\nC. 32.54\nD. 38.44\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the value of m, which represents the unknown variable. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n18.5 / m = 3.60 / 7.5\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and solve for m:\n\n18.5 * 7.5 = 3.60 * m\n\n138.75 = 3.60m\n\nTo isolate m, we divide both sides of the equation by 3.60:\n\nm = 138.75 / 3.60\n\nm \u2248 38.44\n\nNow, let's round to the nearest hundredth if necessary:\n\nm \u2248 38.44\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 38.44.",
