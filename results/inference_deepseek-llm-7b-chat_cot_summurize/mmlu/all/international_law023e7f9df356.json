Monism posits that domestic laws are superior to international law\nD. Monism posits that domestic and international law never clash\n\nassistant:The fundamental premise of monist theory is that international and domestic laws are part of the same legal order. This means that while there may be differences in the way laws are implemented and enforced, they are still considered to be part of the same legal system. This differs from theories that argue for the superiority of one type of law over the other, such as positing that international law is superior to domestic laws (option A) or that domestic laws are superior to international law (option C). On the other hand, monist theory does not necessarily mean that domestic and international laws never clash (option D), as there may still be situations where they conflict. Instead, monist theory posits that these conflicts should be resolved in a way that respects the underlying principles of the legal order.",
