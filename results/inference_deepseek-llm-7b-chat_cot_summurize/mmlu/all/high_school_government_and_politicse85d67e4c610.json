White Southerners\nB. Labor union members\nC. African Americans\nD. Northern ethnic minorities\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each group mentioned and identify which one has the least liberal constituency among the options provided.\n\nA. White Southerners: White Southerners have traditionally been more conservative and have historically supported the Democratic Party. However, this group has become less influential in recent years.\n\nB. Labor union members: Labor union members are generally considered to be liberal, as they are typically in favor of progressive policies and worker rights.\n\nC. African Americans: African Americans have historically been a key constituency of the Democratic Party, supporting liberal policies such as civil rights and social justice.\n\nD. Northern ethnic minorities: Northern ethnic minorities have also been a significant part of the Democratic Party's base, as they are generally more liberal in their political views.\n\nComparing these groups, it is clear that the African American community has the least liberal constituency among the options provided. This is because they have historically supported the Democratic Party, even though they may not always support every liberal policy or candidate. Therefore, the answer is C. African Americans.",
