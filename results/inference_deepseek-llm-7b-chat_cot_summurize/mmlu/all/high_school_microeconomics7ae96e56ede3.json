As the total product of labor increases, the marginal product of labor (the additional output produced by increasing one unit of input, in this case, labor) also increases. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Marginal product of labor is at its minimum. This is not possible since the total product of labor is increasing at an increasing rate.\n\nC. Marginal product of labor is at its maximum. This is also incorrect, as the total product of labor is increasing. The marginal product of labor can never be at its maximum when the total product is increasing.\n\nD. Marginal cost is rising. This is irrelevant to the question of the marginal product of labor. The marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit of output, and it can vary depending on factors such as production costs and the level of output.",
