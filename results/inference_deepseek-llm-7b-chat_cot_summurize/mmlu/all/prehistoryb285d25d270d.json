All of the above\n\nIn South America, the first metals were worked using a combination of techniques, including casting, hammering, and smelting. These techniques were used to extract and shape metals from their ores, and were essential in the development of early metalworking traditions in the region.\n\nCasting is a process that involves pouring liquid metal into a mold and allowing it to cool and solidify. This technique was used to create a wide range of objects, including tools, weapons, and decorative items. Hammering is a technique that involves striking a metal object with a hammer or mallet, using force to shape and refine the metal. This technique was used to create a variety of objects, including tools and weapons, and was particularly important in shaping and smoothing the surfaces of metal objects. Smelting is a process that involves heating a mixture of ore and other materials in a furnace, until the metal is separated from the ore and can be extracted. This technique was used to extract and refine a wide range of metals, including gold, silver, and copper.",
