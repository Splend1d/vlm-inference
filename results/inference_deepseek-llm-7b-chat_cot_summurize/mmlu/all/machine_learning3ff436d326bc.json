Lasso, or L1 regularization, is a popular method for feature selection in machine learning. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which can shrink the coefficients of some features to zero, effectively removing them from the model. Ridge, or L2 regularization, is another method for feature selection, but it tends to produce larger coefficients, which may not necessarily remove irrelevant features as effectively as Lasso. Therefore, Lasso is more appropriate for feature selection.",
