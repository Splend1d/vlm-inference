They relied on the resources found in these environments, such as fish, plants, and other aquatic animals. The term \"lacustrine\" refers to resources found near or in a lake, so this is the correct answer for the first blank.\n\nThe Maritime Archaic, on the other hand, was a culture that lived near the coast and relied on resources found in the ocean. They hunted pelagic creatures, which are animals that live in the open ocean and are not attached to the seafloor. The term \"pelagic\" refers to these animals, so this is the correct answer for the second blank.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. lacustrine; pelagic.",
