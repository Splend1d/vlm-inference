Engineers assigned to the project have determined that, in order to jump the buses, the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h. If the distance of the track is 50m, at what rate must the car accelerate to reach this velocity?\n\nA. 13 m/s^2\nB. 26 m/s^2\nC. 7 m/s^2\nD. 17 m/s^2\n\nassistant:To calculate the rate at which the car must accelerate, we can use the formula:\n\na = (v_f - v_i) / t\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, v_f is the final velocity, v_i is the initial velocity, and t is the time taken.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for acceleration:\n\na = (v_f * t) / t\na = v_f\n\nSince the car needs to reach a velocity of 130 km/h, we need to convert that to m/s:\n\n130 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 36.11 m/s\n\nWe also need to convert the distance of the track to m:\n\n50 m * (1000 m/km) / (1000 m/km) = 50 m\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\na = 36.11 m/s\n\nTo find the acceleration in m/s^2, we can use the formula:\n\na = a * s\n\nwhere a is the acceleration in m/s and s is the acceleration in m/s^2.\n\na = 36.11 m/s * s\na = 36.11 m/s^2\n\nTherefore, the car must accelerate at a rate of 36.11 m/s^2 to reach a velocity of 130 km/h. The correct answer is A. 13 m/s^2.",
