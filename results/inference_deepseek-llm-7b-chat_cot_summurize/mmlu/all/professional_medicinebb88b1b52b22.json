Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast\n\nThe most appropriate next step in diagnosis for this patient is to perform a repeat ultrasonography of the right breast. This is because the patient has a history of increased glandularity in the right breast, which was noted at her most recent annual examination and was found to have likely benign findings on mammography and ultrasonography 2 months ago. The patient now presents with black discharge from the right nipple, which could be a sign of a blocked milk duct or a more serious condition such as a breast abscess or an infection. A repeat ultrasonography would allow the doctor to better visualize the right breast and assess the discharge more closely, and determine if further intervention is needed.",
