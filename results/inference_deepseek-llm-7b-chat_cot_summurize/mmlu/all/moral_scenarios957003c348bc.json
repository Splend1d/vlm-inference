While this may not be the most ethical way to handle exams, it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character ignites fireworks in an office building. This action clearly crosses the line into morally wrong behavior, as it is dangerous and could potentially cause harm to others.",
