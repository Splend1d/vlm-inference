It targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat.\nB. It required sophisticated machinery.\nC. Population growth has fallen so drastically that Africans don't need the increased food production.\nD. African agricultural production went up without its help.\n\nassistant:The primary reason the Green Revolution did not help Africa much was due to the fact that it targeted crops that were not native to Africa, and did not take into account the cultural and environmental factors unique to the continent. Additionally, the Green Revolution required sophisticated machinery, which was not widely available in many African countries. While population growth in Africa has decreased, it is not the primary reason for the lack of success of the Green Revolution in Africa. Finally, it is important to note that African agricultural production did not necessarily go up without the help of the Green Revolution; there were various other factors at play, including lack of access to resources, political instability, and limited infrastructure.",
