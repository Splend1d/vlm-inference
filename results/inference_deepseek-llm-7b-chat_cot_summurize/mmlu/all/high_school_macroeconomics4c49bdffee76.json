Greater than $200 but less than $500\n\nassistant:To find the maximum amount the bank can lend, we can use the formula:\n\nMaximum lend = Total deposits \u00d7 (Reserve ratio)\n\nIn this case, the total deposits are $200 and the reserve ratio is 0.1. So we plug these values into the formula:\n\nMaximum lend = $200 \u00d7 (0.1)\n\nMaximum lend = $20\n\nSo, the maximum amount the bank can lend is $20, which corresponds to answer A.",
