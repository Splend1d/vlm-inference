The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. She has to pay daily operational costs of $250 and labor costs of $400. What expression represents her total cost if she has had the restaurant open for \u201c D \u201d days?\n\nA. 800,000 + 150 D\nB. 800,000 + 650 D\nC. 800,000 \u2212 650 D\nD. 650 + 800,000 D\n\nassistant:To find the total cost of having the restaurant open for \"D\" days, we need to add the initial cost, daily operational costs, and labor costs.\n\nTotal cost = Initial cost + (Daily operational costs * Number of days) + (Labor costs * Number of days)\n\nTotal cost = $800,000 + ($250 * D) + ($400 * D)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nTotal cost = $800,000 + $250D + $400D\n\nTotal cost = $800,000 + $650D\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 800,000 + 150 D.",
