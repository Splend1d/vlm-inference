The farmer moved to the city in 1986. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.\nB. the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.\nC. the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.\nD. the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.\n\nassistant:The most probable judicial determination in this case would be option B: the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.\n\nAdverse possession is a legal concept where a person who is not the rightful owner of property may gain ownership of it through possession and use over a certain period of time, depending on the laws of the state in which the property is located. In this case, the statutory period for adverse possession in the state is 20 years.\n\nThe man took possession of the land in 1987 and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997. He then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1999. This means that he spent a total of 20 years on the land, which is the required statutory period for adverse possession in this state.\n\nSince the man has fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor, the farmer would likely lose the suit in ejectment. The farmer may argue that the man's possession was not continuous, but this would not necessarily result in a win for the farmer, as the man's possession was still open, hostile, and continuous for the required statutory period.\n\nIn conclusion, the most probable judicial determination in this case would be that the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.",
