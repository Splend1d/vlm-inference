Capitalized as an other asset and amortized over five years.\nD. Expensed as incurred in the current period\n\nassistant:The $100,000 should be capitalized as part of goodwill and tested annually for impairment. This is because the acquisition costs are related to the purchase of net assets, which can be considered part of the goodwill of the company. Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price of an asset exceeds its value based on its fair market value and net working capital. The costs should be capitalized as an asset, and then tested annually for impairment to ensure that the carrying value of the asset is not greater than its fair value.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please let me know.",
