It explains the diversity of life on Earth and how species have evolved through time. The theory of evolution by natural selection states that over time, traits that are beneficial to an organism's survival and reproduction will become more common in a population, leading to the evolution of new species.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the theory of evolution is not just an educated guess. It is a well-supported scientific theory that has been extensively tested and confirmed through numerous observations and experiments.\n\nOption B is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the essence of the theory of evolution. While the theory of evolution does provide one possible explanation for the origin and development of species, it is supported by a wealth of evidence and has been extensively tested and refined by generations of scientists.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the theory of evolution is not just an opinion held by some scientists. It is a widely accepted scientific theory that has been supported by a vast amount of evidence from various fields of study, including paleontology, genetics, and comparative anatomy.",
