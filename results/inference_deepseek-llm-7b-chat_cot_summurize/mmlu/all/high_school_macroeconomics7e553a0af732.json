A decrease in the price level.\nB. An increase in labor productivity.\nC. An increase in the money supply.\nD. A decrease in the unemployment rate.\n\nassistant:A decrease in the price level can shift the production possibilities frontier outward. This is because a decrease in the price level makes goods and services cheaper, allowing individuals to purchase more with their income. As a result, individuals can produce more goods and services, and this increased production can shift the production possibilities frontier outward.\n\nAn increase in labor productivity can also shift the production possibilities frontier outward, but in a different way. An increase in labor productivity means that workers can produce more goods and services with the same amount of labor. This can lead to an increase in the amount of goods and services produced, which can also shift the production possibilities frontier outward.\n\nAn increase in the money supply can shift the production possibilities frontier inward, rather than outward. This is because an increase in the money supply can lead to inflation, which reduces the purchasing power of money. As a result, individuals can purchase fewer goods and services with their income, and this reduced production can shift the production possibilities frontier inward.\n\nA decrease in the unemployment rate can also shift the production possibilities frontier outward. This is because a decrease in the unemployment rate means that there are more workers available to produce goods and services. As a result, individuals can produce more goods and services, and this increased production can shift the production possibilities frontier outward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. A decrease in the price level.",
