It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.\n\nThe short-acting bronchodilator should be taken first because it works quickly to open up the airways, allowing other medications to be more effective. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The color-coding of medications is not a factor in determining which one should be taken first.\nC. The temperature of the medication does not affect its effectiveness.\nD. The moisture content of the medication is not a factor in determining its effectiveness.",
