High cost of labor in the core is NOT a spread effect in the core-periphery model of development. The spread effect in the core-periphery model refers to the process by which economic activities and population migrate from the center (core) to the periphery (less developed regions). Therefore, options A, C, and D are all related to the spread effect.",
