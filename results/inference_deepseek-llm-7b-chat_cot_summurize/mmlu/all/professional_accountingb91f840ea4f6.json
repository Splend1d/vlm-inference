The equipment consists of four major components, of which two components comprise 80% of the total cost and each has a 20-year useful life. The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each; one of them has a useful life of four years, and the other has a useful life of five years. The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Under IFRS, what is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1?\n\nA. $4,000,000\nB. $5,000,000\nC. $8,000,000\nD. $8,500,000\n\nassistant:To calculate the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, we need to determine the depreciation expense for each component and then sum them up.\n\n1. Two components comprise 80% of the total cost, so they have a cost of 0.8 * $100 million = $80 million each.\n2. The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each, so each of them has a cost of $10 million.\n\nNow, let's calculate the depreciation expense for each component:\n\n- Component 1 (80% of total cost, 20-year useful life):\nDepreciation expense = Cost / Useful life\nDepreciation expense = $80 million / 20 years\nDepreciation expense = $4 million per year\n\n- Component 2 (80% of total cost, 20-year useful life):\nDepreciation expense = $4 million per year\n\n- Component 3 (Cost = $10 million, Useful life = 4 years):\nDepreciation expense = $10 million / 4 years\nDepreciation expense = $2.5 million per year\n\n- Component 4 (Cost = $10 million, Useful life = 5 years):\nDepreciation expense = $10 million / 5 years\nDepreciation expense = $2 million per year\n\nNow, let's sum up the depreciation expenses for each component:\n\nTotal depreciation expense = $4 million (Component 1) + $4 million (Component 2) + $2.5 million (Component 3) + $2 million (Component 4)\nTotal depreciation expense = $12 million\n\nSo, the answer is C. $8,000,000.",
