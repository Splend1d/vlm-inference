No, because a condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay was not satisfied.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner did not provide the written agreement between the contractor and the homeowner. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the homeowner's satisfaction with the finish of the cabinets was a condition to her obligation to pay the balance of the contract price. However, even if it was not a condition, the contractor may still prevail in suing the homeowner for the balance of the contract price, as the homeowner has breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.",
