This is because many antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), work by increasing the levels of serotonin, which can help to improve mood and alleviate symptoms of depression. Dopamine and acetylcholine are not typically targeted by antidepressants, and thorazine is an older medication that is not typically used to treat depression.",
