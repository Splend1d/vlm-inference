The process works best in conducting, but non-magnetic materials (A). This is because the alternating magnetic field induces an electric current in the conductive material, which generates heat as a result of the resistance of the material.\n\nMagnetic materials can also be used for induction heating, but they can cause eddy currents which can lead to heat losses. Non-magnetic materials are preferred as they do not suffer from this issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. conducting but non-magnetic materials.",
