Sonia buys a shirt for $12.35 and Negin buys a pair of sandals for $10.11. How much money remains?\n\nA. $4.46 \nB. $4.54 \nC. $5.36 \nD. $5.76\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to find the total amount of money that Sonia and Negin have together. We can do this by adding the amounts of money they have together:\n\nTotal amount = $27.00\n\nNext, we need to subtract the amounts of money Sonia and Negin spend on the shirt and sandals. We can do this by performing the following calculations:\n\nSonia's purchase = $12.35\nNegin's purchase = $10.11\n\nSubtracting these purchases from the total amount will give us the remaining money:\n\nRemaining amount = Total amount - (Sonia's purchase + Negin's purchase)\n\nRemaining amount = $27.00 - ($12.35 + $10.11)\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\nRemaining amount = $27.00 - ($22.46)\n\nRemaining amount = $4.54\n\nThe correct answer is B. $4.54.",
