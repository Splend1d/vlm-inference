It can be remedied by redistribution of wealth.\nB. If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just.\nC. Historical factors are secondary to moral imperatives.\nD. He has no answer.\n\nassistant:Nozick's answer to the criticism of his historical entitlement theory is that if the distribution of goods in society is unjust, those at the bottom always lose. However, he argues that this does not necessarily mean that the unjust distribution of goods is the only possible one, or that it is the best possible one. Instead, he suggests that there are other factors that can contribute to the distribution of goods in society, such as historical factors and moral imperatives.\n\nNozick believes that if each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just. This means that if the goods in society are distributed in a way that is fair and just for each individual, then the overall distribution of goods will also be fair and just. He argues that this is the most important factor in determining the fairness of the distribution of goods in society, and that it should be the primary concern of those who seek to improve the distribution of goods.\n\nNozick also suggests that historical factors are secondary to moral imperatives. He argues that the past does not necessarily dictate the present or the future, and that moral principles should guide the distribution of goods in society. He believes that the moral principles of fairness and justice should be the foundation for any attempt to improve the distribution of goods in society.\n\nOverall, Nozick does not believe that the unjust distribution of goods in society is the only possible one, or that it is the best possible one. Instead, he argues that there are other factors that can contribute to the distribution of goods in society, such as historical factors and moral imperatives. He believes that if each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just, and that historical factors are secondary to moral imperatives.",
