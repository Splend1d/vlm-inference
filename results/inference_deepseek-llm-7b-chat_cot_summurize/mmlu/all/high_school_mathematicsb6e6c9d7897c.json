Domain and range remain the same\nB. Domain is double; range remains the same\nC. Domain is tripled; range is doubled\nD. Domain is the same; range is tripled\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to analyze the effect of changing the argument of sin x to 3 sin 2x on the domain and range of the function.\n\nThe sine function, sin x, has an undefined value at x = \u03c0/2 (or \u03c0/4 in radians), and its domain is all real numbers except these values. \n\nWhen we change sin x to 3 sin 2x, the argument of sin x is multiplied by 3. This means that the value of x that makes sin x undefined will also make 3 sin 2x undefined. The value of x that makes sin x undefined is \u03c0/2, so the value of x that makes 3 sin 2x undefined is also \u03c0/2. Therefore, the domain of 3 sin 2x is all real numbers except \u03c0/2.\n\nNow let's consider the range. The sine function has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. Therefore, the range of sin x is [-1, 1]. When we change sin x to 3 sin 2x, the argument of sin x is multiplied by 3. Since the sine function is an increasing function, multiplying it by a constant will result in an increasing function. Therefore, the range of 3 sin 2x will be the same as the range of sin x, which is [-1, 1].\n\nSo, the answer is A. Domain and range remain the same.",
