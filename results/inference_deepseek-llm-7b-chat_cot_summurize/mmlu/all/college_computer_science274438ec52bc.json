M = 6, m = 4\n\nassistant:To determine the maximum and minimum number of connected components in the collection of all undirected graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges, we can consider the possible cases for the number of edges in each graph.\n\n1. If a graph has exactly 6 edges, it will have the minimum number of connected components, m = 1. This is because each node must have a minimum of 1 edge, and the remaining edges must connect the nodes in at least 1 connected component.\n2. If a graph has 7 edges, it will have the maximum number of connected components, M = 10. This is because each node must have a maximum of 10 edges, and the remaining edges must connect the nodes in at least 10 connected components.\n3. If a graph has 8 or more edges, it will have a number of connected components between 7 and 10.\n4. If a graph has fewer than 6 edges, it will have a number of connected components between 1 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. M = 7, m = 4.",
