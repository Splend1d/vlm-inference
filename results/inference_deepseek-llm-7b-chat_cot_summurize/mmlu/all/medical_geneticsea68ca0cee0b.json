Klinefelter syndrome\nB. Ataxia telangiectasia\nC. Fanconi anaemia\nD. Bloom syndrome\n\nassistant:B. Ataxia telangiectasia is not a chromosome instability syndrome. It is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATX gene, which is responsible for the production of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein. Chromosome instability syndromes, such as those listed in options A, C, and D, are caused by defects in chromosomes or the mechanisms that maintain their stability.",
