The fallacy of false consolation involves responding to criticisms or charges of wrongdoing by pointing out positive aspects of the situation or suggesting that other people are worse off.\n\nOption A, arguing against a position based only on negative personal feelings, is not a fallacy of false consolation. It is a form of ad hominem attack, but it does not involve pointing out positive aspects of the situation or suggesting that other people are worse off.\n\nOption B, responding to charges of wrongdoing by saying others do things as bad or worse, is not a fallacy of false consolation. It is a form of tu quoque fallacy, which involves countering an accusation by making a similar or equally bad accusation against the accuser.\n\nOption D, using threats of harm instead of reasoning to get agreement, is not a fallacy of false consolation. It is a form of blackmail, which involves using threats of harm or negative consequences to get someone to do something they otherwise would not do.\n\nOption C, arguing that someone is not really harmed because things could be worse or by pointing out what they have to be thankful for, is the fallacy of false consolation. This argument is designed to minimize the seriousness of a problem or criticism by suggesting that things could be worse or by pointing out positive aspects of the situation. This is an ad hominem argument because it attacks the person making the criticism rather than addressing the substance of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
