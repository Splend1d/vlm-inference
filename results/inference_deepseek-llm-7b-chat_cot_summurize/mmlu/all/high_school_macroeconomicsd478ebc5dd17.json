This increase in economic activity can lead to an increase in the demand for money as a financial asset. When consumers demand more money as a financial asset, the money supply in the economy increases, which can lead to an increase in interest rates.\n\nOption B is incorrect because an increase in money demand for transactions would lead to an increase in the money supply, which would decrease interest rates, not increase them.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar would lead to a decrease in the demand for money, not an increase.\n\nOption D is incorrect because an increase in the demand for money for transactions would lead to an increase in the money supply, which would decrease interest rates, not increase them.",
