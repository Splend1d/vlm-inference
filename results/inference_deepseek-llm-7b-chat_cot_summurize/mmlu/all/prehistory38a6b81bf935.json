This is evident from the emergence of new technologies and tools that were traded between different regions, such as the Acheulean handaxe from Africa, which was traded to Europe during this period.\n\nThe Middle Paleolithic period saw the emergence of new technologies, such as the Aurignacian culture, but the acquisition of raw materials from greater distances was not as pronounced as it was during the Upper Paleolithic.\n\nThe Middle Paleolithic period saw the emergence of new technologies, such as the Aurignacian culture, but the acquisition of raw materials from greater distances was not as pronounced as it was during the Upper Paleolithic.\n\nThe Middle Paleolithic period saw the emergence of new technologies, such as the Aurignacian culture, but the acquisition of raw materials from greater distances was not as pronounced as it was during the Upper Paleolithic.\n\nThe Middle Paleolithic period saw the emergence of new technologies, such as the Aurignacian culture, but the acquisition of raw materials from greater distances was not as pronounced as it was during the Upper Paleolithic.",
