As the angle of the plane (measured from the horizontal) increases, the normal force\n\nA. increases linearly\nB. decreases linearly\nC. does not change\nD. decreases nonlinearly\n\nassistant:The answer is A. The normal force increases linearly with the angle of the plane. This is because the normal force is equal to the product of the weight and the perpendicular component of the gravitational force, which is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the box and the inclined plane. Therefore, as the angle increases, the normal force increases linearly.",
