Judicial reasoning is always formal.\n\nassistant:The criticism that is the most compelling is D. Judicial reasoning is always formal. This criticism is compelling because Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning implies that there is a clear and distinct difference between the two forms of reasoning. However, this may not be accurate, as judicial reasoning is not always formal. In fact, judges are often called upon to make decisions based on their understanding of the law and their experience in the field, rather than strictly following the formal style of reasoning. This criticism challenges the validity of Llewellyn's distinction and highlights the limitations of his approach.",
