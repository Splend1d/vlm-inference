The passenger, who was extremely exhausted after a long and hectic day, tried to sleep during the flight but was constantly being annoyed by the salesman. Once the flight departed, the salesman started ordering drinks of Scotch and water from the flight attendant, and became inebriated. When the passenger refused to talk to him, the salesman became very abusive to the passenger. Although there were many empty seats available on the plane in the first-class section, the passenger decided to remain seated next to the salesman. Finally, after the flight attendant had served the saleman his tenth drink of Scotch, he became belligerent and punched the passenger in the mouth. The passenger's two front teeth were knocked loose and she suffered a cut lip. If the passenger asserts a claim against the airline based on negligence, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because, as a first-class passenger, she was owed a special duty of care by the airline.\nB. prevail, because the flight attendant should have been aware that her conduct caused an unjustifiable risk of harm.\nC. not prevail, because the airline is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its passengers.\nD. not prevail, because the passenger assumed the risk by not moving to another seat away from the salesman.\n\nassistant:A. prevail, because, as a first-class passenger, she was owed a special duty of care by the airline.\n\nThe correct answer is A, because as a first-class passenger, the passenger was owed a special duty of care by the airline. Negligence claims typically require the plaintiff to prove that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, breached that duty, and that the breach caused the plaintiff's injury. In this case, the passenger was a first-class passenger, which suggests that the airline owed her a higher duty of care compared to other passengers. This higher duty of care would likely include a duty to protect the passenger from the abusive behavior of other passengers, such as the inebriated salesman who eventually assaulted her.\n\nB is incorrect because the flight attendant's conduct does not necessarily create an unjustifiable risk of harm. The passenger's injuries were caused by the actions of the salesman, not the flight attendant.\n\nC is incorrect because the airline is usually vicariously liable for the torts (i.e., wrongful acts) of its passengers if the passenger's actions are within the scope of their employment or business on the aircraft. In this case, the salesman's actions may be considered within the scope of his employment or business as a passenger, so the airline may be vicariously liable for his actions.\n\nD is incorrect because the passenger's decision not to move seats does not negate her right to recover damages for her injuries. Even if she could have avoided the situation by moving seats, she may still be able to recover damages for the injuries she suffered.",
