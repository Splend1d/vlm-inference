The evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis is relevant and admissible to give meaning to the ambiguous term \"2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each\" in the contract. The term \"2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each\" could be interpreted in different ways, and the evidence of trade usage could help clarify the meaning of the contract. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.",
