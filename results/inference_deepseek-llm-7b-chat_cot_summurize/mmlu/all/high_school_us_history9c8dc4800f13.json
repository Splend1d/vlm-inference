The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?\n\nA.

Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War. The excerpt states that Lincoln was reelected with a landslide victory, and his strong showing in the popular vote is attributed to the support he received from various groups, including native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, younger voters, and military personnel. These groups were likely drawn to Lincoln's stance on preserving the Union and his leadership during the Civil War. Additionally, Republicans gained seats in Congress, took back several state legislatures, and lost only the governorship of New Jersey. These results suggest that Union successes during the Civil War were a significant factor in Lincoln's reelection victory.",
