This type of statistics allows researchers to make generalizations about a population based on sample data, and can be used to test hypotheses about the population. Descriptive statistics and standard deviation are tools that provide information about the sample data itself, but do not allow researchers to make inferences about the population. A field experiment is a type of research design, but it does not provide the means to determine whether the observed differences between the experimental and control groups are statistically significant. Therefore, the correct answer is B. inferential statistics.",
