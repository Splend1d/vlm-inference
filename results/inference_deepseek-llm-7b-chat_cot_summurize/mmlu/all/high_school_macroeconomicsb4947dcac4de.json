As a result, the price of those products tends to rise, which leads to an increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Therefore, the CPI will automatically increase when products improve in quality.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because an increase in product quality should not lead to a decrease in CPI, a negative CPI, or an overestimation of the inflation rate, respectively.",
