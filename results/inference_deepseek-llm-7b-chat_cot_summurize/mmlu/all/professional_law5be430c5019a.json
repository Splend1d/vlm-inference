The defendant is a 15-year-old, which means she is under the age of 17. By attempting to purchase the shotgun, she has violated the statute.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the statute does not impose absolute criminal liability. The defendant must have committed the act, but she does not have to have the mental state required for the crime.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because ignorance of the law is not a valid defense in criminal cases. The defendant knew or should have known that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the legislative intent does not matter in this case. The statute is clear and the defendant has violated it.",
