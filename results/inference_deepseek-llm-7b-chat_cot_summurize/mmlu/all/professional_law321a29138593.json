Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n\nassistant:The court is likely to grant the plumber's motion for several reasons. Firstly, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action, which is a violation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This failure to respond may lead to a default judgment being entered against the plumber, but it does not necessarily mean that the court can proceed with that judgment. The plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment is an attempt to challenge the validity of the default judgment, and the court will review the motion to determine whether it should be granted or denied.\n\nSecondly, the plumber's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was denied, but that does not necessarily mean that the court has personal jurisdiction over the plumber. The plumber's citizenship is in State B, and the court is in State A. The court's denial of the motion to dismiss does not necessarily mean that the court has jurisdiction over the plumber.\n\nIn conclusion, the court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment. The plumber did not respond to the company's action, which may lead to a default judgment being entered against the plumber, but the court must still review the validity of that judgment and the plumber's motion to set it aside. Additionally, the court's denial of the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that the court has jurisdiction over the plumber.",
