This gap was discovered by the Cassini spacecraft during its flyby of Saturn in 2009. It is about 20,000 kilometers wide and is caused by the gravitational influence of the moon Phoebe, which is in an orbital resonance with Mimas. The Cassini division is one of the most prominent features of Saturn's A ring, and it is a popular target for imaging and telescopic observations of the planet.",
