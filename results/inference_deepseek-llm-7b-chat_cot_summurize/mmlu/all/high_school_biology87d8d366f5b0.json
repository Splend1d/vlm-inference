Allopatric speciation occurs when a population of organisms becomes isolated from the parent population due to geographical barriers, such as a river, mountain range, or ocean. Over time, the isolated population evolves and adapts to their new environment, leading to the formation of a new species. In this case, the pelicans were separated by geographical barriers, and over 150 years, they evolved and became unable to produce offspring with each other.",
