Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older. This is because the Moon has not experienced the same level of geological activity as the Earth, which has caused many of the Earth's rocks to be younger. Additionally, the Moon has a much lower rate of volcanic activity and tectonic plate movement, which has allowed the rocks to be exposed to the elements and eroded over time, making them appear older than their counterparts on Earth.",
