Economic opportunities were reduced.\nB. They were subjugated and destroyed.\nC. Economic opportunities were created.\nD. They were enriched through trade in agricultural goods.\n\nassistant:The passage provided by Christopher Columbus describes the initial interactions between the Spanish explorers and the indigenous people of Mexico. Columbus explains that the indigenous people would trade valuable resources such as cotton and gold for simple, useless objects, which he discouraged. Instead, he gave them more valuable and appealing items, with no expectation of return. This was done to win the trust and goodwill of the indigenous people, in order to convert them to Christianity and encourage them to support the Spanish crown.\n\nOn the other hand, the passage by Bartholomew de las Casas, a Dominican Bishop, describes the brutal treatment and destruction of the indigenous population by the Spanish. The Spanish, driven by their desire for gold and riches, have killed and destroyed millions of indigenous people. The population of Hispaniola, a Caribbean island, has been reduced from three million to only two hundred due to the Spanish conquest and colonization.\n\nGiven the information provided by these two sources, it is clear that the Columbian Exchange, the free flow of plants, animals, and trade goods between Europe and the Americas, affected the natives in a negative way. They were subjugated and destroyed by the Spanish, driven by their greed for gold and riches. The Columbian Exchange did not create economic opportunities for the natives, nor did it enrich them through trade in agricultural goods. Instead, it resulted in the loss of millions of lives and the decimation of entire cultures. Therefore, the correct answer is B. They were subjugated and destroyed.",
