His friend called him up one afternoon and asked to borrow his car for a date he had that night. The college student generously lent the car to his friend. On his way home from the date, basking in the memories of a beautiful evening, the friend lost control of the car and hit a pedestrian. As a result of the accident, and after learning that the friend had no money and no insurance, the pedestrian brought suit against the college student to recover for his injuries. He asserted a claim against the college student for negligent entrustment of a vehicle. During his case, the pedestrian introduced evidence that the friend had been in several previous accidents. In his defense, the college student offered the testimony of his girlfriend that the college student frequently lent his car to his friend. The girlfriend further testified that the college student gave his friend permission to use his car only after determining that the friend was a careful and attentive driver. The girlfriend's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as evidence of habit.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because it goes to the college student's character.\nD. inadmissible, because she is biased.\n\nassistant:The girlfriend's testimony is admissible as a present sense impression. Present sense impression testimony, also known as testimonial evidence of a present fact, refers to a person's firsthand knowledge or observation of a current event or situation. In this case, the girlfriend is testifying about her observation of the college student's behavior, such as frequently lending his car to the friend and giving the friend permission to use it only after determining that the friend was a careful and attentive driver. This type of testimony is allowed in most jurisdictions, as long as the witness does not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case and does not give opinions or speculate about the facts, but rather testifies to what she has observed or experienced.\n\nTo summarize, the answer is B. Admissible as a present sense impression.",
