In this case, the multiplicative order is the smallest positive integer n such that a^(11^n) = 1.\n\nLet's find a generator using the first few powers:\n\n1^1 = 1\n2^1 = 2\n3^1 = 3\n4^1 = 4\n5^1 = 5\n6^1 = 6\n7^1 = 7\n8^1 = 8\n9^1 = 9\n10^1 = 10\n11^1 = 11\n\nNow, let's check the powers of 2:\n\n2^1 = 2\n2^2 = 4\n2^3 = 8\n2^4 = 16\n\nThe powers of 2 are not powers of 11, so we need to find a different element. Let's try 3:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n\n3 is a generator for the finite field Z_11, as 3^10 = 3^9 * 3^8 * 3^7 * 3^6 * 3^5 * 3^4 * 3^3 * 3^2 * 3^1 = 1.",
