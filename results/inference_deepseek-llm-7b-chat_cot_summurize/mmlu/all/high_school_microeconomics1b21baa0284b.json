The price of firm A's cell phone service rises by 5 percent.\n2. The quantity demanded for firm B's cell phone service increases by 10 percent.\n\nTo determine the cross-price elasticity of demand for firms A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nCross-price elasticity of demand = (% change in quantity demanded for firm B / % change in price of firm A) * (-1)\n\nWe are given:\n\n- % change in price of firm A = 5%\n- % change in quantity demanded for firm B = 10%\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nCross-price elasticity of demand = (10% / 5%) * (-1) = -2\n\nSince the cross-price elasticity of demand is less than zero, it indicates that firms A and B are complements (i.e., they are complements because the cross-price elasticity is less than zero).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. firms A and B are complements because the cross-price elasticity is less than zero.",
