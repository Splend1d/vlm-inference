The man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.\n\nUnder adverse possession, the possessor must have actual, open, notorious, and continuous possession of the property for the statutory period of time, which is usually 20 years in many states, including the one mentioned in the scenario. In this case, the man took possession of the land in 1987 and remained on the land until 1997, which is a total of 10 years. He then left the property for one year to care for his sick mother, and then returned in 1999, which is a total of 2 years. When he returned, he continued in possession until 2010, which is a total of 11 years. This does not meet the statutory period of 20 years, so the man is not an adverse possessor, and the woman would be entitled to possession of the farm.",
