Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.\nD. Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary. The court will likely suppress the confession as being involuntarily given because the detective used religious deception to coerce the suspect into admitting guilt. The fact that the suspect understood his rights and refused to sign a waiver of the right to remain silent does not necessarily mean that the confession was voluntary. The use of religious deception to elicit a confession is not a valid technique and can be considered a form of coercion. Therefore, the court will likely suppress the confession as being involuntarily given.\n\nA. No, this answer is incorrect because the suspect did understand his rights and refused to sign a waiver of the right to remain silent, indicating that he did not want to talk to the police.\nB. No, this answer is also incorrect because the fact that the suspect did not ask for a lawyer does not necessarily mean that he understood his rights. He may have believed that he did not need a lawyer or that he could not afford one.\nC. Yes, this answer is incorrect because the fact that the suspect was questioned for over three hours does not necessarily mean that the confession was involuntary. The suspect could have freely chosen to admit guilt.",
