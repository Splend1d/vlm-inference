Is a contra-indication to colonoscopy\nC. May be associated with constipation\nD. always resolves with a gluten free diet.\n\nassistant:IBS is a condition that affects the large intestine and can cause abdominal pain, discomfort, and changes in bowel movements. It is primarily a functional gastrointestinal disorder, meaning that it is not caused by an identifiable physical abnormality. While it may have psychological components, it is not primarily a psychological problem.\n\nIBS is not a contra-indication to colonoscopy, which is a procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for signs of disease. However, some people with IBS may experience increased abdominal pain or discomfort during or after the procedure.\n\nIBS can be associated with constipation, which is a condition characterized by infrequent bowel movements or difficulty passing stool. However, IBS is also associated with diarrhea, which is a condition characterized by frequent, loose bowel movements.\n\nThere is no guaranteed cure for IBS, but some treatments can help manage symptoms. One common treatment is a gluten-free diet, which has been found to help some people with IBS. However, not everyone with IBS will find relief with a gluten-free diet, and it is not a guaranteed solution for everyone.",
