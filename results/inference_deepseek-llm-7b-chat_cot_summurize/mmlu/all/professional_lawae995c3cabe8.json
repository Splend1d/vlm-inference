The reason for this is that the police found the z-brand stereo in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom, which was not part of the area that they had searched, and therefore, it would not be relevant to the case. The other stereos, y-brand and x-brand, were found in areas that the police had searched, so they would be admissible as evidence.",
