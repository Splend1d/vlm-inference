Total revenue will not change.\n\nWhen the price of a product with inelastic demand is raised, consumers are still willing to pay the higher price. This means that the quantity demanded will not decrease, and thus, total revenue will not change. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because inelastic demand means that the product's price has less effect on the quantity demanded than a product with elastic demand.",
