This is because the hydrogen bonds between the peptide backbone atoms help to maintain the stability and shape of the alpha helix.\n\nHydrogen bonding is a type of intermolecular interaction that occurs between a hydrogen atom (H) bonded to a non-metal atom (X) and a non-metal atom (Y) that donates a lone pair of electrons. In the context of proteins, the peptide backbone consists of alternating amino and carboxyl groups, which contain a hydrogen atom bonded to a non-metal atom (R) and a non-metal atom (S), respectively. When these hydrogen atoms come into contact with the lone pair of electrons on a non-metal atom (Y) in another amino acid residue, a hydrogen bond forms. These hydrogen bonds help to maintain the stability and shape of the alpha helix, as they resist any changes in the configuration of the alpha helix.\n\nDisulfide bridges between cysteine side chains and carbohydrate moieties attached to polar amino acids are not the primary factors in stabilizing the alpha helix. While disulfide bridges and carbohydrate moieties can affect the overall stability of proteins, they are not as crucial to the stabilization of the alpha helix as hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms.\n\nPeptide linkages that covalently bond amino acids and disulfide bridges between cysteine side chains are also not the primary factors in stabilizing the alpha helix. While these peptide linkages and disulfide bridges help to maintain the overall stability of proteins, they are not as crucial to the stabilization of the alpha helix as hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbone atoms.",
