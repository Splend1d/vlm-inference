This process allows the embryo to differentiate into specific cell types, such as muscle cells, nerve cells, and other specialized cells. The differential distribution of substances in the egg also plays a crucial role in the development of the embryo's organs and systems, such as the heart, lungs, and digestive system. Additionally, it can influence the expression of specific genes during development, which may establish a pattern for the embryo as the cells divide.",
