The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nIn this case, the demand for the product falls while the supply increases. This means that there is an excess supply in the market. To clear the market, sellers will need to lower their prices, which will lead to a fall in the equilibrium price. However, the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate because the change in demand and supply has not yet led to a new stable equilibrium.",
