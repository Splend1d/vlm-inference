Both of these\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:An electron can be speeded up by (D. Neither of these) option.\n\nHere's how I came up with the answer:\n\nAn electron is a fundamental particle that has a negative charge. In the context of physics, electrons can be accelerated by electric and magnetic fields.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because an electric field can accelerate charged particles by applying a force to them, which in turn causes the particles to move faster. However, an electron already has a negative charge, so it will experience a repulsive force from the electric field, which will not speed it up.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because a magnetic field can accelerate charged particles by applying a force to them, which in turn causes the particles to move faster. However, an electron already has a negative charge, so it will experience a force in the direction of the magnetic field. If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the electric field, the combined effect of the electric and magnetic fields will be to slow down the electron, not speed it up.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the correct answer is option (D), which states that an electron cannot be speeded up by either an electric field or a magnetic field.",
