Eighteenth century scientific racism\n\nassistant:The ideas expressed in Phillis Wheatley's poem most directly reveal the influence of The First Great Awakening. This religious revival in the 18th century emphasized personal conversion, emotional experience, and individual responsibility, which can be seen in Wheatley's poem as she describes being \"brought\" from her \"Pagan land\" and learning about God and redemption. The other options, such as British ideas about social hierarchy and Eighteenth century scientific racism, do not have as strong an impact on the content of the poem as The First Great Awakening does.",
