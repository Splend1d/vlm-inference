P decreases by a factor of 16.\nB. P decreases by a factor of 4.\nC. P decreases by a factor of 2.\nD. P increases by a factor of 4.\n\nassistant:The answer is C. P decreases by a factor of 2.\n\nWhen the temperature of an ideal gas is increased by a factor of 2, the kinetic energy of the gas particles increases. This means that the gas particles will move faster and more frequently collide with the walls of the container, exerting more pressure on the walls.\n\nHowever, when the volume of the gas is increased by a factor of 8, the gas particles have more space to move around and collide with the walls less frequently. This means that the pressure exerted by the gas on the walls is reduced.\n\nThe change in pressure can be calculated using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nIf we rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for P, we get:\n\nP = nRT/V\n\nSince the volume is increased by a factor of 8, the new pressure is:\n\nP_new = nRT/V_new = (nRT)/8V\n\nThe original pressure P is:\n\nP = nRT/V\n\nTo find the change in pressure, we subtract the original pressure from the new pressure:\n\n\u0394P = P_new - P = (nRT)/8V - nRT/V\n\nThe factor of 8 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:\n\n\u0394P = (nRT)/V\n\nThis shows that the pressure decreases as the volume increases, which is why the answer is C. P decreases by a factor of 2.",
