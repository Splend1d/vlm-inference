How long is a solar day on Planet X?\n\nA. About 10 earth days\nB. About 100 earth days\nC. About 200 earth days\nD. There is no solar day Planet X is tidally locked\n\nassistant:Step 1: Identify the information related to a solar day on Planet X.\n- Planet X has a sidereal day of 100 Earth days.\n\nStep 2: Understand the relationship between a sidereal day and a solar day.\n- A sidereal day is the time it takes for a planet to rotate once around its axis.\n- A solar day is the time it takes for a planet to go through one complete orbit around its sun.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference between the sidereal day and the solar day.\n- Solar day = sidereal day - rotation period (Planet X rotates once in 100 Earth days)\n- Solar day = 100 Earth days - 100 Earth days = 0 Earth days\n\nStep 4: Determine the duration of a solar day on Planet X.\n- Solar day = 0 Earth days (already calculated in Step 3)\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated solar day duration with the given options.\n- Solar day = 0 Earth days (Option D: There is no solar day Planet X is tidally locked)\n\nThe answer is D. There is no solar day on Planet X, as it is tidally locked.",
