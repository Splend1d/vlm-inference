This is because caribou were a common food source for many indigenous peoples in the region, and the presence of large numbers of caribou bones at the site suggests that they were a significant part of the diet. While it is possible that the climate was colder during that time, there is not enough evidence to support this as the main implication. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that caribou were imported into the United States from Canada, and there is no direct connection between the presence of caribou bones and the cholesterol levels of the people who lived at the site.",
