The t-distributions are symmetric, just like the normal distribution.\n\nB. This statement is true. The t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, which makes them more spread out than the normal distribution.\n\nC. This statement is false. The t-distributions are not closer to the normal distribution as the degree of freedom (df) increases. Instead, the t-distributions become more peaked as the df increases.\n\nD. This statement is true. The 68-95-99.7 Rule works well for t-models with small df values.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\nC. The greater the df, the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution.",
