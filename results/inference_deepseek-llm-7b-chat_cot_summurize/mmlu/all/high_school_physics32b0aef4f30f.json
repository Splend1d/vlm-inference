The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g/(kA).\nD. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g/(kA).\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g].\n\nWhen the block is at the equilibrium position, the net force acting on the block is zero. The spring force and the gravitational force acting on the block are equal and opposite. Therefore, the block is at rest.\n\nWhen the small block is placed on top of the original block, the total mass of the system increases, and the gravitational force acting on the system also increases. However, the spring constant remains the same, so the restoring force of the spring also increases.\n\nIf the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g], the block will not slide off as long as the friction is greater than the restoring force due to the spring. So, the correct answer is B.",
