The widower had two children, a son and a daughter. After the daughter married, she and her husband lived on the farm in a small cottage. From 1985 to 1989, the daughter and the husband helped the widower farm and maintain the property. The widower, whose health was deteriorating, needed the services of the daughter and her husband in order to continue to live on the farm. In December 1989, the daughter told the widower that she and her husband were planning to move out of state. Worried that he could not survive without their help, the widower said to the daughter, \"Please don't ever leav. e. I'm totally dependent on you and your husband. If you stay and continue to care for me and help with the farming, the farm will be yours when I die. \" The daughter turned down a job offer in a neighboring state and decided to do as the widower requested. For nine years, the daughter cared for her father while her husband handled most of the farming operations. In 1998, the widower died intestate with the daughter and the son as his only surviving heirs. The period required to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is seven years. In an appropriate action to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son, respectively, in the farm, the result will depend upon the application of the principles of and exceptions to the\n\nA. statute of frauds.\nB. parol evidence rule.\nC. law for adverse possession.\nD. doctrine of resulting trusts.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. law for adverse possession.\n\nIn this situation, the daughter and the son are both heirs of the 73-year-old widower, and they have different rights and interests in the 40-acre farm. The daughter has been caring for her father and helping with the farming operations for nine years, and the widower promised to give the farm to her if she continued to care for him and help with the farming. The son, on the other hand, has not been involved in the farming operations or the care of his father.\n\nThe law for adverse possession is relevant in this case because it determines the rights of the daughter and the son in the farm. Adverse possession is a legal concept that allows a person who has occupied and used another person's property without the owner's consent for a certain period of time to acquire legal title to the property. In this case, the daughter has been living and working on the farm for nine years, which is longer than the period required to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction (seven years). If the daughter can prove that she has been in possession of the farm for the required period of time, she may be able to acquire legal title to the property.\n\nOn the other hand, the son has not been involved in the farming operations or the care of his father, which means that he has not established any claim to the farm under the law of adverse possession. Therefore, the result of the action to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son in the farm will depend on the application of the principles of and exceptions to the law for adverse possession, as well as other relevant legal principles such as the statute of frauds and the parol evidence rule (which are not relevant in this case).",
