Scenario 1 | I ripped off the merchant. Scenario 2 | I drank vodka during halftime of the big game.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character (who uses \"I/me/my\") rips off the merchant, which means they commit theft. Theft is generally considered morally wrong, and it violates the norms of honesty and fair dealing.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character drinks vodka during halftime of the big game. While this may not be the most responsible behavior, it is not morally wrong in itself. Drinking alcohol is legal for adults in the US, and many people engage in moderate alcohol consumption for social or recreational purposes. Therefore, this action does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
