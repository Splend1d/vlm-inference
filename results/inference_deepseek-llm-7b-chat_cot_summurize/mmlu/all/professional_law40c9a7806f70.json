At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant.\nB. No, because the lease was oral.\nC. Yes, because they were accessions.\nD. Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n\nassistant:The removal by the tenant was proper. The tenant's actions were based on the classification of the appliances and air-conditioning system as \"accessions,\" which are defined as fixtures that are attached to or used in conjunction with the land. Since the appliances and air-conditioning system were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise, the tenant had the right to remove them at the end of the lease term.\n\nIn this case, the tenant's removal of the appliances and air-conditioning system was not improper because the lease was oral, or because the landlord was a holdover tenant. These factors do not affect the tenant's rights to remove accessions at the end of the lease term.",
