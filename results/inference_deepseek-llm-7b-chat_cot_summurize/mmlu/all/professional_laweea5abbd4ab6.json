Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.\nD. Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video.\n\nassistant:The mother may be likely to prevail in her lawsuit against the television station for invasion of her privacy and that of her son. The factors that weigh in her favor include:\n\n1. The mother did not give permission for the video to be used in the program.\n2. The mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of seeing the video.\n\nWhile a person does not have a right to privacy after their death, this factor is unlikely to be a significant factor in this case. Additionally, the fact that the street was open to the public may be a defense, but it is not enough to prevent the mother from prevailing on the other two grounds. Therefore, the answer is C. Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.",
