This work has been labelled ______.\n\nA. developmental epigenetics\nB. social epigenetics\nC. fetal epigenetics\nD. maternal epigenetics\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. social epigenetics.\n\nThe research from Moshe Szyf and colleagues focused on the epigenetic influences of prenatal maternal stress. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur without a change in the underlying DNA sequence. Maternal stress during pregnancy can lead to epigenetic changes in the fetus, which can have long-lasting effects on the child's health and development.\n\nSocial epigenetics is a subfield of epigenetics that examines the role of social factors, such as parental stress, in the regulation of gene expression. This research area has found that exposure to environmental stressors during critical periods of development can lead to long-lasting changes in gene expression that affect health and disease risk.\n\nDevelopmental epigenetics (A) and fetal epigenetics (C) are related fields, but they focus on the role of epigenetics in development and the fetus, respectively. Maternal epigenetics (D) is not the correct answer because the research from Szyf and colleagues focused on the epigenetic influences of maternal stress, not maternal epigenetics.",
