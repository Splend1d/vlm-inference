Statement 2| DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:A. True, True\n\nStatement 1 is true. Highway networks, which were introduced in 2015, are a variant of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that incorporate a mechanism called \"residual memory\" to improve the efficiency and speed of information processing. They were introduced after ResNets, which were first introduced in 2016. ResNets, in turn, were introduced after the widespread use of max pooling in CNNs.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. DenseNets, which were introduced in 2015, are a type of CNN architecture that uses dense connections between layers, meaning that each layer is connected to every other layer. This can result in the network requiring more memory than ResNets, which use smaller, more efficient connections between layers.",
