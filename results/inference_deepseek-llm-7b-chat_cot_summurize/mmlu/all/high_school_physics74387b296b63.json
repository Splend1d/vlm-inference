Particle A has a net charge of 2Q, and B has a net charge of Q. The ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is\n\nA. 4:01\nB. 2:01\nC. 1:01\nD. 1:02\n\nassistant:The electric force between two point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law, which states that the force between two charges is proportional to the product of their charges, the distance between them, and the inverse square of the distance between them.\n\nMathematically, Coulomb's law is given by:\n\nF = (k \\* Q\\_A \\* Q\\_B) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force between the two charges, k is the electrostatic constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), Q\\_A and Q\\_B are the charges of the two particles, and r is the distance between them.\n\nIn this case, the charges are Q and 2Q for particles A and B, respectively, and the distance between them is 4 m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nF = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2 \\* Q \\* (2Q)) / (4^2)\n\nF = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2 \\* 3Q) / 16\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the electric forces on particles A and B:\n\nRatio = F\\_A / F\\_B = (3Q) / Q\n\nSimplifying the ratio, we get:\n\nRatio = 3 / 1\n\nRatio = 3 : 1\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on particle A to that on particle B is 3:1, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
