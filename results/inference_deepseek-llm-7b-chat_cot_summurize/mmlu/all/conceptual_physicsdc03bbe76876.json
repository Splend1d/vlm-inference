None of these\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's consider the force acting on the tin can when it is whirled in a horizontal circle.\n\nStep 1: Identify the forces acting on the tin can\nWhen the tin can is whirled in a horizontal circle, there are two forces acting on it: the force of friction between the can and the surface it's moving on, and the centripetal force.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the forces\nThe force of friction acts in the opposite direction of the motion of the can, which is in a circle. This means that the force of friction acts inward. The centripetal force acts along the radius of the circle and is directed outward, away from the center of the circle.\n\nStep 3: Determine the net force\nTo find the net force on the can, we need to add the two forces together. The net force will be the difference between the sum of the inward force (friction) and the outward force (centripetal force).\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nThe net force on the can acts outward, which corresponds to option B.",
