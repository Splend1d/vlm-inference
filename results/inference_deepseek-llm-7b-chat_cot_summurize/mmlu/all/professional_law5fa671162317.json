After this agreement was executed and before delivery, the buyer and the manufacturer agreed in a telephone conversation to change the quantity term from 1,000 to 800 gidgets. This modification is probably unenforceable, because\n\nA. it violates the statute of frauds.\nB. there was no consideration.\nC. the original contract was in writing.\nD. the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. it violates the statute of frauds.\n\nThe statute of frauds is a law that requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, the contract involved the sale of a specific number of gidgets, which is a tangible item. The original contract was for 1,000 gidgets, and the subsequent telephone conversation changed the quantity to 800 gidgets. Since the statute of frauds requires that a contract for the sale of goods worth more than a certain amount (the amount varies by jurisdiction) be in writing, this modification is probably unenforceable.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. there was no consideration - This is not a valid reason for unenforceability. Consideration is not a requirement for the enforceability of a contract.\nC. the original contract was in writing - This is not a valid reason for unenforceability. The statute of frauds applies to contracts that are not in writing, not contracts that are in writing.\nD. the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms - This is not a valid reason for unenforceability. The parol evidence rule does not apply to the modification of a written contract.",
