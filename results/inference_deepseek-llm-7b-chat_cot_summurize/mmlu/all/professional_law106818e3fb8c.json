The resident has standing to bring the suit because the licensing statute directly affects him and his commercial fishing activities. The statute's requirement for nonresident fishermen to pay a higher fee is likely a burden on interstate commerce, which is a matter of federal jurisdiction. The federal court should hear the case and determine if the statute is constitutional. The other options are incorrect because the resident has standing to bring the suit, and the case involves a question of federal jurisdiction, not state law.",
