Virtue ethics focuses on the development and practice of virtues, or moral character traits, as the basis for moral action. Aristotle believed that individuals should strive to become morally virtuous and that these virtues would lead to a fulfilling and just life. In contrast, consequentialism (B) focuses on the outcomes of actions, and rights-based theory (C) focuses on protecting and upholding individual rights. Utilitarianism (D) emphasizes maximizing overall happiness or utility. While Aristotle's moral theory has some elements in common with consequentialism and utilitarianism, it is primarily rooted in the idea of cultivating virtues in individuals.",
