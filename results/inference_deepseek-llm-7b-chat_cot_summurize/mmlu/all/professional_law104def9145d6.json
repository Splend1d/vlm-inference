Thereafter, a defendant was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification.\nB. admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.\n\nassistant:The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony as admissible as a prior identification. This is because the correction officer is testifying about what he saw when the defendant was first brought to jail, which is relevant to the issue of whether the defendant had red hair at the time of the alleged armed robbery. The testimony is not hearsay and is not opinion testimony, so options C and D are incorrect. Option B is not correct because the purpose of the testimony is not to clarify a discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony, but rather to establish a prior consistent identification of the defendant. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
