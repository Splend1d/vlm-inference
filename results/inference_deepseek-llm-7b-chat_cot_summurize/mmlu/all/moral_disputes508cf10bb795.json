So, in the same way, if someone gives you something, like a car or a toy, they have a right to get it back when they want it. That's why John has a duty to return the car to Mary.\n\nThe other choices are not about duties that correspond to rights. For example, John not hurting Mary or not committing suicide is about being kind and taking care of himself, but it doesn't have to do with something he gave or received from Mary.",
