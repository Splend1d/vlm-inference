Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans must have occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa.\n\nThis is because if Neandertals had interbred with modern humans after migrating out of Africa, it would be expected that some of their DNA would have been passed on to modern humans in Africa. However, since no Neandertal DNA is found in modern Africans, it is likely that the gene flow occurred before Neandertals left Africa.",
