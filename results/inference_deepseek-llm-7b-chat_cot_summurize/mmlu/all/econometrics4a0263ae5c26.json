(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's analyze each characteristic one by one and check which of them are characteristics of a stationary process.\n\ni) It crosses its mean value frequently: This characteristic describes a random walk, which is not a stationary process. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nii) It has constant mean and variance: This characteristic describes a stationary process. A stationary process has a constant mean and variance over time. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\niii) It contains no trend component: A trend component means that the process changes over time. A stationary process does not have any trend component. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\niv) It will be stationary in first difference form: When a process is first differenced, it becomes stationary. Therefore, this option is also correct.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that (ii) and (iii) are the characteristics of a stationary process. Hence, the answer is C.
