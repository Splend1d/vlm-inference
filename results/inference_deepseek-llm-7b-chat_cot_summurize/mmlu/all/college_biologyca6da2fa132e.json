A given prey organism is less likely to undergo a population surge.\n\nThis is because the quote mentions that the ecosystem becomes \"simplified\" and that the \"stabilizing influences of density-dependent regulatory factors\" are disrupted. Density-dependent regulatory factors refer to the relationship between population density and the growth rate of a species. For example, if a species has a high population density, the birth rate will be higher than the death rate, leading to an increase in population size. However, if the density of a species is high enough, it can cause negative effects on the environment, such as overgrazing, and lead to a decrease in population size.\n\nIn a disturbed ecosystem, the population density of a species may be higher than in a natural ecosystem. However, due to the disruption of stabilizing influences of density-dependent regulatory factors, the population of that species may not decrease as much, leading to a less likely population surge.",
