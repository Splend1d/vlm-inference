Building low fences on the sand dunes\n\nassistant:B. Minimizing artificial lighting in the area is the most environmentally sound practice around sea turtle nest sites. This is because artificial lighting can confuse hatchling sea turtles and cause them to head towards inland areas instead of towards the sea. This can lead to many of the turtles dying due to dehydration or predation. Therefore, it is important to minimize artificial lighting in the area to help the turtles orient correctly towards the sea.",
