The invoice was paid August 13. The store paid\n\nA. $7,140 \nB. $7,000 \nC. $6,860 \nD. $6,300\n\nassistant:To calculate the amount the store paid, we need to consider the terms of the invoice and the time it was paid.\n\nThe invoice was for $7,000 and was purchased on August 4. The terms of the invoice are 2/10, which means a 2% discount is offered if paid within 10 days. The store paid on August 13, which is 19 days after the invoice was purchased.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of the discount. The discount is calculated as 2% of $7,000, which is:\n\n$7,000 \\* 0.02 = $140\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount the store paid for the sofas. Since the store paid within 10 days, they are eligible for the 2% discount:\n\n$7,000 - $140 = $6,860\n\nSo, the store paid $6,860 for the sofas. The correct answer is C.",
