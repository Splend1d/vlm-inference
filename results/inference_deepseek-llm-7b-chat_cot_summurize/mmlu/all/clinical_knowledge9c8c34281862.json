Always 1:1.\n\nIn a double-stranded DNA molecule, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is always 1:1. The purines are adenine and guanine, and the pyrimidines are cytosine and thymine. The base pairing between the purines and pyrimidines ensures that the ratio remains constant throughout the DNA molecule.",
