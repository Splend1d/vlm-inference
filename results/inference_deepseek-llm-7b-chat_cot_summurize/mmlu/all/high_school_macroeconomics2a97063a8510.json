This puts upward pressure on the nominal interest rate, as the central bank needs to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control. When the central bank raises interest rates, the cost of borrowing money increases, which can lead to a decrease in consumer spending and an increase in saving.\n\nOption A is not necessarily true. While saving more may be a prudent response to inflation, it does not directly address the issue of increasing inflation.\n\nOption B is also not necessarily true. The velocity of money is a measure of how many times a dollar is exchanged in a given period, and it is influenced by a variety of factors, including inflation expectations. However, it is not a direct cause of inflation.\n\nOption D is not necessarily true. Inflation and the real interest rate are related, but they are not directly proportional. An increase in inflation can put downward pressure on the real interest rate, but it does not guarantee that it will.",
