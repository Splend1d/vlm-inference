For which of the following theories is the mother's behavior an exemplary application?\n\nA. Cannon-Bard\nB. instinct\nC. drive reduction\nD. incentive\n\nassistant:The mother's behavior can be best exemplified by the theory of drive reduction. This theory, proposed by psychologist David McClelland, suggests that individuals have innate drives or needs that motivate them to achieve specific goals. In this case, Al has two drives: the drive for competence (to do well in school) and the drive for status (to have enough money for a car). By giving him money for good grades, Al's mother is providing him with an incentive to satisfy his drive for competence, which in turn will help him achieve his drive for status. This is an example of drive reduction, as the mother is helping Al reduce the intensity of his drives by providing him with the means to satisfy them.",
