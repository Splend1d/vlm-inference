The evidence is admissible due to the factual similarity with the present charge, which gives the evidence strong probative value.\n\nassistant:The court is most likely to rule that the evidence is too prejudicial and must be excluded. This is because the defense counsel argues that the prejudicial effect of the evidence (the man's prior convictions) outweighs its probative value (the similarity of the man's modus operandi in the current case and the past cases). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not specifically address this issue, but the court may consider the balance of probative value and prejudicial effect when making a decision.",
