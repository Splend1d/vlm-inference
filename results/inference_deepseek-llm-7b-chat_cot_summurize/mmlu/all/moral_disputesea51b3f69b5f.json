He believes that in a ticking bomb scenario, torture is permissible because it could prevent a greater loss of life. Additionally, he believes that no democratic society should allow public officials to engage in illegal actions \"off the books,\" as this undermines the rule of law. Finally, he argues that \"torture warrants\" should be part of a legal system regulating the practice of torture, as this would provide transparency and accountability in the use of torture.",
