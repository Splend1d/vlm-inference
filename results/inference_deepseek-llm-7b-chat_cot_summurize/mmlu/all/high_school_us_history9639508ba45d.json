Debates over the procedures of amending the Constitution.\n\nassistant:The passage by Martin Luther King, Jr., from his \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\" on April 16, 1963, demonstrates continuity in U.S. history regarding debates over voting rights. The language of this passage highlights the importance of standing up for justice and equality, regardless of one's location, and emphasizes the interconnectedness of communities and states. The passage also criticizes the idea of living with the \"narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea,\" suggesting that individuals should be concerned about injustices happening in other parts of the country, not just in their own community.\n\nThe passage does not specifically address debates over free speech, federal power and states' rights, or the procedures of amending the Constitution. However, the emphasis on the importance of voting rights, the interconnectedness of communities and states, and the call for justice and equality are all closely related to debates over voting rights and civil rights in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Debates over voting rights.",
