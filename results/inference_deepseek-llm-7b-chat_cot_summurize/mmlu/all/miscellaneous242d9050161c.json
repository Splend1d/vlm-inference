In the sentence above, the underlined portion can best be described as\n\nA. an adjective clause\nB. a relative clause\nC. a subordinate clause\nD. an independent clause\n\nassistant:B. a relative clause\n\nExplanation: The underlined portion \"Whenever the mood strikes her\" is a relative clause in the sentence. It functions as a complement to the noun \"walk\" and provides additional information about when Angela takes the walk.\n\nA relative clause is a type of subordinate clause that functions as a modifier of a noun or pronoun in the sentence. It typically begins with a relative pronoun, such as \"who\", \"which\", \"that\", \"whose\", \"where\", \"why\", or \"when\". In this case, \"whenever\" is the relative pronoun.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an adjective clause is a dependent clause that functions as an adjective to modify a noun in the sentence. In this case, there is no noun being modified by the clause.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a subordinate clause is a dependent clause that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. In this case, the relative clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.\n\nOption D is incorrect because an independent clause is a type of sentence that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete sentence. In this case, the relative clause is not an independent clause because it cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.",
