Larceny and burglary.\n\nassistant:The defendant will most likely be convicted of both larceny and attempted burglary.\n\nThe defendant entered the fenced-in back yard of the building, attempting to pry open the back window of the grocery store, which is an act of burglary. However, the defendant was interrupted by the husband before he could actually gain entry into the store, which means that the attempted burglary did not succeed. At the same time, the defendant stole the money from the cigar box inside the store, which is an act of larceny. Therefore, the defendant will most likely be convicted of both larceny and attempted burglary.",
