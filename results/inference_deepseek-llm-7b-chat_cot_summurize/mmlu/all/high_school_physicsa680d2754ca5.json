Earth\u2019s radius is 6,400 km. Which of the following is the best estimate of the textbook\u2019s weight on a mountain peak located 6,000 m above sea level?\n\nA. 60 N\nB. 15 N\nC. 30 N\nD. 7.5 N\n\nassistant:To find the best estimate of the textbook's weight on a mountain peak, we can use the following equation:\n\nWeight = Weight at sea level \u00d7 (Rearrange to weight at sea level)\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation to find the weight at sea level:\nWeight = Weight at sea level \u00d7 (Rearrange to pressure)\n\nNext, let's find the atmospheric pressure at sea level and on the mountain peak. The atmospheric pressure is inversely proportional to the altitude. Therefore, we can find the pressure on the mountain peak by dividing the pressure at sea level by the change in altitude:\n\nPressure at sea level = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\nPressure at mountain peak = (1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa) / 6,000 m = 1.667 \u00d7 10^3 Pa\n\nNow, we can use the equation to find the weight at the mountain peak:\nWeight at mountain peak = 30 N \u00d7 (1.667 \u00d7 10^3 Pa / (1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa)) = 1.667 \u00d7 10^3 N\n\nThe closest answer to the best estimate of the textbook's weight on the mountain peak is 15 N (option B).",
