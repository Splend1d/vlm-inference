If there are 35 problems on the test, what is the greatest number you can miss and still pass?\n\nA. 7\nB. 28\nC. 35\nD. 8\n\nassistant:To find the greatest number you can miss and still pass, we need to set up an inequality. \n\nLet x be the number of problems you can miss and still pass. Then, (35 - x) is the number of problems you need to answer correctly to pass. \n\nWe know that the number of problems you need to answer correctly must be at least 80% of the total number of problems. \n\nTherefore, we have the inequality:\n\n(35 - x) >= 0.8(35)\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n(35 - x) >= 28\n\nx >= 35 - 28\n\nx >= 7\n\nSo, the greatest number you can miss and still pass is 7. Therefore, the answer is A.",
