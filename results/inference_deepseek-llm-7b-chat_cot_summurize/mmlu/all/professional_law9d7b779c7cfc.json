Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\n\nThe sisters are correct in asserting that the son holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself. As tenants in common, the son has a fiduciary duty to his sisters to act in their best interests and manage the farm in a manner that benefits all three of them equally. The fact that the mortgage was secured before the tenancy in common was created does not negate the fiduciary relationship that exists among the siblings.",
