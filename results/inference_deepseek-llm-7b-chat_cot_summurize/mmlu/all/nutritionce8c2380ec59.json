Result in bone mineral loss from the skeleton.\n\nDuring pregnancy and lactation, a woman's body goes through various changes to support the growth and development of the fetus and the production of breast milk. One of the key changes is an increased demand for calcium, which is essential for fetal growth and bone development.\n\nTo meet this increased demand, the mother's body draws upon her own calcium stores. Over time, this can lead to a decrease in bone mineral content and an increased risk of developing osteoporosis later in life. In fact, studies have shown that women who have given birth and/or breastfed have a lower bone mineral density compared to non-pregnant, non-lactating women.\n\nFurthermore, while lactating, the mother's body may also experience a temporary decrease in calcium absorption due to the production of certain hormones and changes in gut microbiota. This can further contribute to the depletion of calcium stores.\n\nIt is important for pregnant and lactating women to maintain adequate calcium intake to support their own health and the development of their fetus or baby. Calcium-rich foods such as dairy products, leafy green vegetables, and fortified foods can help meet these needs. However, it is also crucial for these women to consult with healthcare providers to ensure that their calcium intake is adequate and appropriate for their individual circumstances.",
