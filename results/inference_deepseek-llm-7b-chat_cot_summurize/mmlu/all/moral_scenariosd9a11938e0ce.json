Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character does something clearly morally wrong by deleting their roommate's essay without their consent. This action violates the roommate's intellectual property and can have serious consequences, such as academic repercussions or even legal action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character runs over a speed bump while driving. While this may not be the most cautious or responsible action, it does not cross the threshold of moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
