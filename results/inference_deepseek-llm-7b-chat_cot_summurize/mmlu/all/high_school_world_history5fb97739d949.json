Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics\n\nassistant:The text provided is from Publius Cornelius Tacitus' \"Germania,\" written around 98 C.E. It describes the interactions between the Romans and various Germanic tribes, specifically the Chamavi and Angrivarii, and the eventual extermination of the Tencteri and Bructeri by these tribes. The passage does not mention any specific factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Therefore, based on the information given in the text, it is difficult to definitively determine which of the options contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire.",
