We can use these values to find P(B | A) and P(B | \u00acA).\n\nFirst, we find P(B | A):\n\nP(B | A) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(A) = (1/4) / (1/2) = 1/2\n\nNext, we find P(B | \u00acA):\n\nP(B | \u00acA) = P(\u00acA \u2229 B) / P(\u00acA) = (1/4) / (1 - 1/2) = 1/4\n\nNow, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A | B):\n\nP(A | B) = (1/2) * (1/2) / (1/3) = (1/2) * (2/3) / (1/3) = 1\n\nSo, P(A | B) = 1, which corresponds to answer option D.",
