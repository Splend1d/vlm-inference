Both of these\nD. Neither of these\n\nassistant:A step-up transformer in an electrical circuit can step up voltage. The transformer increases the voltage of the input supply, making it suitable for powering devices that require higher voltage. The energy output remains the same, so option B is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is A: voltage.",
