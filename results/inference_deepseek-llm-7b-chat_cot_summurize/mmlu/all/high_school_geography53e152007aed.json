Abject poverty\nB. Better job and higher wages\nC. India's caste system\nD. Violence in her neighborhood\n\nassistant:Imagine you're Riva and you're moving from India to the United States. You need help deciding which of the options might make you want to move there. Here's what I can tell you:\n\nA. Abject poverty: This could be a reason to move if you're living in a very poor area and you want to improve your life.\nB. Better job and higher wages: If you think you'll have more opportunities and make more money in the United States, that could be a good reason to move.\nC. India's caste system: This is more about the way things are done in India, not the United States. So it wouldn't be a reason to move there.\nD. Violence in her neighborhood: If you're worried about being safe in your current neighborhood, moving to a safer place in the United States could be a good idea.\n\nSo, based on these explanations, I'd say that better job and higher wages (option B) would be a \"pull\" factor for Riva when considering a move from India to the United States.",
