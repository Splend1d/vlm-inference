Economic, Overuse of resources, Overpopulation, Over pollution.\n\nThe question is asking for the perspective on sustainability that resulted from growth models that analyzed the carrying capacity of the planet. These models concluded that the finite capacity of the earth and overuse of resources, overpopulation, and over pollution by current and past generations could reduce the quality of life for future generations. This perspective contrasts with the environmental perspective, which focuses on the need to maintain and preserve the natural environment.",
