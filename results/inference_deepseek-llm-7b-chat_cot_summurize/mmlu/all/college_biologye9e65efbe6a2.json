In proper order (inside to outside), what tissues and tissue regions would the larvae encounter as they eat their way toward the outside of the twig? (For simplicity, assume that the epidermis has already fallen off completely.)\n\nA. Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; primary phloem; secondary phloem; cortex\nB.

Pith; secondary xylem; primary xylem; vascular cambium; primary phloem; secondary phloem; cortex\nD. Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; secondary phloem; primary phloem; cortex\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Pith; secondary xylem; primary xylem; vascular cambium; primary phloem; secondary phloem; cortex.\n\nThe larvae would encounter the pith, which is the central, spongy tissue of the twig, first. They would then move into the secondary xylem, the secondary phloem, and primary phloem. The vascular cambium, which is the tissue that produces the secondary xylem and phloem, is encountered as the larvae continue to eat their way towards the outside of the twig. Finally, the larvae would reach the cortex, which is the outer protective layer of the twig.",
