Specific heat\nB. Thermal conductivity\nC. Electrical resistivity\nD. Hall coefficient\n\nassistant:The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a measure of the charge carrier concentration in a semiconductor, and the sign of the charge carriers can be determined based on whether the Hall coefficient is positive or negative. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Hall coefficient.",
