However, if a law passed by Congress conflicts with a previous law, the Constitution grants Congress the power to \"override\" that earlier law, effectively making the newer law take precedence over the older one. This power is derived from Article I, Section 7 of the United States Constitution, which states that \"all Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\" This clause establishes the legislative branch's authority to override previous laws, as Congress has the power to pass new laws that supersede existing ones.",
