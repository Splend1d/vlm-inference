Disgust for barbarian peoples\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n\nassistant:The views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of Disgust for barbarian peoples (Option A). In the excerpt, Tacitus describes the Tencteri, Bructeri, Chamavi, and Angrivarii as \"tyranny\" and \"barbarians.\" He also mentions that the Roman Empire was able to \"exterminate\" these tribes, and that he prays for them to have hatred for each other. These descriptions and sentiments indicate a sense of disgust for these barbarian peoples.\n\nOption B, Concern about barbarian attacks, is not supported by the excerpt. While Tacitus mentions that the Roman Empire was able to drive out and exterminate the barbarian tribes, he does not express any concern about future attacks from these tribes.\n\nOption C, Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy, is not supported by the excerpt. Tacitus's descriptions of the barbarian tribes do not indicate a lack of Stoicism among the Roman aristocracy.\n\nOption D, Maintenance of large armies, is not directly addressed in the excerpt. While Tacitus does mention the Roman Empire's ability to drive out and exterminate the barbarian tribes, this does not necessarily indicate a need for large armies.",
