He felt that Parliament had the right to increase taxes on the colonies.\nD. He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n\nassistant:The answer is A. He felt that the Crown needed to control trade and raise revenue.\n\nIn the excerpt, it is stated that \"Whereas it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this kingdom, and for extending and securing the navigation and commerce between Great Britain and your Majesty's dominions in America...\" This indicates that Prime Minister Grenville, after the French and Indian War, believed that the Crown needed to control trade and raise revenue, which is mentioned in option A.\n\nOption B, \"He felt that the colonists should help pay the debt incurred by the war,\" is consistent with the excerpt, as it states that \"it is just and necessary, that a revenue be raised, in your Majesty's said dominions in America, for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same...\"\n\nOption C, \"He felt that Parliament had the right to increase taxes on the colonies,\" is also supported by the excerpt, as it mentions that \"we, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of Great Britain, in parliament assembled, being desirous to make some provision, in this present session of parliament, towards raising the said revenue in America...\"\n\nOption D, \"He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of 'salutary neglect,'\" is not supported by the excerpt, as there is no mention of extending a reward or an extension of 'salutary neglect' in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the view that does NOT represent the views of Prime Minister Grenville after the French and Indian War is that he felt that the Crown needed to control trade and raise revenue, as stated in option A.",
