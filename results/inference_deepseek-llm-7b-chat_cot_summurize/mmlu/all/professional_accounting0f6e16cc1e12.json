Charging all costs to expense when incurred.\nB. Capitalizing all costs when incurred.\nC. Capitalizing costs specified by management and charging all other costs to expense.\nD. Accumulating all costs in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the existence of future benefits can be determined.\n\nassistant:B. Capitalizing all costs when incurred.\n\nJustification:\nA method that charges all costs to expense when incurred would not account for research and development (R&D) costs with no alternative future use. This would result in an immediate expense, which is not suitable for R&D costs.\n\nOption C suggests capitalizing costs specified by management and charging all other costs to expense. However, this method is too specific and may not account for all R&D costs.\n\nOption D suggests accumulating all costs in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the existence of future benefits can be determined. This method is more suitable for intangible assets, but it may not be the most appropriate choice for R&D costs.\n\nOption B suggests capitalizing all costs when incurred. This method is the most appropriate for R&D costs with no alternative future use, as it allows for the recognition of these costs as assets on the balance sheet and provides a more accurate reflection of the company's financial position.",
