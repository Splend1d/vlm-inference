The store offers into evidence certified copies of court proceedings revealing that the plaintiff has filed three similar lawsuits in the last 18 months against other convenience stores, claiming food poisoning resulting from the purchase of food from those stores. These copies should be ruled\n\nA. inadmissible, because of the best evidence rule.\nB. inadmissible, because they are irrelevant to the present claim.\nC. inadmissible, because there is the danger of undue prejudice to the plaintiff, which outweighs the probative value of the evidence.\nD. admissible, because they establish a pattern of similar actions.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. admissible, because they establish a pattern of similar actions.\n\nThe best evidence rule generally prevents the admission of evidence that has been certified by a court if there is an equally reliable non-certified version of that evidence available. However, in this case, the copies of court proceedings offered by the store do not appear to be certified by a court, so the best evidence rule does not apply.\n\nThe store's copies of court proceedings are relevant to the present claim because they show a pattern of similar actions by the plaintiff, which could potentially undermine his claim that the chili in this particular hot dog caused his food poisoning.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the store's copies of court proceedings are indeed relevant to the present claim.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the danger of undue prejudice to the plaintiff does not necessarily outweigh the probative value of the evidence in this case. The store's copies of court proceedings may be relevant to the present claim, and the fact that the plaintiff has filed similar lawsuits in the past does not necessarily mean that the store is automatically liable for his food poisoning in this case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the copies of court proceedings are not certified by a court, and therefore the best evidence rule does not apply.",
