Lower Japanese household incomes will likely lead to a decrease in demand for U.S. exports to Japan. This is because households will have less money to spend on imported goods, and they will prioritize spending on essential items.\n\n2. A decrease in demand for U.S. exports to Japan will lead to a decrease in the demand for the dollar. This is because the dollar is the currency used in the U.S. transactions, and as demand for U.S. exports decreases, so will the demand for the dollar.\n\n3. With a decrease in demand for the dollar, the value of the dollar relative to the yen will also decrease. This is because the value of a currency is determined by the supply and demand for that currency. If there is less demand for the dollar, its value will decrease compared to the yen.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease.",
