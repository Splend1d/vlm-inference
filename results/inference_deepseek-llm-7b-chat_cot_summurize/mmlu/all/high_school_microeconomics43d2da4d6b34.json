For every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds. Based on this information,\n\nA. Ray pulls weeds, since he has absolute advantage in cooking.\nB. Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has absolute advantage in cooking.\nC. Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking.\nD. Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.\n\nassistant:To determine the answer, we need to calculate the number of weeds each person can pull in one hour.\n\nRay pulls 50 weeds in one hour of cooking, and Dorothy pulls 100 weeds in one hour of cooking.\n\nSince Ray has a higher absolute advantage in cooking, he can pull more weeds in one hour of cooking than Dorothy. Therefore, Ray pulls more weeds in general.\n\nHowever, we need to determine if Dorothy has a comparative advantage in cooking. To do this, we compare the number of hours it takes Ray to cook a meal with the number of hours it takes Dorothy to cook a meal.\n\nLet's assume it takes Ray 3 hours to cook a meal, and it takes Dorothy 2 hours to cook a meal.\n\nIn 3 hours, Ray can pull 50 weeds/hour x 3 hours = 150 weeds.\nIn 2 hours, Dorothy can pull 100 weeds/hour x 2 hours = 200 weeds.\n\nSince Dorothy takes less time to cook the meal, she has a comparative advantage in cooking. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Dorothy cooks, since she has a comparative advantage in cooking.",
