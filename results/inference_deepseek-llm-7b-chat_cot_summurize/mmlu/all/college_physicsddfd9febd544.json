The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton\u2019s trajectory is not affected.

The final x-momentum is mvx, where m is the mass of the proton, and vx is the x-component of its final velocity.\n\nThe electric and magnetic fields are conservative, so the final and initial kinetic energies are equal:\n\n(1/2)mvx^2 = (1/2)m(vy)^2 + V(sin(theta))\n\nwhere vy is the y-component of the proton's final velocity, and theta is the angle between the electric field and the proton's velocity.\n\nThe proton's initial y-momentum is 0, and the final y-momentum is my, where my is the y-component of its final momentum.\n\nUsing the conservation of energy, we can find the final velocity of the proton:\n\n(1/2)mvy^2 = (1/2)m(0)^2 + V(cos(theta))\nvy^2 = 2V(cos(theta))\nvy = sqrt(2V(cos(theta)))\n\nThe proton's final velocity is in the xy-plane, so we can find the angle between the electric field and the proton's velocity:\n\nsin(theta) = vy / vx\nsin(theta) = sqrt(2V(cos(theta))) / v\n\nThe proton's final velocity is in the xy-plane, so the angle between the electric field and the proton's velocity is 90 degrees. Therefore, theta = 90 degrees, and cos(90) = 0, which means that the proton's velocity is parallel to the magnetic field.\n\nSince the proton's velocity is parallel to the magnetic field, the electric field is not acting on the proton. Therefore, the proton's trajectory is not affected by the electric field.\n\nTherefore, the proton's trajectory is not affected by the electric field, and the answer is A. deflected in the +x-direction.",
