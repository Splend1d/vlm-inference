What is the student's average score for these six tests?\n\nA. 76\nB. 77\nC. 78\nD. 79\n\nassistant:To find the average score, you need to sum up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. The sum of the scores is 76 + 80 + 83 + 71 + 80 + 78 = 498. Since there are 6 tests, the average score is 498 / 6 = 83.\n\nThe answer is B. 77",
