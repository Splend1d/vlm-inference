If heartworm actually occurs in 10% of dogs, what is the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive for heartworm actually has heartworm?\n\nA. 11%\nB. 18%\nC. 84%\nD. 88%\n\nassistant:Let's denote the probability of a dog having heartworm as P(H) and the probability of a dog not having heartworm as P(\u00acH). We are given that 96% of dogs with heartworm test positive, so:\n\nP(H) = 0.96\nP(\u00acH) = 0.02\n\nWe are also given that 98% of dogs without heartworm test negative, so:\n\nP(\u00acH) = 0.98\n\nNow, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that a dog with a positive test result actually has heartworm. Bayes' theorem states:\n\nP(H|+1) = (P(+1|H) * P(H)) / P(+1)\n\nWe know P(+1|H) = 0.96, P(H) = 0.96, and we need to find P(+1).\n\nP(+1) = P(+1|H) * P(H) + P(+1|\u00acH) * P(\u00acH)\n\nP(+1|H) = 0.96\nP(H) = 0.96\nP(+1|\u00acH) = 1 - P(+1|H) = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04\nP(\u00acH) = 0.02\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nP(+1) = (0.96 * 0.96) + (0.04 * 0.02) = 0.864 + 0.0008 = 0.8648\n\nFinally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that a dog with a positive test result actually has heartworm:\n\nP(H|+1) = (0.96 * 0.96) / 0.8648 \u2248 0.987\n\nNone of the given options match this result.
