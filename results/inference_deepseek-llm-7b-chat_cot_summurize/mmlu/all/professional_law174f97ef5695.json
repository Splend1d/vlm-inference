The bystander's prior statement should only be used for impeachment purposes, to attack the witness's credibility. The admission of the prior statement into evidence should not affect the outcome of the trial. The judge should instruct the jury accordingly.\n\nOther options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Permitting the jury to consider the prior statement as substantive evidence would be inappropriate, as it is not reliable evidence.\n\nB. The defense is not entitled to call other witnesses to confirm the fact that the prior statement had been made. The defense is only entitled to cross-examine the bystander about the prior statement, and impeach the witness's credibility.\n\nC. Instructing the jury that the bystander's testimony that the defendant had driven through the red light should be disregarded would be inappropriate. The jury should consider all evidence in determining the outcome of the trial.",
