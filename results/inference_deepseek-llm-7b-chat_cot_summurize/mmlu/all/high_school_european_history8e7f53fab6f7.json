This is evident in the text, which states that Erasmus introduced the classic spirit among the people and made it more accessible to the educated classes, rather than just the upper classes. He aimed to offer a help to his readers in ornamenting their style and strengthening their argumentation, and he succeeded in familiarizing a much wider circle with the spirit of antiquity. Erasmus's sincere love for humanity and its general culture, as well as his desire to make the book of antiquity open to all, contributed to his greater impact and significance as a humanist.",
