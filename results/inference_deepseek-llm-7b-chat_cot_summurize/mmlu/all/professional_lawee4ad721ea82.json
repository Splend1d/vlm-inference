The defense motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.\nB. granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.\nC. denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.\nD. denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.\n\nThe police had reasonable suspicion to believe that a crime was being committed based on the information provided by the informant. This allowed them to install the eavesdropping device without obtaining a warrant or notifying the telephone company. Therefore, the taped conversation should be admissible as evidence at trial.\n\nA. is incorrect because the failure to obtain a warrant is not a valid basis for excluding the evidence.\nB. is incorrect because the telephone company was not involved in the installation of the eavesdropping device, and therefore, obtaining their approval was not relevant to the legality of the police's actions.\nC. is incorrect because the defendant's expectation of privacy is not the relevant issue in determining the admissibility of the evidence. The focus should be on whether the police had probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed.",
