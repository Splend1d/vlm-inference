To calculate the friend's recovery, we can use the following formula:\n\nRecovery = (1 - percentage of the friend's negligence) x friend's damages\n\nRecovery = (1 - 0.55) x $100,000\n\nRecovery = 0.45 x $100,000\n\nRecovery = $45,000\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of $45,000.\n\nSo, the answer is C. $45,000.00.",
