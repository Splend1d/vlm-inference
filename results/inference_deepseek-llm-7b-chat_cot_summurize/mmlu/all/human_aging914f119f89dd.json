Makes correct diagnoses difficult\n\nComorbidity is a problem for older adults because it makes correct diagnoses difficult. As people age, they are more likely to have multiple chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. These conditions can be difficult to diagnose and treat because they can have overlapping symptoms and because some medications may interact with each other in harmful ways. In addition, older adults may have difficulty communicating their symptoms to healthcare providers, which can further complicate the diagnostic process.",
