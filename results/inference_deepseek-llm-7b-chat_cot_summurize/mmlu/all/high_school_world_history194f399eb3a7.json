The correct answer is option D, which states \"Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism\". This option is the only one that makes sense in the context of the letter, as the author is complaining about the damage caused by the Zulu natives and suing the government for the damages. The other options do not fit the context of the letter or the situation described.",
