Drinking alcohol and driving is illegal and dangerous, and can result in injury or death to the driver, passengers, and others on the road.\n\nIn the second scenario (I slit open the bottom of the bag my kid brother was using to go trick-or-treating), the main character is not doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While it may be a mean or petty action, it does not involve any illegal or dangerous behavior that would result in harm to others.",
