This property prevents the water from separating into individual molecules even at low pressure. The strong adhesion property of water is not relevant in this context, as it refers to the attraction between water molecules. The high heat capacity of water and the strong cohesion property of cellulose in the xylem cell wall are also not the main factors responsible for holding the water molecules together in a vertical column of water in xylem vessels of a plant.",
