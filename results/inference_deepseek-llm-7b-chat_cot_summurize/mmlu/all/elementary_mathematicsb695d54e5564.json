If she counted a total of 76 birds, how many birds did she count in the afternoon?\n\nA. 21 birds\nB. 40 birds\nC. 42 birds\nD. 84 birds\n\nassistant:Let's represent the number of birds Keiko counted in the morning as x. Since she counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon, we can represent the number of birds she counted in the afternoon as x - 34. The total number of birds she counted is x + (x - 34) = 76.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 2x - 34 = 76. Adding 34 to both sides, we get 2x = 110. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 55. Therefore, Keiko counted 55 birds in the morning and 55 - 34 = 21 birds in the afternoon.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 21 birds.",
