You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The circle $2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20$ is inscribed inside a square which has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis. What is the area of the square?\n\nA. 80\nB. \\sqrt{20}\nC. 2\\sqrt{20}\nD. 20\n\nassistant:To answer this problem, we will first rewrite the given circle equation in standard form:\n\n2x^2 + 2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20 = 0\n\nNow, we will complete the square:\n\n2(x^2 + 6x/2) + 2(y^2 + 4y/2) + 12x - 4y + 20 = 0\n2(x^2 + 3x) + 2(y^2 + 2y) + 12x - 4y + 20 = 0\n(x^2 + 3x + 9/4) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) + 12x - 4y + 20 = 0\n(x + 3/2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + 12x - 4y + 20 = 0\n\nNow, we can complete the square for the y terms:\n\n(x + 3/2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = (x + 3/2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 + 20 = 0\n\nSo, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n(x + 3/2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\n\nNow, we can see that the circle is centered at (-3/2, -1) and has a radius of \u221a20.\n\nThe area of the square is equal to the area of the square with side length equal to the diameter of the circle (which is 2\u221a20).\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 2\\sqrt{20}.",
