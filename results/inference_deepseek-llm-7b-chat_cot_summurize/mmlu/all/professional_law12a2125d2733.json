Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection in order to be enforced.\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\nC. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\nD.

Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection in order to be enforced.\n\nUnder the doctrine of \"implied revocation,\" a revocation of an offer does not require explicit words of rejection. Instead, the courts will look at the actions of the offeree in determining whether a revocation has occurred. In this case, the purchasing agent's statement of financial crisis was enough to communicate a clear intention to revoke the offer. As a result, the seller would not prevail in court.",
