Honda separating its potential customers into economy car buyers and luxury car buyers.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. A garden nursery seeing residents of urban areas and rural areas as one market needing trees.\n\nThis is an example of a segmented market because the garden nursery has identified that residents of urban and rural areas have similar needs when it comes to gardening and trees, but may have different preferences or purchasing habits. For example, urban residents may have limited space for trees and may be more interested in small, low-maintenance trees, while rural residents may have more space and may be more interested in larger trees for shade or fruit production. By tailoring its marketing and product offerings to these different segments, the nursery can better meet the needs of each group and increase its sales.",
