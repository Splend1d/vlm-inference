How many students take tap lessons?\n\nA. 32\nB. 49\nC. 63\nD. 68\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students who take tap lessons. We are given that 4 over 9 take tap lessons, so we need to find 9/10 of the total number of students on the dance team.\n\nLet's represent the total number of students on the dance team as x.\n\n9/10 of x is equal to 4 over 9 of x.\n\n9/10 * x = 4/9 * x\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n9 * 4 = 10 * 4\n\n36 = 40\n\nThis equation is not true, which means there is a mistake in the given information or in the question. Please double-check the given information and try again.",
