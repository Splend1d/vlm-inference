What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\n\nA. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 7\nB. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 10\nC. E(X + Y) = 619, var(X + Y) = 14\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\n\nassistant:To find the expected value and variance of X + Y, we need to first find the expected value and variance of X and Y separately.\n\nE(X) = 312\nvar(X) = 6\n\nE(Y) = 307\nvar(Y) = 8\n\nThe expected value of X + Y can be found by adding the expected values of X and Y:\n\nE(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)\nE(X + Y) = 312 + 307\nE(X + Y) = 619\n\nNow, let's find the variance of X + Y. We can use the formula for the variance of a sum of random variables:\n\nvar(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2 * (cov(X, Y))\n\nSince we don't have information about the covariance between X and Y, we cannot calculate the exact variance of X + Y. However, we can express the variance in terms of the covariance:\n\nvar(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2 * (cov(X, Y))\n\nSince we don't have the covariance, we cannot determine the exact variance of X + Y. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.",
