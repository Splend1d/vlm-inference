Content validity refers to the extent to which the content of a test measures what it is supposed to measure. In this case, the examination lacks content validity because it only covers three specific areas of psychology, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the subject.\n\nThe other options are not relevant to this examination:\n\nB. predictive validity refers to the extent to which a test predicts future performance.\nC. test\u2013retest reliability refers to the consistency of test scores when the test is given multiple times under similar conditions.\nD. alternate-forms reliability refers to the extent to which different forms of a test measure the same concept.",
