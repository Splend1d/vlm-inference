In other words, we need to find a value for num1 that makes the expression num1 > num2 || num1 > num3 false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. num1 < num2. This is because if num1 is less than num2, the expression num1 > num2 will be false, and the entire condition num1 > num2 || num1 > num3 will also be false. This will make the while loop fail and the body of the loop will never be executed.\n\nThe other options are wrong because:\n\nB. num1 < num3: This will make the expression num1 > num2 || num1 > num3 true, and the body of the loop will be executed.\n\nC. num1 > num2 && num1 > num3: This will make the expression num1 > num2 || num1 > num3 true, and the body of the loop will be executed.\n\nD. num1 < num2 && num1 < num3: This will make the expression num1 > num2 || num1 > num3 true, and the body of the loop will be executed.",
