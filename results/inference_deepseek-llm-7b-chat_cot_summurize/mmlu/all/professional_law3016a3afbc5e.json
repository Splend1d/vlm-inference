However, the neighbor did not provide any consideration to keep the offer open for an extended period of time. After receiving the man's offer, the neighbor simply said, \"Let me think it over.\" This indicates that the neighbor was not ready to make a decision immediately, and did not provide any form of consideration to keep the offer open. Therefore, the man should not be held liable for breach of contract, and judgment should be in his favor.",
