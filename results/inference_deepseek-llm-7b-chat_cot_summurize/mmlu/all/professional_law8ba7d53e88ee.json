It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because of the doctrine of dependent covenants.\n\nThe seller's repudiation of the wheat contract does not affect the buyer's rights under the soybean contract. The two contracts are separate and independent of each other. The buyer is entitled to receive the soybeans under the contract they made with the seller, and the seller's failure to deliver the wheat does not affect the buyer's obligations under the soybean contract. The doctrine of dependent covenants, however, may allow the buyer to terminate the soybean contract if the seller's breach of the wheat contract was a material breach that would have prevented the buyer from performing under the soybean contract.",
