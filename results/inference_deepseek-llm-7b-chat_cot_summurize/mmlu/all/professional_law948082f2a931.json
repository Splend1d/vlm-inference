The gardener claims that the homeowner hired him to perform landscape work at his home. After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work.

The gardener claims that the homeowner agreed to pay him $200 for landscape work, while the homeowner claims to have agreed to pay only $100. The gardener's friend, who is now deceased, spoke both English and Japanese and served as an interpreter. The Dead Man's Statute is mentioned, which is a legal principle in some jurisdictions that prevents a deceased person from being a witness in a trial.\n\nOption A is not applicable because the homeowner's attorney has not admitted to anything.\n\nOption B is also not applicable because the gardener's friend is not alive to testify.\n\nOption D is not relevant because the gardener is not being questioned about whether he accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent.\n\nOption C is the correct answer. The gardener's proposed testimony is inadmissible due to the Dead Man's Statute. The statute may prevent the use of the gardener's friend's testimony to establish the terms of the contract.",
