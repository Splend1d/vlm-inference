This is because our brains are able to recognize and maintain a consistent perception of the shape of an object, even when its appearance changes due to factors such as lighting, perspective, or occlusion. This allows us to understand the world around us and interact with it effectively. The other options are not directly related to this phenomenon:\n\nA. color constancy - the ability to perceive objects as having consistent color despite changes in illumination.\nB. closure - the process of determining whether an object is complete or incomplete based on its shape and size.\nC. size constancy - the ability to perceive objects as having consistent size despite changes in their distance from the observer.\nD. size constancy - the ability to perceive objects as having consistent size despite changes in their distance from the observer.",
