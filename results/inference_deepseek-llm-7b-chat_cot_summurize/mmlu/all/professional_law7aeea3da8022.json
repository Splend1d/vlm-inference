The lawyer cannot win the case based on these grounds.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\nA. This option suggests that the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts, but the information printed by the columnist was true and not false.\nB. This option suggests that the publication was not newsworthy, but the information was relevant to the background research of the lawyer's nomination, making it newsworthy.\nD. This option suggests that the columnist was not involved in the burglary or the conspiring with the apprentice, but the question is about the lawyer's claim against the columnist, not the apprentice.",
