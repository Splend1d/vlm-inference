The killing took place on February 1. At the time that the crime occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous verdict of all 12 jury members for a conviction on a capital offense. On November 1, the state legislature enacted a new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense. The defendant's trial began on December 1. He was subsequently convicted of murder by an eight- to-four vote. Following the trial, the defendant's attorney filed a motion to set aside the verdict.

The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n\nassistant:The strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict in this case would be the ex post facto clause. This clause of the United States Constitution prohibits the passing of any law that increases punishment for a crime after it has been committed. In this case, the defendant was convicted of murder by an eight-to-four vote, which was a conviction that would have required a unanimous verdict under the previous law. The new law, enacted on November 1, allowed for a conviction with a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors. This change in the law could be seen as an increase in punishment, which would violate the ex post facto clause.",
