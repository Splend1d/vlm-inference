They were seated next to one another in the first- class section of the plane. Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband.

Hearsay is a statement that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Privileged communications are statements that are protected from disclosure by law. In this case, the wife's testimony would be hearsay because the man's confession to her would be offered into evidence to prove that he stole the money. Additionally, the husband-wife privilege would protect the conversation between the man and his wife, making it inadmissible as evidence. Therefore, the answer is D. inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
