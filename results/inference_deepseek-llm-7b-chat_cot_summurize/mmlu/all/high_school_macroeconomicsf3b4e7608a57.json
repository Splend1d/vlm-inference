This is because a larger money supply can lead to increased aggregate demand, which in turn can stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. On the other hand, a contraction in the money supply can have the opposite effect, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand and potentially causing a recession. Therefore, according to Keynesian theory, the Federal Reserve (the FED) should carefully manage the money supply to ensure that it is sufficient to support economic growth and stability.",
