Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Insufficient, because it is too vague.\n\nThis is because the description of the land to be conveyed is too vague and does not provide enough information to identify the specific property being conveyed. The statement \"one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita\" does not clearly describe the specific land being conveyed, and it is not clear what is meant by \"the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property\".",
