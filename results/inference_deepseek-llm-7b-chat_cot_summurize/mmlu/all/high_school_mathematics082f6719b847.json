How far does it travel?\n\nA. 16\nB. 2\\sqrt{2}\nC. 5\nD. 5+2\\sqrt{13}\n\nassistant:To find the distance traveled by the ant, we can use the distance formula. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n\n$$\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$$\n\nIn this case, the ant starts at $(-4,6)$ and ends at $(4,3)$. So, the distance is:\n\n$$\\sqrt{(4-(-4))^2 + (3-6)^2}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{16 + 9}$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{25}$$\n\n$$5$$\n\nSo, the ant travels a distance of 5 units. The correct answer is C.",
