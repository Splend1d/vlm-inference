In this case, the horrific summer thunderstorm led to a disproportionate number of long-finned fish dying, which caused a change in the relative frequency of the two forms (long-finned and short-finned) of fish in the pond. This change was due to a random event and not a result of natural selection or any other underlying genetic process.",
