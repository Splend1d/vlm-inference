Development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nassistant:The interactions described in the letters are best understood in the context of the development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the first source, King Afonso I of Kongo mentions the inconvenience of his people being kidnapped by Portuguese traders, who bring goods from Europe to Kongo. This trade was primarily driven by the demand for slaves. In the second source, King Manuel of Portugal instructs his envoy in Kongo to ensure that the expedition is profitable by filling the ships with goods such as slaves, copper, and ivory. This suggests that the Portuguese were involved in the trade of these goods, including slaves, which would have contributed to the development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
