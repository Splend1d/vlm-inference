In the context of the question, Frere was a British colonial administrator and archaeologist who made significant discoveries about the early human presence in Africa. His most famous discovery was in the region of Lake Turkana in Kenya, where he found evidence of early human habitation that challenged the prevailing belief that humans had not lived in the region. This discovery was significant because it revealed that humans had been present in Africa much earlier than previously thought, challenging the traditional view of human evolution.\n\nA. is incorrect because the remains Frere discovered were not beneath the remains of extinct animals, but rather much older human remains.\nB. is incorrect because the remains were found in a region that was previously thought to have no human history, not on the surface above the remains of extinct animals.\nD. is incorrect because Frere's discovery was not on top of the ruins of a Medieval castle, but rather in an area where no one thought humans had ever lived.",
