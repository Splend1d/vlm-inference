You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: If an X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the incidence in males equals 1 in 100, then the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be _______.\n\nA. 1 in 1000\nB. 1 in 4000\nC. 1 in 10 000\nD. 1 in 40 000\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg formula and the information given about the incidence of males with the X-linked recessive disorder.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg formula is: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\nwhere p is the frequency of dominant alleles, q is the frequency of recessive alleles, and pq is the frequency of heterozygotes.\n\nGiven that the incidence of males with the disorder is 1 in 100, we know that p = 0.01.\n\nSince the disorder is recessive, the frequency of homozygous females (who are affected by the disorder) is q^2. We want to find the expected incidence of homozygous females, which is q^2.\n\nWe can use the Hardy-Weinberg formula to find the value of q:\n\n0.01^2 + 2(0.01)(q) + q^2 = 1\n\nSolving for q:\n\nq^2 - 0.02 + 0.02q + 0.0001 = 1\nq^2 + 0.02q - 0.0199 = 0\n\nq = -0.02 + sqrt(0.02^2 + 4(-0.0199)) / 2\nq \u2248 -0.02 + 0.2058 / 2\nq \u2248 0.0967\n\nNow we can find the expected incidence of homozygous females:\n\nq^2 = 0.0967^2 \u2248 0.0011\n\nSo the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is approximately 1 in 10,000 (Option C).",
