Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it.

The number of possible assignments can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Total number of ways to assign the professors to the courses: C(20, 10)\n2. Number of ways to assign a professor to a course more than twice: C(20, 2) * 10\n3. Number of ways to assign a professor to a course more than 10 times: C(20, 10)\n\nNow, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\n\nTotal number of possible assignments = C(20, 10) - (C(20, 2) * 10) + C(20, 10)\n\nC(20, 10) = 10! / (10 - 2)! = 10! / 8! = 10^(20)\nC(20, 2) = 20! / (2 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2! * 18! * 17! * 16! * 15! * 14! * 13! * 12! * 11! * 10! * 9! * 8! * 7! * 6! * 5! * 4! * 3!) = 10! / (10! * 8! * 7! * 6! * 5! * 4! * 3! * 2! * 1) = 10! / (10! * 8! * 7! * 6! * 5! * 4! * 3! * 2!)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nTotal number of possible assignments = 10^(20) - (10! / (10! * 8! * 7! * 6! * 5! * 4! * 3! * 2!) * 10) + 10^(20)\n\nSince C(20, 10) - (C(20, 2) * 10) + C(20, 10) = C(20, 10) - C(20, 2) * 10 + C(20, 10) = 0, we have:\n\n10^(20) - 100 = 0\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 10^(20) - 100.",
