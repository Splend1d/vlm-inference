Piracy jure gentium is subject to flag State jurisdiction\nB. Piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction\nC. Piracy jure gentium is subject to port State jurisdiction\nD. Piracy jure gentium is subject to nationality-based jurisdiction\n\nassistant:Piracy jure gentium, or piracy under international law, is subject to universal jurisdiction. This means that any country can exercise jurisdiction over piracy committed on the high seas, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or the victims. While flag State jurisdiction and port State jurisdiction can also apply in certain circumstances, universal jurisdiction is the primary basis for prosecuting piracy jure gentium.\n\nUnder international law, piracy is defined as the crime of attacking and seizing ships at sea with the intention of committing theft or other crimes against the ship, its crew, or its passengers. Piracy jure gentium is a crime under international law, and as such, it is subject to universal jurisdiction.\n\nUniversal jurisdiction allows any country to prosecute individuals for crimes committed outside of its territory if the crime is considered to be of an international character, such as piracy, or if the crime was committed on the territory of another state and the state has waived its jurisdiction. In the case of piracy jure gentium, any country can prosecute perpetrators if they can establish jurisdiction over the crime.\n\nIt is important to note that while universal jurisdiction applies to piracy jure gentium, it does not necessarily mean that all countries will prosecute every case. Each country has its own legal system and procedures for handling cases of piracy, and some countries may not have the resources or willingness to prosecute every case that comes across their path.\n\nIn summary, piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction, which means that any country can exercise jurisdiction over piracy committed on the high seas. While flag State jurisdiction and port State jurisdiction can also apply in certain circumstances, universal jurisdiction is the primary basis for prosecuting piracy jure gentium.",
