False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.\nThis statement is true. A homomorphism is a function that maps one group to another, preserving the group operation. A homomorphism can have an empty kernel if the kernel of the original group is trivial.\n\nStatement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\nThis statement is false. It is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group. In fact, there is a theorem stating that every finite group has a nontrivial homomorphism into the infinite general linear group GL(n, R), which is an infinite group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are C. True, False, and D. False, True.",
