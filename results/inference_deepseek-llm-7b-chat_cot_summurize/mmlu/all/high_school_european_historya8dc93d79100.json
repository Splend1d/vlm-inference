It also suggests that the currently used method is not the most effective. This suggests that the method of empirical reasoning has not reached its full potential and could be improved upon. Therefore, the most likely change that occurred by the 1800s is that it had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
