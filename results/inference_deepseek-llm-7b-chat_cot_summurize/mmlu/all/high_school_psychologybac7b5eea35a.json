James-Lange theory of emotion\nB. Counterconditioning\nC. Catharsis hypothesis\nD. Transference\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Catharsis hypothesis.\n\nThe catharsis hypothesis suggests that expressing strong emotions, such as anger or fear, can help reduce their intensity and prevent aggressive behavior.

James-Lange theory of emotion suggests that emotions arise due to physiological changes in the body, not due to conscious awareness of the events that cause them.\n\nB. Counterconditioning is a type of behavior therapy that involves replacing an unwanted behavior with a more acceptable one.\n\nD. Transference is a psychological term used to describe the process by which unresolved emotions from one's past are projected onto another person, such as a therapist or a loved one.",
