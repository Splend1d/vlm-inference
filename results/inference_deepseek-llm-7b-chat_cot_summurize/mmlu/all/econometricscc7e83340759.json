Ensure that there is no heteroscedasticity in the test regression residuals.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test is a unit root test used to determine whether a time series is stationary or not. Augmenting the test involves adding additional variables to the regression model to control for potential sources of non-stationarity, such as autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. By doing so, the test can provide a more accurate assessment of the stationarity of the time series.",
