During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return.

If the corporation had been an S corporation, the cash dividends would have been distributed proportionally among the shareholders. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, he would have received 40% of the total cash dividends.\n\n2. The total cash dividends distributed during the tax year were $70,000. So, Carson would have received 40% of $70,000, which is 0.40 * $70,000 = $28,000.\n\n3. Carson already reported $28,000 in gross income on his individual tax return. Therefore, the answer is the same as the given answer: A. $28,000.",
