Determining whether 2SLS or ILS is optimal\nD. Determining whether the structural form equations can be obtained via substitution from the reduced forms\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. A Hausman test is used to determine whether an equation in a simultaneous system is identified. The Hausman test compares the estimated coefficients of the intercept and the regressors in the reduced-form and the structural-form equations. If the estimated coefficients in the reduced-form equation are statistically significantly larger than those in the structural-form equation, then the equation is said to be identified.",
