If the couple have a biological child, what is the chance that the child will inherit sickle-cell disease?\n\nA. 100%\nB. 75%\nC. 50%\nD. 25%\n\nassistant:Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The man and woman are both carriers of sickle-cell disease. This means that they have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but are not sickle-cell patients themselves.\n\n2. The chance of inheriting a genetic trait (like sickle-cell disease) is determined by the number of copies of the gene an individual has.\n\n3. In this case, the man and woman both have one copy of the sickle-cell gene. So, if they have a biological child, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n  - Scenario 1: The child inherits one copy of the sickle-cell gene from each parent.\n  - Scenario 2: The child inherits two copies of the sickle-cell gene from both parents (one from each parent).\n\n4. Scenario 1: In this case, the child has sickle-cell trait and is a carrier. So, the child has a 50% chance of passing on the sickle-cell gene to their offspring.\n\n5. Scenario 2: In this case, the child has sickle-cell disease. So, the child has a 100% chance of inheriting two copies of the sickle-cell gene from both parents.\n\nBased on the information provided, there are two possible scenarios. In Scenario 1, the chance that the child inherits sickle-cell disease is 50%. In Scenario 2, the chance that the child inherits sickle-cell disease is 100%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 25%.",
