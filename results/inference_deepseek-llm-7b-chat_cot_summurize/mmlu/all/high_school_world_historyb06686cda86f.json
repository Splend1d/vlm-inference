Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\nD. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\n\nassistant:The passage provided by the user is a quote from W.H. Moreland's book \"India at the Death of Akbar,\" which discusses the Mughal Empire's system of revenue collection. The quote describes the existence of separate states in Northern India during this period as being \"anomalous\" and dependent on the Mughal Empire. It also mentions that these states could pay revenue, refuse to pay it, or be in open rebellion at different times.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention any specific religions required for revenue collection.\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that revenue collection was the only source of funds for the Mughal Empire.\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not state that the case of Rajputana was typical in the Mughal Empire.\n\nOption B, however, seems to be the most appropriate answer. The passage suggests that geographical differences may have influenced which groups paid taxes in the Mughal Empire. This is supported by the fact that the passage mentions that there were numerous chiefs and tribes in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur occupying an \"anomalous\" position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence. This suggests that these regions had different political and geographical conditions that influenced the revenue collection process. Therefore, the passage provides evidence for the generalization that geographical differences may have influenced which groups paid taxes in the Mughal Empire.",
