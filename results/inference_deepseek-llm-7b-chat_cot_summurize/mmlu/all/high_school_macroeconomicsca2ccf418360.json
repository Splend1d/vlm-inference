Expectations of surpluses of goods in the future\nB. A decrease in income taxes\nC. An increase in government spending\nD. An increase in foreign income\n\nassistant:Option A, Expectations of surpluses of goods in the future, will cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. This is because if people expect to have more goods in the future, they are less likely to consume as much in the present. This reduced consumption will shift the aggregate demand curve to the left, leading to a decrease in the overall level of economic activity.",
