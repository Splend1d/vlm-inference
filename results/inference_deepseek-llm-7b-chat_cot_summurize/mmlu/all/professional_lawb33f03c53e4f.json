This is because the covenant against encumbrances in the deed required the landowner to convey the property free of any outstanding mortgages, and the mortgage was still outstanding at the time of the conveyance. Therefore, the farmer is entitled to recover for the amount he paid off the mortgage with interest. The other options are incorrect because they do not take into account the fact that the mortgage was still outstanding at the time of the conveyance, and the farmer did not take possession of the property with the encumbrance.",
