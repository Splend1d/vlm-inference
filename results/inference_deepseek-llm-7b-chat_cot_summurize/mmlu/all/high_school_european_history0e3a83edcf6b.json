They were interested in discussing and considering various philosophical inquiries and related topics, such as physics, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments. They were also interested in the latest discoveries and advancements in these fields, both at home and abroad.\n\nWhile it is true that the group barred discussions of divinity and state affairs, this was likely done to ensure that their meetings focused solely on the topics of natural philosophy and the New Philosophy. This focus on the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad suggests that their primary interest was to understand and evaluate the advancements and discoveries in this field, rather than to undermine traditional worldviews or create a secular science to challenge the Church.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. ascertaining the state of the New Philosophy in England and abroad.",
