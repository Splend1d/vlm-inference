Decreases Decreases\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to calculate the effects of allocating the labor rate variance and labor efficiency variance to different accounts (Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold) on the current ratio and net income.\n\n1. Labor rate variance:\n- If allocated to Work in Process: \n  - Labor cost per unit = (1 + labor rate variance) * labor cost per hour\n- If allocated to Finished Goods: \n  - Labor cost per unit = (1 + labor rate variance) * labor cost per hour\n- If allocated to Cost of Goods Sold: \n  - Labor cost per unit = labor cost per hour\n\n2. Labor efficiency variance:\n- If allocated to Work in Process: \n  - Labor hours per unit = (1 - labor efficiency variance) * labor hours per unit\n- If allocated to Finished Goods: \n  - Labor hours per unit = (1 - labor efficiency variance) * labor hours per unit\n- If allocated to Cost of Goods Sold: \n  - Labor hours per unit = labor hours per unit\n\nNow, let's calculate the effects on the current ratio and net income:\n\n1. Current ratio:\n  - Work in Process: (Beginning Work in Process * labor cost per unit) + (Cost of Goods Sold * labor cost per unit)\n  - Finished Goods: (Beginning Finished Goods * labor cost per unit) + (Cost of Goods Sold * labor cost per unit)\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: (Beginning Work in Process * labor cost per unit) + (Finished Goods * labor cost per unit)\n\n2. Net income:\n  - Work in Process: (Beginning Work in Process * labor hours per unit) + (Cost of Goods Sold * labor hours per unit)\n  - Finished Goods: (Beginning Finished Goods * labor hours per unit) + (Cost of Goods Sold * labor hours per unit)\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: (Beginning Work in Process * labor hours per unit) + (Finished Goods * labor hours per unit)\n\nTo determine the effects on the current ratio and net income, we need to compare the values obtained from the above calculations for Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nConsidering that the labor rate and labor efficiency variances were unfavorable, it is likely that the labor cost per unit in the Work in Process, Finished Goods, and Cost of Goods Sold accounts would be higher than the labor cost per unit in the original cost system. Consequently, allocating the variances to these accounts would result in higher labor costs and potentially lower net income and current ratio.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD.
