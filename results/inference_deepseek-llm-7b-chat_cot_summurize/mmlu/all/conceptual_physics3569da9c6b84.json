This can be done by increasing the electrical current flowing through the wire, which will cause more domains to align. Additionally, using a strong ferromagnetic material like iron will also increase the magnetic field strength.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fewer coils of wire will decrease the number of magnetic domains, which will reduce the magnetic field strength.\n\nOption B is incorrect because an increase in the diameter of the coil will not necessarily increase the magnetic field strength. The strength of an electromagnet is determined by the number of magnetic domains that are aligned, not by the diameter of the coil.\n\nOption D is incorrect because using an air core instead of iron will decrease the magnetic field strength, as there are fewer magnetic domains that can align in an air core.",
