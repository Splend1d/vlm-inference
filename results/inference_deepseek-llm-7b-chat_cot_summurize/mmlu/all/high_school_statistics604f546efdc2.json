P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nassistant:To compute the p-value, we will use the z-test for a single sample mean. The null hypothesis is H0: \u03bc = 4.0 ounces, and the alternative hypothesis is Ha: \u03bc > 4.0 ounces. The test statistic is z = (4.3 - 4.0) / 0.6 = 3.5.\n\nNow we need to find the p-value corresponding to this z-score. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find that the p-value for z = 3.5 is very small (less than 0.001), indicating that the data strongly reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. P(Z > 3.5)",
