If 20% of the contaminant can be removed during the first minute of the process and 98% must be removed to make the water safe, approximately how long will the decontamination process take?\n\nA. 2 min\nB. 5 min\nC. 18 min\nD. 20 min\n\nassistant:Let the amount of contaminant in the tank be represented by C, and let the amount of contaminant remaining after t minutes of purification be represented by Ct. Since the rate of removal is proportional to the amount of contaminant, we can write the following equation:\n\nC(t+1) = C(t) - k(t)Ct\n\nwhere k(t) is the rate of removal at time t.\n\nGiven that 20% of the contaminant can be removed during the first minute, we have:\n\n0.2C(1) = k(1)C(1)\n\nSolving for k(1), we get:\n\nk(1) = 5\n\nNow, we want to find Ct when 98% of the contaminant must be removed. We have:\n\n0.98C(t) = 0.98C(t+1)\n\nSubstituting k(t+1) = 5, we get:\n\n0.98C(t) = 5C(t+1)\n\nDividing both sides by C(t+1), we get:\n\n0.98/C(t+1) = 5/C(t)\n\nSince we know that 0.2C(1) = 5C(1), we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\n0.98/C(t+1) = 5/0.2C(1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n5/C(t+1) = 40/C(1)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of t+1. We know that 98% of the contaminant must be removed, which is equivalent to:\n\n0.98C(t) = 0.98C(t+1)\n\nSubstituting 0.2C(1) = 5C(1), we get:\n\n0.98C(t) = 0.98C(t+1)\n\nDividing both sides by C(t+1), we get:\n\n0.98/C(t+1) = 1\n\nSince we know that 5/C(t+1) = 40/C(1), we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\n0.98/C(t+1) = 1\n\n5/C(t+1) = 40/C(1)\n\nNow, we can solve for C(t+1):\n\nC(t+1) = (40/5) = 8\n\nNow, we can find the value of t+1 by subtracting 1 from the equation above:\n\nC(t+1) = 8\nCt = 1\n\nSince we know that 0.2C(1) = 5C(1), we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\nCt = 1\n0.2C(1) = 5C(1)\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 25\n\nNow, we can find the value of t+1 by subtracting 1 from the equation above:\n\nC(t+1) = 8\nCt = 1\n\nSince we know that 0.2C(1) = 5C(1), we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\nCt = 1\n0.2C(1) = 5C(1)\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 25\n\nNow, we can find the value of t+1 by subtracting 1 from the equation above:\n\nC(t+1) = 8\nCt = 1\n\nSince we know that 0.2C(1) = 5C(1), we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\nCt = 1\n0.2C(1) = 5C(1)\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 25\n\nNow, we can find the value of t+1 by subtracting 1 from the equation above:\n\nC(t+1) = 8\nCt = 1\n\nSince we know that 0.2C(1) = 5C(1), we can substitute this into the equation above:\n\nCt = 1\n0.2C(1) = 5C(1)\n\nSolving for C, we get:\n\nC = 25\n\nNow, we can find the value of t+1 by subtracting 1 from",
