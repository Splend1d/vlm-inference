However, she learned that cooling the system with dry ice (-78\u00b0C) caused the reaction to become spontaneous. Which of the following combinations must apply to this reaction?\n\nA. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G = 0\nB. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0\nC. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0\nD. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0\n\nassistant:The reaction is exothermic, meaning that \u0394H < 0. When the reaction is at 1 atm and 298 K, it is nonspontaneous because \u0394G > 0. When the system is cooled with dry ice, the temperature decreases to -78\u00b0C. This change in temperature causes the entropy change, \u0394S, to increase, as the system becomes more ordered. The increase in entropy will cause the reaction to become spontaneous, as \u0394G will decrease. Therefore, the reaction will be exothermic, nonspontaneous at 1 atm and 298 K, and spontaneous at -78\u00b0C.\n\nThe correct answer is C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0.",
