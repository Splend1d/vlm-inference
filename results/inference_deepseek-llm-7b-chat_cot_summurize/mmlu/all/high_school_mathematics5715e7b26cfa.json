In this case, we are looking at the function y = 5 + 3 * sin(pi \u2013 x).\n\nTo find the range of this function, we can analyze the different cases of the input x values.\n\n1. When x is within the range of 0 to 2*pi, sin(pi \u2013 x) is within the range of -1 to 1. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 5, we get values between -2 and 8.\n2. When x is within the range of 2*pi to 4*pi (or 2 to 4), sin(pi \u2013 x) is within the range of -1 to 1. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 5, we get values between -2 and 8.\n3. When x is within the range of 4*pi to 6*pi (or 4 to 6), sin(pi \u2013 x) is within the range of -1 to 1. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 5, we get values between -2 and 8.\n4. When x is within the range of 6*pi to 8*pi (or 6 to 8), sin(pi \u2013 x) is within the range of -1 to 1. Multiplying this by 3 and adding 5, we get values between -2 and 8.\n\nSince the input x can take on different values, the function y = 5 + 3 * sin(pi \u2013 x) can produce values within the range of -2 to 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \u20132 \u2264 y \u2264 8.",
