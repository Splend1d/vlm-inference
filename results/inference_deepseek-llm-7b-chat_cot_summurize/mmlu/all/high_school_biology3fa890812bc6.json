What is the simplest explanation for the inheritance of these colors in chickens?\n\nA. The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for black.\nB. The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for white.\nC. The traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance.\nD. The traits for black and white color demonstrate codominance.\n\nassistant:The simplest explanation for the inheritance of these colors in chickens is that the trait for gray is not epistatic over the trait for black or white. Instead, it is most likely that the traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance. This means that both parents contribute their alleles to the offspring, and the offspring will inherit one allele from each parent. However, the alleles for black and white color do not completely mask each other's effects. Instead, the offspring will have a certain intermediate phenotype that is a combination of both parents' alleles. This is why the offspring have 7 black and 8 white chicks.\n\nOn the other hand, if the trait for gray were epistatic over the trait for white, it would mean that the allele for gray would completely mask the allele for white, and the offspring would not have any white chicks. However, this is not the case, so the trait for gray is not epistatic over the trait for white.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. The traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance.",
