This means that the user receives a reward (in this case, a free ice cream) after a certain number of actions (purchasing ten items) have been taken, but the number of actions required before receiving the reward is not consistent. The user may need to purchase ten items multiple times before receiving the reward, or they may receive the reward after only a few purchases. This type of schedule is used when the reward is not given out frequently, but rather as a surprise or occasional reinforcement.",
