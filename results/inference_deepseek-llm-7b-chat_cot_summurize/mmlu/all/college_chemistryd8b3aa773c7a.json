(mCi = microcuries)\n\nA. 150 mCi\nB. 38 mCi\nC. 19 mCi\nD. 9.4 mCi\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the half-life formula for radioactive decay:\n\nA = A0 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\nA is the remaining activity after time t,\nA0 is the initial activity (150 mCi),\nt is the time elapsed (24 hours),\nT is the half-life of the isotope (6.0 hours).\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = 150 * (1/2)^(24/6)\nA = 150 * (1/2)^8\nA = 150 * (1/256)\nA = 6.01520833 mCi\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 19 mCi.",
