The Federal Reserve's primary responsibility is to regulate the money supply and maintain price stability in the economy. While it can influence these goals by buying and selling Treasury securities, setting the discount rate, and adjusting the reserve ratio, it does not have the authority to change tariffs and quotas on imported goods, which are regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and other government agencies.",
