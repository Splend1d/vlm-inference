This is why he opposes the idea of using pleasure and pain as the primary means of moral education.\n\nFeinberg believes that relying solely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions can lead to individuals doing the right thing out of fear of punishment, rather than out of a genuine understanding and commitment to the moral principles at play. Therefore, option A, which suggests that a good moral education will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions, aligns with Feinberg's views on the matter.\n\nIn contrast, options B, C, and D suggest that a good moral education will be based entirely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions, or will produce individuals who do the right thing out of deference to authority or simply because it is right, respectively. These options do not align with Feinberg's views, as they do not emphasize the importance of fostering genuine moral understanding and commitment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: According to Feinberg, a good moral education will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions.",
