An easement implied by prior use arises when a party has used a piece of land in a manner that would suggest that they have an easement over it. In this case, the wedding planner used the access road for years, and the neighbor's written grant of a right-of-way only reinforced the existence of this easement. This is different from an easement in gross, which is an easement that is not tied to the land, and from an easement by necessity, which is an easement that is necessary for the use of the dominant tenement (in this case, the wedding planner's property). Finally, an express easement is one that is explicitly stated in a written agreement, which is not the case here.",
