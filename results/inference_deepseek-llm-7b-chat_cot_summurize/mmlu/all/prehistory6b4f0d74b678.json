The general standard of living was high. \n\nTeotihuac\u00e1n was a significant Mesoamerican city that flourished from 100 CE to 750 CE. The city was known for its large, monumental architecture, such as the Avenue of the Dead and the Pyramid of the Sun and Moon. The early excavators of Teotihuac\u00e1n mistook ordinary housing compounds for palaces, which indicates that the city had a high standard of living. This can be inferred from the fact that the housing compounds were more elaborate and grand than the simple, ordinary houses that were initially thought to be palaces. \n\nOption B, commoners took over the residences of the elite, is not supported by the available evidence. While it is possible that some of the houses were inhabited by the elite, it is more likely that these houses were for the common people, who were also able to afford more elaborate housing.\n\nOption C, the city was a democracy, ruled by common farmers and artisans, is also not supported by the available evidence. There is no evidence to suggest that Teotihuac\u00e1n was a democracy. The city likely had a hierarchical social structure, with the elite holding power and authority over the common people.\n\nOption D, the society was mostly egalitarian, with almost no social stratification, is not supported by the available evidence either. While it is possible that there was some degree of egalitarianism in Teotihuac\u00e1n, it is more likely that the city had a hierarchical social structure with different social classes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A, the fact that early excavators of Teotihuac\u00e1n mistook ordinary housing compounds for palaces suggests the general standard of living was high.",
