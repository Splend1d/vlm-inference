Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation\nB. Custom is superior to English law and is always incorporated\nC. Custom must first be recognised by Parliament before the courts can bring it into the domestic sphere\nD. Custom is incorporated with the passing of implementing legislation\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Custom must first be recognised by Parliament before the courts can bring it into the domestic sphere.\n\nUnder English law, custom is a body of practices that has developed in a particular area or among a particular group of people over time. Custom is often considered to be the \"common law\" of that area or group, and it can sometimes be more widely recognized and accepted than statutory law.\n\nHowever, custom is not automatically incorporated into English law. Rather, it must first be recognized by Parliament before the courts can bring it into the domestic sphere. This recognition can occur through a variety of means, such as through the passing of implementing legislation or through the decision of the courts.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect because custom does not automatically become incorporated simply because it is not in conflict with existing legislation. Option B is incorrect because custom is not superior to English law and is not always incorporated. Option D is also incorrect because custom is not automatically incorporated with the passing of implementing legislation. Instead, it must first be recognized by Parliament.",
