Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home\n\nassistant:The most probable cause of the marital strain evident in the passage above is A. The strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation. The Jewish trader in India is expressing his longing to return home to his wife in Cairo, but acknowledges that the waiting has been long. He does not know if he will be granted relief to come home, or if it will take time. The passage suggests that the prolonged separation is a significant factor causing strain in their marriage.\n\nOption B, religious disagreements arising from the merchant's exposure to Hinduism, is not mentioned in the passage. Option C, a decision on the part of the merchant to remain permanently in India, is not mentioned either. Option D, bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home, is also not mentioned in the passage.",
