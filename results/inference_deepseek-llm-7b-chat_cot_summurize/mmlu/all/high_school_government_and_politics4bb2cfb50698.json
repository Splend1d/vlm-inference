The Articles of Confederation had given too much power to the states, and the Founders believed that a stronger central government was needed to protect the rights of citizens and to maintain national unity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the Founders did eventually create a bill of rights, it was not their primary objective in 1787. Option B is incorrect because the Founders did not create a national court system at this time. Option C is also incorrect because the Founders were primarily concerned with creating a stronger central government, not returning powers to the states.",
