The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6- bit sequences?\n\nA. 2 more items can be uniquely identified.\nB. 10 more items can be uniquely identified.\nC. 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.\nD. 10 times as many items can be uniquely identified.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the difference between 6-bit and 7-bit binary sequences and how they affect the number of unique items that can be identified.\n\n6-bit binary sequences can represent 64 unique items, as each bit can have two possible values (0 or 1), and there are 6 bits in total. Therefore, the number of unique items that can be identified is 2^6 = 64.\n\n7-bit binary sequences can represent 128 unique items, as each bit can have two possible values (0 or 1), and there are 7 bits in total. Therefore, the number of unique items that can be identified is 2^7 = 128.\n\nBy using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences, the online store can uniquely identify 128 - 64 = 64 more items. So, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2 more items can be uniquely identified.",
