Not enough information given.\n\nassistant:The answer is D. Not enough information given.\n\nThe problem with the question is that it doesn't provide information about the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell. It only provides information about the percentage of mice that pressed the lever for different power levels. To determine the absolute threshold, we would need to know the exact decibel level of the bell for each power level.",
