The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'\nB.

The so-called Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas\nD. The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris\n\nassistant:The 'Lotus principle' is a concept in international law that holds that if something is not explicitly prohibited by international law, it is allowed. This principle is named after a 1969 decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Dam. The court held that the Hungarian government could build a dam across the Danube River, as long as it did not violate international law. The court did not explicitly prohibit the dam, so it was allowed to proceed. The Lotus principle has been a subject of debate among international lawyers, as some argue that it goes too far in limiting the role of international law in regulating state behavior.",
