She can give an equal number of pieces of candy to 5, 3, or 2 people. Which number of pieces of candy could be in Lily\u2019s bag?\n\nA. 12\nB. 20\nC. 30\nD. 45\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of 5, 3, and 2 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of those integers. In this case, the LCM of 5, 3, and 2 is 60. Therefore, Lily could have 60 pieces of candy in her bag.\n\nThe answer is B. 20",
