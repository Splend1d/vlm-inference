The principal source of immunity for IOs is the UN Charter\nB. The principal sources of immunity for IOs are headquarters agreements and multilateral treaties providing specific immunities\nC. The principal source of immunity for IOs is customary law\nD. The principal source of immunity for IOs is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunities\n\nassistant:The principal source of immunity in respect of international organisations (IOs) is the UN Charter. The UN Charter, which is the foundational document of the United Nations, establishes the organization's structure, functions, and principles, including the immunities granted to IOs.\n\nOption B is incorrect because headquarters agreements and multilateral treaties providing specific immunities are secondary sources of immunity that supplement the general immunity granted to IOs by the UN Charter.\n\nOption C is incorrect because customary law is not the principal source of immunity for IOs. Customary law refers to practices and norms that have developed over time through the common agreement of nations and may apply to IOs in some cases, but it is not the primary source of their immunity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunities is a treaty that governs the diplomatic immunities of states and their missions. While it may provide additional immunities to IOs, it is not the primary source of their immunity. The UN Charter is the primary source of immunity for IOs, and the Vienna Convention supplements this general immunity.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is A: The principal source of immunity for IOs is the UN Charter.",
