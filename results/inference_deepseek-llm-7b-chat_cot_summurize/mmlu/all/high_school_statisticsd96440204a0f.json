I or II (but not both) and III.\n\nThe statement \"R-sq = 98.1%\" indicates that about 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable. This means that there is a strong linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables, but the direction of the relationship is not specified. Therefore, statement I and II are both possible.",
