Wilshire and Figueroa Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car.

The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. \" Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.\nB. The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.\nC. The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.\nD. The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.\n\nassistant:To determine the appropriate judgment in this case, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total damages suffered by each party:\n   - The businessman suffered $5,000 in damages.\n   - The woman suffered $1,000 in damages.\n\n2. Determine the percentage of each party's negligence:\n   - The woman was 30% negligent.\n   - The businessman was 70% negligent.\n\n3. Apply the statute's provisions to the damages suffered by each party:\n   - The woman's damages are diminished by the amount of her negligence (30%): $1,000 * (1 - 0.30) = $700.\n   - The businessman's damages are diminished by the amount of his negligence (70%): $5,000 * (1 - 0.70) = $3,500.\n\n4. Deduct the woman's damages from the businessman's damages:\n   - $3,500 (businessman's damages) - $700 (woman's diminished damages) = $2,800.\n\n5. Deduct the businessman's damages from the woman's damages:\n   - $5,000 (businessman's damages) - $1,000 (woman's damages) = $4,000.\n\n6. Calculate the amount the woman should recover from the businessman:\n   - $4,000 (businessman's damages) - $700 (woman's diminished damages) = $3,300.\n\n7. Divide the woman's recovery by the percentage of the woman's negligence:\n   - $3,300 / (1 - 0.30) = $1,000.\n\n8. The businessman should recover $1,000 from the woman.\n\nSo, the appropriate judgment in this case is D. The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.",
