The question states that uppercase letters precede lowercase letters when considering alphabetical order.\n\nComparing the strings strA, strB, and strC, we can see that strA contains only uppercase letters, strB contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, and strC contains only lowercase letters.\n\nUsing the compareTo method, we can compare these strings:\n\nstrA.compareTo(strB) will compare the first character of strA (C) to the first character of strB (c). Since C is uppercase and c is lowercase, strA will be greater than strB.\n\nstrB.compareTo(strC) will compare the first character of strB (c) to the first character of strC (c). Since both characters are lowercase, strB will be less than strC.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. strA.compareTo(strB) < 0 && strB.compareTo(strC) > 0",
