Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because we cannot conclude that wasteful driving is morally permissible based on the information provided. Option B is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about particularism. Option D is incorrect because the passage does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that wasteful driving is not wrong.",
