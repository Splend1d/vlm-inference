Their negotiations continued for some time. J ack is asserting that Jill made an offer and promise which he accepted with a return promise. Jill asserts that the agreement was not what she intended. In determining whether a contract has been created, the courts look primarily at\n\nA. The fairness to the parties.\nB. The objective intent of the parties.\nC. The subjective intent of the parties.\nD. The subjective intent of the offeror.\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the context provided:\n\nA. The fairness to the parties: This option is not directly relevant to whether a contract has been created or not. The fairness of the agreement may be a consideration in evaluating the legality of the contract, but it is not the primary factor.\n\nB. The objective intent of the parties: This option is more relevant to the question. When courts analyze a contract, they consider the objective intent of the parties to determine if a legally binding agreement has been formed. This means that they look at the intent that the parties had when they agreed on the terms of the deal, not their subjective intentions.\n\nC. The subjective intent of the parties: This option is not the primary factor that the courts consider when determining whether a contract has been created. The objective intent of the parties is more important, as it helps to establish the legal validity of the agreement.\n\nD. The subjective intent of the offeror: This option is not relevant to the question. The courts do not focus on the subjective intent of the offeror when analyzing whether a contract has been formed.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B. The objective intent of the parties.",
