The roots of the polynomial can be found by trying all possible values in Z_3:\n\n1. For c = 0, the polynomial is x^3 + 0x^2 + 1. The roots are x = 0, 1, and 2.\n2. For c = 1, the polynomial is x^3 + x^2 + 1. The roots are x = 0, 1, and 2.\n3. For c = 2, the polynomial is x^3 + 2x^2 + 1. The roots are x = 0, 1, and 2.\n\nSince the polynomial has roots in Z_3 for all possible values of c, the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a field. Therefore, all elements of Z_3 are solutions to the given polynomial.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nD. 3 (All elements of Z_3)",
