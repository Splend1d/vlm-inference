These changes were made possible by the end of the Cold War, as the East-West confrontation that had previously stymied United Nations action against aggression was no longer a significant factor. The other options do not directly contribute to the emergence of a new world order. American economic prosperity (A) and the Iranian Hostage Crisis (C) were both factors, but they were not the main drivers of change. President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (B) was a policy proposal, but it did not directly contribute to the emergence of a new world order.",
