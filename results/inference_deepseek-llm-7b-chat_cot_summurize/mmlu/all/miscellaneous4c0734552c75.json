Categorize the components of a technical system. This objective allows students to develop their problem-solving and critical thinking skills by analyzing and understanding the different components of a technical system, which is essential for developing creative technical solutions.\n\nA. Design and construct a three-dimensional model of a low-income, multifamily dwelling unit is a good objective for developing technical skills such as design, construction, and engineering, but it may not directly contribute to developing creative technical solutions for societal problems.\n\nB. Describe several construction careers that are related to home building is a good objective for introducing students to different career paths in the construction industry, but it does not directly contribute to developing creative technical solutions.\n\nD. Identify the major tools and equipment used in highway construction is a good objective for introducing students to the tools and equipment used in construction, but it does not directly contribute to developing creative technical solutions for societal problems.",
