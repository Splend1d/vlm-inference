In this situation, administering an outdated form of an achievement test that aligns with the curriculum of the school district at that time might not provide an accurate or fair assessment of the child's abilities. Therefore, the school psychologist should ask that at least a few copies of the new form be administered for comparison. This way, they can compare the results with the old form and determine if any significant differences exist, and if so, make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, it is essential to consider the potential impact on the child's self-esteem and well-being when using an outdated test form that does not accurately represent their abilities.",
