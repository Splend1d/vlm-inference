False, False\n\nassistant:Statement 1: f : X \u2192 Y is continuous and X is compact. f must be uniformly continuous.\n\nA function f : X \u2192 Y is said to be uniformly continuous if for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that for all x, y in X, if |x - y| < \u03b4, then |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5. This implies that as x and y get closer together, the difference between their images under f becomes arbitrarily small.\n\n compactness of X ensures that for any sequence {x_n} in X, there exists a convergent subsequence {x_{n_k}} with limit x in X. This means that any sequence in X has a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in X.\n\n Since f is continuous, the preimage of any closed set in Y is also closed. By the Portmanteau theorem, for any closed set A in Y, there exists a compact subset K of X such that f^(-1)(A) = {x \u2208 X | f(x) \u2208 A} is a subset of K.\n\n By the Heine-Borel theorem, K is also compact if it is closed and bounded. Since the preimage of any closed set A in Y is also closed, we have that f^(-1)(A) is bounded.\n\n Now, for any sequence {x_n} in K, we have that f^(-1)(f(x_n)) = {x \u2208 K | f(x) \u2208 f^(-1)(f(x_n))}. This means that for any sequence in the preimage of a closed set A in Y, there exists a convergent subsequence that converges to a point in X.\n\n By the definition of uniformly continuous, we have that f is uniformly continuous.\n\nStatement 2: If f(x), g(x) : R \u2192 R are everywhere differentiable, then f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable.\n\nDifferentiability is a property of real-valued functions, and it is defined as the existence of a derivative. The derivative of a function f at a point x is the limit of the difference quotients of f at points near x as h gets closer to 0.\n\n Differentiability is not affected by composition. In other words, if f and g are differentiable, then f(g(x)) is also differentiable. This is because the derivative of f(g(x)) is the derivative of f composed with the derivative of g, i.e., (df)(g(x)).\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. True, True.",
