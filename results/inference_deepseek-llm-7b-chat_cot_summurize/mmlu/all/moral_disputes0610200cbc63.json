This means that we should recognize that these forms of speech are harmful and discriminatory towards specific groups of women, and take action to stop them.\n\nOption A is incorrect because denying that subsets of women can be the targets of hate speech is denying the reality of the harm that these women face.\n\nOption B is incorrect because saying that this speech is merely sexist speech is not an appropriate response to hate speech, as hate speech is a form of discrimination that is based on the victim's group membership, and it is more harmful than mere sexism.\n\nOption D is incorrect because understanding misogynistic speech as akin to other forms of oppressive speech against racial minorities does not necessarily address the specific harm that subsets of women face.",
