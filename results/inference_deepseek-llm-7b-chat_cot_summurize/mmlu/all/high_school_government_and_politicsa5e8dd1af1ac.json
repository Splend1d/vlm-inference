II and III only\n\nassistant:A president is more likely to experience a reduction in political power if the number and severity of international crises is increasing (II) and different parties control Congress and the White House (III). This is because international crises can lead to a decrease in public support and international alliances, while control of Congress and the White House by different parties can lead to gridlock and a lack of cooperation on policy. Even though the economy is strong and the president's approval ratings are high (IV), this does not necessarily mean that the president's power will not decrease due to the other factors mentioned.",
