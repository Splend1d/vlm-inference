Such intent can be shown by all but which of the following?\n\nA. A law that is discriminatory on its face.\nB. A discriminatory application of a facially neutral law.\nC. A discriminatory effect.\nD. A discriminatory motive.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nA. A law that is discriminatory on its face.\nThis option is not correct because it is a valid way to show intent to discriminate. If the law itself is discriminatory, it implies that the government had intent to discriminate when creating the law.\n\nB. A discriminatory application of a facially neutral law.\nThis option is not correct because it is also a valid way to show intent to discriminate. If the government discriminates in the application of a neutral law, it implies that they had intent to discriminate.\n\nC. A discriminatory effect.\nThis option is not correct because it is not a valid way to show intent to discriminate. A discriminatory effect can occur even if the government did not have intent to discriminate. For example, a law with a discriminatory effect might be created without intent to discriminate.\n\nD. A discriminatory motive.\nThis option is the correct answer. A discriminatory motive is the only way to show intent to discriminate. If the government had a discriminatory motive but did not act on it, it would still be considered intent to discriminate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. A discriminatory motive.",
