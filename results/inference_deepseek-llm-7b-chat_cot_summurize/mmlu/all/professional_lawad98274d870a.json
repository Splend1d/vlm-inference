After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.\n\nThe woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. This shows that she was relying on the owner's offer and was taking a risk by making these changes. The owner knew about this and still allowed her to make these changes. This means that an option contract was formed between them.\n\nThe owner's revocation of the option to purchase the condo would be ineffective because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer. However, this does not necessarily mean that an enforceable contract was formed.\n\nThe written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months, as stated in option B. However, this does not necessarily mean that an enforceable contract was formed.\n\nThe written notice of acceptance of the option by the woman was not accepted by the owner, and therefore, it is not clear whether an enforceable contract was formed.\n\nTherefore, the strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between the woman and the owner is D: After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.",
