No, because a judge may not testify in a matter over which he or she is presiding.\n\nThe judge is prohibited from testifying as a witness in this case because he is presiding over the trial. This is a common-law rule that prevents a judge from being a witness in a matter over which they are presiding. The judge's testimony would be seen as biased and would not be impartial. Therefore, the judge cannot be called as a witness.",
