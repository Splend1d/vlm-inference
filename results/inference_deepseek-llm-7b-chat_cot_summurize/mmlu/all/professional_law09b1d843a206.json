An undivided one-half interest with right of survivorship.\nC. An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\nD. A lien against the entire property.\n\nassistant:The aunt would have an undivided one-half interest with right of survivorship if the wife transfers her interest in the dairy by quitclaim deed without the husband's knowledge. This is because tenants by the entirety is a type of joint tenancy with right of survivorship, meaning that if one spouse dies, the surviving spouse inherits the entire property. The aunt would have an undivided one-half interest in the property if she is added as a joint tenant with the wife, but she would not have an interest in the entire property if the husband were not present or was not added as a joint tenant.",
