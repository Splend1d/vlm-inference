Radiation from anti-oxidants\nB. Metabolic processes\nC. Free radicals and sunlight\nD. Telomerase\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Free radicals and sunlight.\n\nDNA damage/repair theory suggests that senescence is caused by cells receiving incorrect instructions from DNA that has been damaged by sources such as free radicals and sunlight. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can cause damage to DNA by breaking chemical bonds, while sunlight contains ultraviolet rays that can also cause DNA damage. These damages can lead to the accumulation of mutations and eventually cause cells to stop dividing, leading to senescence.",
