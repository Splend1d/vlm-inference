At that rate how many parts can she produce in 35 hours?\n\nA. 220 parts\nB. 770 parts\nC. 4 parts\nD. 110 parts\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion. Since the worker takes 7 hours to produce 22 parts, we can set up the proportion:\n\n7 hours / 22 parts = x hours / y parts\n\nNow we can solve for y:\n\ny = 7 * y / 22\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\ny = 7 / 1.11 (since y must be a whole number)\n\ny = 6\n\nSo, the worker can produce 6 parts in 1 hour. Now, we can find out how many parts she can produce in 35 hours:\n\n6 parts/hour * 35 hours = 210 parts\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 110 parts.",
