Open-structured ice crystals are the cause of regelation. Regelation is the refreezing of water on surfaces such as snow or ice. When water is cooled to the point of freezing, it expands and forms ice crystals. These ice crystals can have different structures, but open-structured ice crystals are the most common. These ice crystals have flat, open surfaces that allow them to stick to each other, creating a new layer of ice on the surface. This process of refreezing is called regelation. The other options do not directly cause regelation. High specific heat refers to the ability of a substance to absorb energy without increasing its temperature. High rate of expansion refers to the ability of a substance to increase in volume when heated. Slight tendency to freeze when its temperature is lowered refers to the tendency of water to freeze when the temperature is lowered, but it does not explain the process of regelation.",
