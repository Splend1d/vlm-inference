He must put the symbols +, $\\times$, and - (plus, times, and minus) in the following blanks, using each symbol exactly once:\\[2 \\underline{\\hphantom{8}} 4 \\underline{\\hphantom{8}} 6 \\underline{\\hphantom{8}} 8.\\] John cannot use parentheses or rearrange the numbers. What is the highest possible number that John could obtain?\n\nA. 22\nB. 46\nC. 100\nD. 99\n\nassistant:We can see that the number must be divisible by 2, 4, and 6. The largest number that is divisible by all three numbers is 36. We can then place the symbols in the following way:\n\\[36 = 2 \\times (4 - 2) \\times (6 + 2) \\times (8 - 2).\\]\nThus, the highest possible number that John could obtain is 36, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
