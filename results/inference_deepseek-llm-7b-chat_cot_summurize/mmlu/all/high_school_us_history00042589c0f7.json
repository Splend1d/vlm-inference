The advantage of superior numbers\nB. The superior military skill of mercenaries\nC. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\nD. Effective use of European artillery\n\nassistant:The passage mentions that Cortes \"brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard\" and that these mercenaries included \"adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them.\"\n\nDespite these diverse backgrounds and interests, Cortes was able to bring them together and motivate them to work in harmony towards a common goal. This suggests that Cortes had a unique ability to unite and inspire his troops, which was a key factor in his military success.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The advantage of superior numbers is not mentioned in the passage, and while Cortes did use artillery, this is not specifically mentioned either. While the mercenaries might have had some military skill, the passage does not focus on this aspect. Cortes's ability to unite and inspire his diverse group of troops was the most important factor in his military success.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
