If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.

The ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith\nD. The ideals of globalization as evidenced by multinational trade blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union\n\nassistant:Mao Zedong's view of the cooperation of peasant labor is most directly influenced by the ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin. This can be seen in his emphasis on the socialist transformation of agriculture and the elimination of rich-peasant and individual economies in the countryside. Mao also stresses the need for a new basis for the worker-peasant alliance, which aligns with the principles of communism.\n\nOption B, the ideals of the Enlightenment as stated by political revolutionaries such as Maximilian Robespierre, does not seem relevant to Mao's views. The Enlightenment was a European movement that emphasized individual rights and freedoms, while Mao's ideas focused more on collective action and the elimination of social classes.\n\nOption C, the ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith, is also not relevant. Classical liberalism emphasizes individual freedom and private property, which are not present in Mao's views. Instead, Mao advocates for collective ownership of land and the elimination of individual economies.\n\nOption D, the ideals of globalization as evidenced by multinational trade blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union, is not a direct influence on Mao's views. Mao's ideas are more focused on the socialist transformation of society and the worker-peasant alliance, rather than global trade and economic integration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The ideals of the Enlightenment as stated by political revolutionaries such as Maximilian Robespierre.",
