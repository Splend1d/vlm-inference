Elimination of mandatory school attendance laws\nD. Annual limits on the number of foreigners immigrating into the United States\n\nassistant:B. More investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services produces a faster rate of economic growth for the United States.\n\nTo elaborate, higher tariffs on imported goods would make domestic goods more expensive, which could lead to inflation and lower economic growth. Eliminating mandatory school attendance laws would not have a significant impact on economic growth as it does not directly affect the economy. Annual limits on the number of foreigners immigrating into the United States would not necessarily increase economic growth, as the impact on the labor market would depend on the specific policies and the country's immigration system.\n\nOn the other hand, investing in capital infrastructure and promoting less consumption of nondurable goods and services would stimulate economic growth. Capital investment, such as building new roads, bridges, and other public infrastructure, would create jobs and encourage economic growth. Furthermore, promoting less consumption of nondurable goods and services would encourage people to save money and invest in businesses, which would contribute to economic growth.",
