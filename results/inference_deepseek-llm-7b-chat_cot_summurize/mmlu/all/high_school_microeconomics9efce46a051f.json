I and II only\n\nIn a perfect competition market structure, firms do not maximize profits by producing where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. Instead, they aim to capture a share of the market demand by setting their prices at a level that equates the demand curve with the marginal cost curve. In a monopolistic competition market structure, firms do not maximize profits by producing where marginal cost equals marginal revenue either. Instead, they set their prices to maximize profits, taking into account the prices set by other firms in the market.\n\nIn an oligopoly market structure, firms do maximize profits by producing where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. This is because firms in an oligopoly have market power and can influence the market price through their production decisions. In a monopoly market structure, firms also maximize profits by producing where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. This is because they have complete control over the market and can set their prices to maximize profits.",
