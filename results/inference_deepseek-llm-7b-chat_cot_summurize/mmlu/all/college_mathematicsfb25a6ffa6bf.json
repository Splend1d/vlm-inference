If dim(V \u2229 W) = 0, then v1 and w1 are linearly independent but v2 and w2 are not. This means that V and W are parallel, which is not possible since they are 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4.\n\n2. If dim(V \u2229 W) = 1, then v1, w1, v2, and w2 are linearly independent. This means that V and W are distinct 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4, and their intersection is a 1-dimensional subspace.\n\n3. If dim(V \u2229 W) = 2, then v1, w1, v2, and w2 are linearly dependent on each other, which means that V and W are not distinct 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4.\n\nThus, the only possible dimensions of the intersection of V and W are 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer is D. 0, 1, and 2 only.",
