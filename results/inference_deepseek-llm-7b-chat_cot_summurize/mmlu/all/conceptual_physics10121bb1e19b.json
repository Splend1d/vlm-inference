A spinning system contracts.\n2. In the absence of an external torque.\n3. The system's rotational speed increases.\n4. The system's angular momentum changes.\n\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\n\nA. Decreases: This option contradicts the information provided, as the rotational speed increases.\n\nB. Increases: This option matches the information given, as the rotational speed increases and angular momentum changes.\n\nC. Remains unchanged: This option is not consistent with the information, as the rotational speed increases and angular momentum changes.\n\nD. May increase or decrease: This option is too general and doesn't provide a clear answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Increases.",
