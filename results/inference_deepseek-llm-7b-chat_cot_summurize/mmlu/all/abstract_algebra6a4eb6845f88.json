Statement 2 | If F is a field then every ideal of F[x] is principal.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)+g(x)) = maximum (deg f(x), deg g(x)). This statement is true. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. When adding two polynomials with the same highest degree, the degree of the sum is equal to the highest degree of the polynomials.\n\nStatement 2: If F is a field then every ideal of F[x] is principal. This statement is false. In a field, every non-zero polynomial has a root, but this does not guarantee that the ideal generated by the polynomial is principal. For example, consider the field F = {0, 1} and the polynomial f(x) = x^3 + 1. The ideal generated by f(x) is {0} and is not principal.",
