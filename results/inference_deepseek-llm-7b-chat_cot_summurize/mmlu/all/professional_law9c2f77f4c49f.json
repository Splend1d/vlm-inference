If the uncle moves to another state, the property goes to the brother for the remaining years of the uncle's life. Finally, if the uncle does not move to another state, the property goes to the uncle's heirs. If the uncle does move to another state, the property goes to the brother's heirs.\n\nThis type of deed is called an \"estate pur autre vie,\" which means \"an estate for another life.\" The brother's interest in this situation is an estate pur autre vie because he will only receive the property if the uncle does not move to another state. The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the brother's interest in the property.",
