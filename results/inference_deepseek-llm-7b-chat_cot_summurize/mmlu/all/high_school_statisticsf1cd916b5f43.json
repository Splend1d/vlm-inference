A randomized block design, blocked on type of pan, with 12 treatment groups\n\nassistant:A completely randomized design with nine treatment groups is the best description of the necessary experiment. This is because the manufacturer is testing the effects of four different temperature levels, two different types of pans, and three different types of ovens, resulting in a total of nine treatment groups. Each combination of these factors will be tested, and the results will be analyzed to determine the effects on the texture of the cakes.",
