This privilege is a fundamental right that protects individuals from being forced to incriminate themselves. In this case, the instruction effectively compelled the defendant to admit to the crime of intoxication by requiring the jury to find him guilty based on the presumption alone, without the need for the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This violates the defendant's right to a fair trial and, therefore, the conviction should be reversed.",
