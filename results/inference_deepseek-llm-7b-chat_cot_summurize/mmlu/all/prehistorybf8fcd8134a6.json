The size of their brains, with a mean brain size slightly larger than modern humans, may indicate that Homo erectus was capable of complex thought processes and creativity, which could have included the creation of art.\n\nCave paintings and elaborate burials with numerous grave goods at the Trinil site also provide evidence of Homo erectus's potential for aesthetic appreciation and the ability to create art. The engraved shell found at the Trinil site is another indication of Homo erectus's potential for aesthetic expression, as the intentional creation of lines on the shell suggests an appreciation for and desire to create beauty.\n\nWhile it is difficult to definitively determine whether Homo erectus created \"art\" in the modern sense of the word, the combination of these factors suggests that they may have had an aesthetic sense and a desire to express themselves through visual means.",
