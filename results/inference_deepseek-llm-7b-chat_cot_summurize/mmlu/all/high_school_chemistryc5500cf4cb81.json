Step 1. Solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute. Step 2. Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent. Step 3. Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces. Which of the following statements about the energy involved in the above is correct?\n\nA.

All three steps are endothermic.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Steps 1 and 2 are exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic. Exothermic processes release energy, while endothermic processes absorb energy. In the process of solution formation, the solvent molecules are separated from each other (exothermic), the solute molecules are separated (exothermic), and the separated solute and solvent are brought together (endothermic).",
