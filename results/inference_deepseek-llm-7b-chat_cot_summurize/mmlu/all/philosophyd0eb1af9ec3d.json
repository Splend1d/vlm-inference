This is because knowing the essence of justice or virtue would allow the person to apply these principles in various situations, not just the ones that the examples directly apply to.\n\nA is incorrect because knowing enough examples of justice or virtue is not enough to live a worthwhile life, and knowing the essence of justice or virtue is necessary for living a fulfilling life.\n\nC is incorrect because Socrates believed that the essence of justice or virtue could be known through reflection and self-examination, rather than through asking people for their opinions and respecting each answer as equally valuable.\n\nD is incorrect because although justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, Socrates believed that knowing the essence of justice or virtue is necessary to achieve these goals in various situations.",
