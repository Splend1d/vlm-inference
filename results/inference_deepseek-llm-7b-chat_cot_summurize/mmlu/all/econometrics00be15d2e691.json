(i) and (iii) only.\n\nExplanation:\n\ni) If two variables are cointegrated, they do not need to be stationary. However, if they are not stationary, they may not be cointegrated.\n\nii) The statement that only one linear combination of $x_t$ and $y_t$ will be stationary is true. This is known as the Engle-Granger (EG) representation of cointegration.\n\niii) The cointegrating equation for $x_t$ and $y_t$ describes the long-run relationship between the two series.\n\niv) The residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ must be stationary if $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated.\n\nTherefore, only statements (ii) and (iv) are true for cointegration.",
