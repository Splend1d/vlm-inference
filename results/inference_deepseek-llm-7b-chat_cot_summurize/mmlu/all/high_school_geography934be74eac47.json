Latin America\n\nSpanish colonial architecture, uneven economic development, and rural-to-urban migration flows are commonly found in Latin America, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina. These factors are also present to varying degrees in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, but are more pronounced in Latin America. North America, on the other hand, has a different historical background and development trajectory, with its own unique characteristics and patterns of urbanization and migration.",
