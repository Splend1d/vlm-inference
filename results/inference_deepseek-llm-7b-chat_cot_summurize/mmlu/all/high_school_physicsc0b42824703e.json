Between t = 0 and t = 1 second, the body has a constant speed of 24 meters per second. At t = 1 second, the body is given a constant acceleration of 6 meters per second squared in the negative x direction. The position x of the body at t = 11 seconds is\n\nA. 99m\nB. 36m\nC. -36m\nD. -99m\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the equation of motion for constant acceleration:\n\nx(t) = x(0) + v(0)t + (1/2)a(t)t^2\n\nwhere x(t) is the position of the body at time t, x(0) is the initial position, v(0) is the initial velocity, a(t) is the acceleration at time t, and t is the time.\n\nAt t = 0, the body is at the origin (x(0) = 0). The initial velocity is 24 meters per second, so v(0) = 24. At t = 1 second, the body starts accelerating at 6 meters per second squared, so a(1) = 6.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nx(1) = 0 + 24(1) + (1/2)(6)(1)\nx(1) = 24 + 3\nx(1) = 27\n\nAt t = 11 seconds, the body's position is:\n\nx(11) = 27 + 24(11) + (1/2)(6)(11)\nx(11) = 27 + 276 + 33\nx(11) = 336\n\nSo the position of the body at t = 11 seconds is 336 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. -36m",
