Right after lunch, the fattened big fish has a change in\n\nA. speed\nB. momentum\nC. Both\nD. Neither\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. speed.\n\nIn the given visual content, the big fish swims upon and swallows the small fish. This implies that the big fish is in motion and the small fish is not. After the big fish swallows the small fish, it becomes fatter. However, this does not change its speed or momentum. The big fish's speed remains the same as it was before swallowing the small fish. Therefore, the correct answer is A. speed.\n\nAs an AI, I am not able to provide visual content. However, I can explain that the word \"change\" in the question implies that there should be a difference in the big fish's speed after it swallows the small fish. Since the big fish's speed remains the same, the correct answer is A. speed.",
