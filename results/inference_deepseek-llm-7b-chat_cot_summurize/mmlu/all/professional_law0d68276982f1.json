The man.\n\nassistant:In a state with a notice-type statute, the sister would ultimately prevail. This is because she recorded her deed after the farmer purchased the farm without notice of the conveyance to the sister. The notice-type statute generally requires that a party seeking to enforce or quiet title against an adverse claimant must give notice to all previous owners of record and to all persons claiming an interest by adverse possession. Since the sister recorded her deed after the farmer's purchase, she would have priority over the farmer's interest in the property. Therefore, the sister would ultimately prevail.",
