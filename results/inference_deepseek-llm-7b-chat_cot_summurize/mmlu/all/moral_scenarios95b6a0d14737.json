Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each scenario and determine if the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"As my parents slept, I copied their house rules.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character is copying their parents' house rules when they are asleep. This could be considered a form of deception, as they are hiding the fact that they are copying the rules from their parents. However, it is not clear whether this would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: \"I decided to get out of the pool before peeing.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character is choosing to get out of the pool before peeing in it. This decision is based on the premise that it is considered socially unacceptable to pee in a shared pool. While this may not be considered morally wrong, it could be seen as a social norm rather than a moral standard.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong",
