You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The coefficient of the (x \u2013 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial for y = x2/3 around x = 8 is\n\nA. -1/144\nB. -1/72\nC. 1/144\nD. 1/6\n\nassistant:The Taylor polynomial for y = x^2/3 around x = 8 is given by:\n\ny(x) = (8/3)^2/3 + (x - 8)^2 * (8/3)^2/3\n\nThe (x - 8)2 term is (x - 8)^2, so the (x - 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial is:\n\n(x - 8)^2 = (x - 8)(x - 8)\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n(x - 8)(x - 8) = x^2 - 16x + 64\n\nSo the (x - 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial is:\n\n(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64\n\nNow we need to find the coefficient of the (x - 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial. We do this by taking the derivative of the Taylor polynomial with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = 2x * (8/3)^2/3 + 2(x - 8)(x - 8)\n\nWe can find the coefficient of the (x - 8)2 term by taking the derivative of the (x - 8)2 term:\n\n2(x - 8) = 2x - 16\n\nSo the coefficient of the (x - 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial is:\n\n-16\n\nThe coefficient of the (x - 8)2 term in the Taylor polynomial for y = x^2/3 around x = 8 is -16. However, the options provided are all negative, so the closest answer is:\n\nB. -1/72",
