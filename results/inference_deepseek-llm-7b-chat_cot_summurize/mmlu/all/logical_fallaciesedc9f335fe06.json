In a conditional or hypothetical argument, the minor premise is used to make a claim about the truth of the consequent based on the truth of the antecedent. The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent (if the consequent is true, the antecedent must also be true) or deny the consequent (if the consequent is false, the antecedent can be true or false).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
