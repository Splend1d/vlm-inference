He argued that the ultimate virtue is pleasure, but he did not mean hedonistic pleasure. Rather, he meant the pleasurable emotions that arise from living a simple, moderate, and peaceful life.\n\nAccording to Epicurus, all other virtues spring from pleasure. A person who is truly happy and content will naturally exhibit these virtues: prudence, temperance, justice, and courage.\n\nA. prudence: Epicurus believed that a person who is truly happy will make wise decisions and use their knowledge and experience to navigate life's challenges.\n\nB. temperance: Epicurus believed that a person who is truly happy will live a simple, moderate, and peaceful life, avoiding excesses and unnecessary desires.\n\nC. justice: Epicurus believed that a person who is truly happy will treat others with kindness and fairness, and will not harm others for their own gain.\n\nD. courage: Epicurus believed that a person who is truly happy will face life's challenges with courage and determination, and will not be easily intimidated or swayed by fear.\n\nTherefore, all other virtues, including prudence, temperance, justice, and courage, ultimately spring from pleasure, the ultimate virtue according to Epicurus.",
