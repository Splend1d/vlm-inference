Forty jars filled by this machine are selected at random. What is the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces?\n\nA. 0.0057\nB. 0.0225\nC. 0.025\nD. 0.05\n\nassistant:This problem can be solved using the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we have a population distribution with a mean (\u03bc) of 4 ounces and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 0.25 ounces. We are sampling 40 jars, so the sample size (n) is 40.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (\u03bc_sample) is equal to the population mean (\u03bc), which is 4 ounces.\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (\u03c3_sample) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03c3_sample = \u03c3 / \u221an\n\n\u03c3_sample = 0.25 / \u221a40 \u2248 0.0736\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 3.9 ounces:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc_sample) / \u03c3_sample\n\nz = (3.9 - 4) / 0.0736 \u2248 -6.31\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability that the z-score is less than -6.31:\n\nP(-\u221e < z < -6.31) = 0.0057\n\nTherefore, the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces is approximately 0.0057, which corresponds to answer choice A.",
