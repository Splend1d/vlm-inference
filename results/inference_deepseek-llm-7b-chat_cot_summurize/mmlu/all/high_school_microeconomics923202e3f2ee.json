(MC-P)/MC\nB. (MC-P)/P\nC. (P-MC)/P\nD. (P-MC)/MC\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. (MC-P)/MC. \n\nMarket power, or monopoly pricing, is a measure of a firm's ability to charge a price higher than marginal cost (MC) due to its dominant position in the market. This is often represented by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is calculated as the sum of the squared market share of each firm in the market. A lower HHI value represents a more concentrated market, while a higher HHI value represents a more fragmented market. \n\nTo calculate market power, we can use the following formula:\n\nMarket Power = (MC-P)/(MC)\n\nwhere MC is the marginal cost of production, P is the price of the product, and Market Power is a measure of the firm's ability to charge a price higher than marginal cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",
