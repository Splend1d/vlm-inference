So, we need to look at the options and see which one makes the most sense.\n\nA. The norms of a society: This could be a possibility, but Anscombe is a philosopher, not a sociologist. It's also possible that the norms of a society are not the main focus of her discussion.\n\nB. The feelings of an individual: This is unlikely, as Anscombe is a philosopher and not a psychologist or other expert in human emotions.\n\nC. The commands of God: This is also unlikely, as Anscombe is a philosopher and not a religious expert.\n\nD. No real concept at all: This is unlikely, as Anscombe is a philosopher and has a lot to say about moral obligations.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the best answer is:\n\nA. the norms of a society.",
