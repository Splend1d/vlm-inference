Thymine\nB. Adenine\nC. Uracil\nD. Guanine\n\nassistant:All of the options listed (A, B, C, and D) are nucleotide bases that are commonly found in nucleic acids. Thymine (A), Adenine (B), Uracil (C), and Guanine (D) are all important components of DNA and RNA. Thymine and Adenine are purine bases, while uracil and guanine are pyrimidine bases.\n\nHowever, uracil is the only one of these nucleotide bases that is found in RNA, while all of the others are found in DNA. Thymine is replaced by another nucleotide base called uracil in RNA, which is why uracil is the correct answer.",
