The defendant has pleaded not guilty, claiming that he made an honest mistake as to the date the expenses were paid. At trial, the prosecutor offers evidence of the defendant's involvement in an earlier scheme to help a different client falsify tax returns in the same way. Is the evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is impermissible character evidence.\nB. No, because it is not relevant to the issues in this case.\nC. Yes, to show absence of mistake.\nD. Yes, to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.\n\nassistant:The evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme is admissible to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime. This is because it demonstrates a pattern of behavior that suggests the defendant is likely to have committed the current fraud as well.\n\nIn legal terms, this would be referred to as \"prior bad acts\" evidence, which is generally admissible in court as long as it is relevant to the issues at hand and does not unfairly prejudice the defendant. In this case, the prosecutor would argue that the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme is relevant to the issue of intent, as it shows that the defendant had a propensity to commit the crime of fraud.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.",
