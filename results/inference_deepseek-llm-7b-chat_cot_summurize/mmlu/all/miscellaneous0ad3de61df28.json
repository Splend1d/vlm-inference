This is because the observable universe is about 100 billion light-years in diameter, and the speed of light is about 186,000 miles per second. Therefore, the observable universe is about 10^22 seconds old. The lifetime of a typical star is about 10^8 seconds, so the observable universe has been around long enough for the light from stars to reach Earth. However, only a small fraction of the observable universe has been observed and catalogued, so the percentage of the observable universe that has received radio transmissions from Earth is very small.",
