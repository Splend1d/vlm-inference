What is the total number of apple pies that the bakers can make?\n\nA. 33\nB. 38\nC. 39\nD. 40\n\nassistant:To find the total number of apple pies the bakers can make, you need to calculate the number of apples available and divide it by the number of apples used per pie.\n\nNumber of apples available = 15 boxes * 18 apples per box = 270 apples\n\nNumber of apples used per pie = 7 apples\n\nTotal number of pies = 270 apples / 7 apples per pie = 38 pies\n\nSo, the bakers can make a total of 38 apple pies.
