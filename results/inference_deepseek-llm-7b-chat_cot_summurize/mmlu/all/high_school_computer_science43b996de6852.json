It returns True if all the characters in the string are uppercase, and False otherwise.\n\nThe other options are not related to checking if all characters in a string are uppercase. B. join(seq) concatenates a sequence of strings or characters into a single string. C. len(string) returns the number of characters in a string. D. ljust(width[, fillchar]) left justifies a string and returns a new string with a specified width.",
