Virtually all small-scale producers are engage in some self-provisioning and market sales.\n\nExplanation: This answer option is the most accurate and comprehensive answer to the question. While it is true that many developing-country farmers engage in subsistence production, a significant number also sell their produce on the market. This answer option acknowledges this dual role and provides a balance between the two.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the number of subsistence farmers, while option B is incorrect because it overstates the number of commercial farmers. Option D is not a comprehensive answer to the question, as it only provides information about the percentage of farmers engaging in pure subsistence production.",
