A 25 g sample of a liquid was heated to 95 \u00b0C and then quickly transferred to an insulated container holding 100 g of water at 26 \u00b0C.\n\n2. The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\n\nThis option is not necessarily true. The sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature because the sample was heated to a higher initial temperature.\n\nB. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n\nThis option is not relevant to the situation. The final temperature is not less than the average starting temperatures, so the equilibrium constant cannot be determined from this information.\n\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\n\nThis option is not necessarily true. The heat capacity of a material is the amount of heat energy required to increase the temperature of 1 g of the material by 1 \u00b0C. Since the sample and the water were heated to different initial temperatures, the sample will require more heat energy to reach the same temperature as the water. However, this does not necessarily mean that the heat capacity of the sample is greater than the heat capacity of the water.\n\nD. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.\n\nThis option is true. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted. Since the sample and the water were in contact, the heat energy transferred from the sample to the water must have been equal. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature, but this does not affect the conservation of energy.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.",
