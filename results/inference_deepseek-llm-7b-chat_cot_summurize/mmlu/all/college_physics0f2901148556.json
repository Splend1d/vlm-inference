If the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is increased by a factor of\n\nA. 2\nB. 4\nC. 8\nD. 16\n\nassistant:To determine the answer to this question, we need to use the relationship between temperature and the mass of ice that can be melted in a given amount of time.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the rate of heat transfer, which is given by:\n\nQ = mc\u0394T\n\nwhere Q is the rate of heat transfer, m is the mass of the material being heated, c is the specific heat capacity of the material, and \u0394T is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, we have a cavity with a certain amount of electromagnetic energy (EM energy) that is in equilibrium, and this energy is used to melt the ice. We can assume that the specific heat capacity of ice is constant at \u223c1 x 10^3 J/(kg*K), and that the initial temperature of the cavity is 0 K (absolute zero).\n\nNow, let's consider the two scenarios:\n\n1. The Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two:\n\nIf the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the change in temperature \u0394T would be 2 x 2 = 4 K.\n\nThe rate of heat transfer Q is proportional to the specific heat capacity c and the change in temperature \u0394T:\n\nQ = c\u0394T\n\nTherefore, the rate of heat transfer in the increased temperature scenario would be:\n\nQ\\_new = (1 x 10^3 J/(kg*K)) x (4 K) = 4 x 10^3 J/(kg*K)\n\nNow, let's find the mass of ice that can be melted in a given time for the increased temperature scenario:\n\nm = Q\\_new / (EM energy)\n\nSince the EM energy remains constant in the cavity, we can express m as:\n\nm\\_new = (4 x 10^3 J/(kg*K)) / (EM energy)\n\nNow, let's compare this mass with the initial mass of ice m\\_initial:\n\nm\\_initial = (Q / (EM energy)) / c\n\nm\\_initial = (1 / c) x Q / (EM energy)\n\nSince the EM energy remains constant in the cavity, we can express m\\_initial as:\n\nm\\_initial = (1 / c) x Q\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the masses:\n\nratio = m\\_new / m\\_initial\n\nratio = (4 x 10^3 J/(kg*K)) / (1 / c) x Q\n\nratio = 4 x 10^3 / c x Q\n\nratio = 4 x 10^3\n\nSince the ratio of the masses is 4, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time would increase by a factor of 4 when the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 4",
