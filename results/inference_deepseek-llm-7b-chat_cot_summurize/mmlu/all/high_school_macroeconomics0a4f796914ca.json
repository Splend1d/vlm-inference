An increase in the real rate of interest\nB. An increase in taxes\nC. A decrease in net exports\nD. An increase in government spending\n\nassistant:To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. An increase in the real rate of interest: A higher real rate of interest may attract more investment, leading to an increase in production and, ultimately, an increase in real GDP. So, this option could increase real GDP.\n\nB. An increase in taxes: An increase in taxes may reduce consumption and investment, which can hinder economic growth. Therefore, this option is less likely to increase real GDP.\n\nC. A decrease in net exports: A decrease in net exports may reduce the amount of goods and services being produced and sold, which could negatively impact real GDP. Therefore, this option is also less likely to increase real GDP.\n\nD. An increase in government spending: An increase in government spending can increase demand and consumption, encouraging businesses to produce more goods and services. This, in turn, can lead to an increase in real GDP.\n\nBased on this analysis, option D (An increase in government spending) is the most likely to increase real GDP. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",
