When the sound exits the first medium and enters a denser medium, all of the following changes EXCEPT:\n\nA. velocity\nB. intensity\nC. frequency\nD. wavelength\n\nassistant:When a sound wave enters a denser medium, it slows down. Therefore, the velocity of the sound wave decreases. This change does not affect the intensity, frequency, or wavelength of the sound wave. The intensity of a sound wave remains the same because it is a property of the sound source, not the wave itself. The frequency of a sound wave remains the same because it is determined by the source and does not change with the change in medium. The wavelength of a sound wave also remains the same because it is determined by the source and does not change with the change in medium.",
