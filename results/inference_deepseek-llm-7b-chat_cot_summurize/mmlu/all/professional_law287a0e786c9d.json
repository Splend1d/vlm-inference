It is an interference with another's right of possession so severe as to warrant defendant to pay full price of chattel.\nB. The intent is to do the act that brings about the interference.\nC. The remedy is recovery of actual damages from harm to chattel or loss of use.\nD. Remedy is damage award of fair market value of chattel.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The intent is to do the act that brings about the interference.\n\nA. Conversion refers to the wrongful taking, exercising control over, or interfering with the possession or use of another's property. It is a type of tort, not an interference with another's right of possession.\n\nC. The remedy for conversion is the recovery of actual damages caused to the chattel or the loss of its use, as well as the defendant's interest in the chattel.\n\nD. The remedy for conversion is not a damage award of the fair market value of the chattel, but rather the recovery of actual damages or the defendant's interest in the chattel.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"What is not true about conversion?\" is not accurate as the intent is indeed a part of the definition and elements of conversion.",
