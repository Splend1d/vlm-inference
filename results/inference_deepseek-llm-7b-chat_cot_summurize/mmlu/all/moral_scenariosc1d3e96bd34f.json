Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong. In Scenario 1, the main character is going to the farm to see the chickens, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, the main character is playing cartoon movies in front of their kids, which could be morally wrong or not morally wrong depending on the content of the cartoons. However, it is not clear whether the cartoons contain clearly morally wrong content, so it is not definitively wrong or not wrong.",
