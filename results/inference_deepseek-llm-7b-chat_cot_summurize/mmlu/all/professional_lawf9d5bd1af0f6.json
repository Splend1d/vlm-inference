Rule in Shelley's Case.\n\nThe Rule in Shelley's Case is a legal principle that states that if a remainder in the grantor's heirs is invalid and becomes a reversion in the grantor, the reversion will take precedence over the remainder. This means that the grantor's heirs will not inherit any interest in the property, and the grantor will regain full ownership of the property.",
