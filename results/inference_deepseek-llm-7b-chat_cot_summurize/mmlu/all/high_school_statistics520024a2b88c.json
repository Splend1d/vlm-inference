Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\n\nassistant:The correct interpretation of the interval is B. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThe storekeeper conducted a survey among 200 customers, with 100 female customers and 120 male customers. He asked them if they are interested in shopping at the store on Sundays. He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" for both genders and found that 84 of the 100 female customers (84/100) were interested in shopping on Sundays, while 109 of the 120 male customers (109/120) were interested in shopping on Sundays (109/120).\n\nTo calculate the difference in interest between male and female customers, we subtract the proportion of female customers from the proportion of male customers: (109/120) - (84/100) = 0.15.\n\nThe 95 percent confidence interval for the difference in interest between male and female customers is calculated as follows:\n\nLower limit: (0.15 - 0.23) = -0.08\nUpper limit: (0.15 - 0.18) = -0.03\n\nSince the lower limit of the interval is negative, it is correct to interpret the interval as \"We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\"",
