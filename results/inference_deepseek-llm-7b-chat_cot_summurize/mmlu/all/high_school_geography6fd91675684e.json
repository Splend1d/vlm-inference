Positional dispute\n\nassistant:The condition that occurs when the people of one state want to annex a territory whose population is ethnically related to that state's population but now under the rule of another state is called \"Irredentism\". This term refers to a political and cultural movement that seeks to unite a people who share a common identity, history, or culture, regardless of their geographical location. In this case, the people of one state want to reunite with their fellow citizens who live in a territory under the control of another state. This movement is driven by a sense of nationalism and often results in conflicts between the states involved.",
