S\u2013O\nB. P\u2013F\nC. C\u2013B\nD. C\u2013N\n\nassistant:To determine the bond polarity, we need to consider the electronegativity difference between the two atoms in the bond. The greater the electronegativity difference, the more polar the bond.\n\nA. S\u2013O (sulfur-oxygen bond) has an electronegativity difference of 0.6 and is moderately polar.\n\nB. P\u2013F (phosphorus-fluorine bond) has an electronegativity difference of 1.9 and is highly polar.\n\nC. C\u2013B (carbon-boron bond) has an electronegativity difference of 0.9 and is moderately polar.\n\nD. C\u2013N (carbon-nitrogen bond) has an electronegativity difference of 0.4 and is slightly polar.\n\nTherefore, the bond with the largest polarity is P\u2013F (P-F bond), with an electronegativity difference of 1.9.",
