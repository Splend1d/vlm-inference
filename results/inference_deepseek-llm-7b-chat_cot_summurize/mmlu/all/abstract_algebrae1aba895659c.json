Statement 2 | Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Q is an extension field of Z_2.\nThis statement is false. A field extension is a field Q that contains a finite set of elements from a given field F. In this case, Q is an extension field of Z_2, which means that Q contains all elements of the additive group of the integers modulo 2. However, Z_2 is a field, not an extension field of Z_2.\n\nStatement 2: Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\nThis statement is true. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one root, which can be an element of any extension field of the field of coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
