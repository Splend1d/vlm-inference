Yes, because art works and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.\n\nThe court is likely to reject this witness as being qualified to authenticate the paintings in question because the museum curator who housed the paintings should be the one to identify if these are in fact the paintings that were stolen. The official custodian of the paintings is the museum curator, and therefore, it is their responsibility to authenticate the paintings. The prosecution's witness, the professor of art history, may be able to authenticate the paintings to some extent, but it is not enough to establish their provenance and ownership. Therefore, the court is more likely to accept the testimony of the museum curator as more reliable and authoritative.\n\nB. No, because an outside person may be able to partially authenticate the painting but he can't say whether it is the one that was in the museum or that was stolen.\nC. No, granting the objection will simply waste the court's time if the court has to bring in the museum curator and go through hoops to authenticate the paintings.\nD. No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify that it is the genuine piece of art in question.\n\nThese answers are incorrect because they either do not address the issue of the museum curator's authority to authenticate the paintings, or they imply that the court should not waste time bringing in the museum curator to authenticate the paintings. The correct answer A, however, addresses the issue and suggests that the court is more likely to accept the testimony of the museum curator as more reliable and authoritative.",
