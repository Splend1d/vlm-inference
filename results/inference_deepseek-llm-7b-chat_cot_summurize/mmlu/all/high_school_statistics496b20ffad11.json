Between 38% and 48% of those surveyed expressed fear about going to school.\nD. There is a 0.05 probability that the 43% result is in error.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\n\nThe margin of error in a poll is the range within which the true proportion of the population is expected to fall. In this case, the margin of error is 5%, meaning that if the poll were repeated, we could expect the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school to be between 38% and 48%.\n\nB is incorrect because 5% of the students refusing to participate does not directly relate to the margin of error.\n\nC is incorrect because it refers to the surveyed population rather than the true population.\n\nD is incorrect because it refers to the probability of the poll result being in error, not the range within which the true proportion is expected to fall.",
