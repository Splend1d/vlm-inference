If 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the detector will detect photons\n\nA. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4\nB. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3\nC. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 1\nD. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.1\n\nassistant:The answer is A.\n\nThe quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the probability that the detector will detect a photon. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that on average, the detector will detect 10% of the incoming photons. Since 100 photons are sent into the detector, the detector will detect an average of 10 photons.\n\nThe rms deviation is a measure of the variability of the detected photons. In this case, the rms deviation is about 4, which means that the number of detected photons will vary by about 4 units from the average of 10.\n\nTherefore, the detector will detect photons on average 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4.\nThe answer B, C and D are incorrect because they have different values for the rms deviation.",
