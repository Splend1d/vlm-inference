The volume of the solid is\n\nA. 8\nB. 16\nC. 20\nD. 32\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the solid. The base of the solid is the region bounded by the two equations x^2 = 4y and y = 2. We can find the points of intersection by setting x^2 = 4y equal to y = 2:\n\nx^2 = 4y\ny = 2\n\nSolving the second equation for y:\n\ny = 2\n\nNow we can substitute y = 2 into the first equation to find the x-coordinates of the points of intersection:\n\nx^2 = 4(2)\nx^2 = 8\nx = \u00b12\n\nSo the points of intersection are (2, 2) and (-2, 2). The base of the solid is a square with side length 2, and the height of the solid is 2. Therefore, the volume of the solid is (base area)(height) = (2 * 2^2)(2) = 20.\n\nThe answer is C.",
