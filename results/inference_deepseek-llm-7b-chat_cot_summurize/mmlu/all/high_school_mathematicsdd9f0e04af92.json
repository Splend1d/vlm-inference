A marble is selected and not replaced, then a second is selected. What is the probability that both are the same color?\n\nA. \\frac{1}{8}\nB. \\frac{8}{15}\nC. \\frac{1}{15}\nD. \\frac{7}{15}\n\nassistant:To calculate the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color, we can break down the problem into two cases: selecting two red marbles and selecting two blue marbles.\n\n1. Selecting two red marbles:\n- There are 4 red marbles out of a total of 10.\n- The probability of selecting the first red marble is 4/10.\n- After the first marble is selected, there are 3 red marbles left out of a total of 9 marbles.\n- The probability of selecting the second red marble is 3/8.\n\nMultiplying the probabilities together, we get (4/10) \\* (3/8) = 3/10.\n\n2. Selecting two blue marbles:\n- There are 6 blue marbles out of a total of 10.\n- The probability of selecting the first blue marble is 6/10.\n- After the first marble is selected, there are 5 blue marbles left out of a total of 9 marbles.\n- The probability of selecting the second blue marble is 5/8.\n\nMultiplying the probabilities together, we get (6/10) \\* (5/8) = 30/40 = 3/4.\n\nSince the problem asks for the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color, we need to add the probabilities for both cases.\n\n3. (Probability of selecting two red marbles) + (Probability of selecting two blue marbles) = 3/10 + 3/4 = 6/10 + 15/40 = 6/10 + 3/10 = 9/10.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color is 9/10, which corresponds to answer choice D.",
