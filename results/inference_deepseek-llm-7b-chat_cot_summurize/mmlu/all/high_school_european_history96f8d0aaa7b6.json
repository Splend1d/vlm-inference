Collectivization\nB. Persecution of the better-off peasants\nC. The Berlin blockade\nD. The five-year plans\n\nassistant:The question asks which of the given policies was NOT used by Joseph Stalin to correct the problem cited by Vladimir Lenin in his speech. The problem cited by Lenin was the need for a fast rate of development of the Soviet industry and the need to gradually move away from a small commodity economy to a large-scale production economy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Collectivization: This policy was implemented by Stalin to consolidate agricultural lands into collectives, such as state farms and kolkhozes. This was a step towards increasing the scale of production and away from the small commodity economy.\n\nB. Persecution of the better-off peasants: This policy was not directly related to the problem cited by Lenin. It was part of Stalin's policies to consolidate power and suppress opposition, but it did not focus on the need for a fast rate of development of the industry or the need to move away from a small commodity economy.\n\nC. The Berlin blockade: This was a political move by Stalin, not a policy to correct the problem cited by Lenin. It was a response to Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 and was not directly related to the need for a fast rate of development of the industry or the need to move away from a small commodity economy.\n\nD. The five-year plans: These were economic plans implemented by Stalin to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union. They focused on increasing production and investment in heavy industries, which was directly related to the need for a fast rate of development of the industry cited by Lenin.\n\nBased on this analysis, the policy of persecution of the better-off peasants was NOT used by Stalin to correct the problem cited by Lenin. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Persecution of the better-off peasants.",
