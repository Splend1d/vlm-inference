For example, when the ball is at the highest point of the circle, \u03b8 = 90 degrees, and the string tension is maximum. As the ball moves down the circle, the angle \u03b8 decreases, and the string tension decreases.\n\nTherefore, the string tension may be greater or less than mg depending on the speed of the ball.",
