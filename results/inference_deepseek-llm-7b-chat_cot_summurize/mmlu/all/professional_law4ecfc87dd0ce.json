The evidence provided by the ship's owner is a custom, and customs can be rebutted in a negligence action. The court should consider the specific circumstances of this case and evaluate whether the ship's owner exercised reasonable care to prevent the longshoreman's death. The jury should be instructed that while the custom may be relevant, it is not conclusive on the issue of negligence. The jury should then determine whether the ship's owner breached the duty of care owed to the longshoreman, and whether this breach of duty was the direct cause of the longshoreman's death.",
