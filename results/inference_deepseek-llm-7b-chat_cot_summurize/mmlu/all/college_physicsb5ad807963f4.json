The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\n\nA. L_B = 4L_A\nB. L_B = 2L_A\nC. L_B = L_A\nD. L_B = 1/2 L_A\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given information and use physics equations to determine the correct answer.\n\nLet's denote the length of pendulum A as L_A, and the length of pendulum B as L_B.\n\nThe period T of a simple pendulum is given by the formula:\n\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g)\n\nwhere L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nAccording to the problem, the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A:\n\nT_B = 2 * T_A\n\nSince T_B = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) and T_A = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g), we can write:\n\n2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2 * 2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\u221a(L_B/g) = \u221a(L_A/g)\n\nNow, let's consider the period of the oscillations of the masses. The period of oscillations is related to the length of the pendulum by the following equation:\n\nT_osc = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g)\n\nSince the masses oscillate in equal gravitational fields, we have:\n\nT_osc_A = T_osc_B\n\nThus,\n\n2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g)\n\nWe can substitute the previous equation (\u221a(L_B/g) = \u221a(L_A/g)) into the second equation:\n\n2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1 = 1\n\nNow, let's look at the options given:\n\nA. L_B = 4L_A\nB. L_B = 2L_A\nC. L_B = L_A\nD. L_B = 1/2 L_A\n\nNone of the options directly matches our derived equation. However, we can make an educated guess based on the options.\n\nOption B suggests that L_B = 2L_A, which could be a valid scenario if we assume that L_A is half of L_B. This would mean that the period of oscillation is twice as long for pendulum A, which matches the initial given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{B: L_B = 2L_A}}$.",
