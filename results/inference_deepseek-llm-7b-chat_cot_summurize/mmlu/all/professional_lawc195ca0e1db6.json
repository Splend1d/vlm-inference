Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable, and continuous \u0080\u0093 an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.\n\nThe court is likely to issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbor's problems. This is because the club's activities are causing a substantial, unreasonable, and continuous nuisance for the neighbors. The court may consider the club's approval based on a grandfather clause, but this does not absolve the club from responsibility for controlling its customers' behavior. The neighbor's right to use and enjoy their property without interference is a significant legal right, and the court may find that the club's activities constitute a nuisance that must be abated.",
