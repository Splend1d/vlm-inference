When daylight-saving time is observed in New York, it is 1 hour ahead of Honolulu.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time in Honolulu during noon in New York:\n\nNew York is currently 12:00 PM (noon) during daylight-saving time.\n\nNew York is 1 hour ahead of Honolulu, so Honolulu is currently 1:00 PM (noon + 1 hour).\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 8:00 AM.",
