H2Se > H2O > H2S\nB. H2S > H2Se > H2O\nC. H2O < H2S < H2Se\nD. H2Se > H2S > H2O\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of bond strength and acid strength.\n\nBond strength is a measure of the stability of a chemical bond. It is related to acid strength, which is a measure of the reactivity of a molecule with water or other nucleophiles. Generally, the stronger the bond strength, the weaker the acid strength.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\nA. H2Se > H2O > H2S\nH2Se has a stronger bond strength than H2O, which is a stronger acid than H2S. This option is correct.\n\nB. H2S > H2Se > H2O\nH2S has a weaker bond strength than H2O, which is a weaker acid than H2Se. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. H2O < H2S < H2Se\nH2O has a stronger bond strength than H2S, which is a stronger acid than H2Se. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. H2Se > H2S > H2O\nH2Se has a stronger bond strength than H2S, which is a weaker acid than H2O. This option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. H2Se > H2O > H2S.",
