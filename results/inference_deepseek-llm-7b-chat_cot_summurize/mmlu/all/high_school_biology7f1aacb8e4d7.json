The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is NAD+.\nD. ATP is formed because an endergonic reaction is coupled with an exergonic reaction.\n\nassistant:D. ATP is formed because an endergonic reaction is coupled with an exergonic reaction.\n\nDuring cellular respiration, the endergonic reaction of oxidative phosphorylation (where protons are pumped through ATP synthase) is coupled with an exergonic reaction (the oxidation of glucose and other nutrients). This coupling leads to the production of ATP through the process of chemiosmosis. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Most CO2 produced during cellular respiration is released from the Krebs cycle, not glycolysis.\nB. Protons are not pumped through ATP synthase by active transport, but rather by the energy released from the electron transport chain.\nC. NAD+ is not the final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain, oxygen is.",
