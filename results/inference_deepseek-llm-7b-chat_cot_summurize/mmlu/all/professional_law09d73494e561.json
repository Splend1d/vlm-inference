At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal.

Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.\n\nassistant:The evidence offered by the prosecutor is not admissible under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule. The learned treatise exception allows for the introduction of an expert's opinion based on the teachings of a treatise, but it only applies when the treatise is offered into evidence by a qualified expert. Since the prosecutor is not calling any witnesses, he cannot rely on the teachings of a treatise to establish the defendant's state of mind or intent. Therefore, the correct answer is A. No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.",
