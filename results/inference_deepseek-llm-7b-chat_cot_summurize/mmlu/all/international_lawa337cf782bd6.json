Resolution 678 is narrower than the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter\n\nUNSC Resolution 678 was a collective security measure adopted by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It authorized member states to take all necessary measures to restore peace and security in the Gulf region. However, this authorization was limited to collective self-defense, meaning that member states could only act in response to an imminent threat to the security of a member state of the coalition. The inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter allows any state to take necessary measures to protect its own security when faced with an immediate threat. Therefore, Resolution 678 is narrower than the inherent right of self-defense, as it only authorizes collective self-defense, not individual self-defense.",
