In other words, you need to find the complement of 40\u00b0.\n\nThe complement of an angle is the angle that, when added to the given angle, gives a total of 90\u00b0. \n\nSo, to find the complement of 40\u00b0, you need to subtract 40\u00b0 from 90\u00b0, which gives you 50\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The supplement of a 40\u00b0 angle is 50\u00b0.",
