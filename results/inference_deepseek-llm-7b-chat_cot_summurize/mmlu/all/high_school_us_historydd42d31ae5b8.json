His argument was based on the idea that these individuals were American citizens and deserved equal rights. The passage he wrote suggests that the issue should be taken to the U.S. Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of the laws affecting free people of color.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, explicitly prohibits states from denying citizens their \"equal protection of the laws.\" This amendment was a direct response to the issue of race and citizenship that Garrison was addressing. The amendment granted citizenship to former slaves, and it also granted African Americans equal protection under the law.\n\nThe other options are not the correct answer for the following reasons:\n\nA. The Emancipation Proclamation (1863) was a presidential proclamation that declared all slaves in the Confederate states to be free. While it had an impact on the issue of slavery, it did not address the rights of free people of color.\n\nB. The Reconstruction Act of 1867 was a federal law that established the process for the readmission of former Confederate states into the Union. It did not address the rights of free people of color.\n\nD. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was a federal law that prohibited discrimination based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. However, this law was enacted after the Fourteenth Amendment, which already addressed the issue of citizenship and equal protection.",
