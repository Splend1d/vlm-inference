The department randomly selects several locations in the park, gets soil samples from those locations, and tests the samples for their lead levels.

Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit\nC. Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit\nD. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit.\n\nA type I error, also known as a false positive, occurs when the null hypothesis (in this case, that the lead levels are within the allowed limit) is rejected when it is true. In this scenario, the Department of Health tests the soil samples from several locations in the park, and if any of the lead levels exceed the allowed limit, the park is closed. If the lead levels exceed the allowed limit at any of the locations, the null hypothesis (that the lead levels are within the allowed limit) is not true, and a type I error occurs (the park is closed when it should not have been).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would result from a type II error (a false negative), which occurs when the null hypothesis is accepted when it is false (i.e., the park is kept open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit).\n\nOption D is incorrect because it would result from a type II error (a false negative), which occurs when the null hypothesis is accepted when it is false (i.e., the park is kept open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit).\n\nOption B is incorrect because it is the opposite of the correct answer (closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit).",
