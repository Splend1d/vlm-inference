Moe\nB. Larry\nC. Curly\nD. Shemp\n\nassistant:The Three Stooges were a comedy team consisting of Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard. The team was active from 1925 to 1970. Curly Howard, the youngest of the three, was Moe Howard's nephew, making them related. Larry Fine and Moe Howard were brothers, making them related as well. Therefore, Shemp Howard, who replaced Curly when he passed away in 1952, was not related to the other members of the Three Stooges. So, the correct answer is D. Shemp.",
