No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n\nassistant:In order to answer this question, I will consider the elements of agency and the concept of apparent authority.\n\nStep 1: Identify the roles and responsibilities of the businessperson, assistant, and third party.\n- The businessperson is the principal who sent the assistant to represent him at the conference.\n- The assistant is the employee who negotiated a deal on behalf of the principal.\n- The third party is the party with whom the assistant negotiated a deal.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the facts provided.\n- The assistant was given materials to set up a table and was authorized to represent the principal.\n- The assistant presented herself as an official representative of the principal to third parties.\n- The assistant negotiated a deal on behalf of the principal.\n- The principal refused to honor the deal that was negotiated.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options provided.\n- A. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n- B. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\n- C. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\n- D. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is C. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent. The reason for this is that the third party had a duty to inquire whether the assistant was authorized to negotiate on the principal's behalf, and they did not do so. Additionally, the principal's refusal to honor the deal indicates that the deal was not valid in the first place.",
