Which of the following is the minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs?\n\nA. 50\nB. 208/5\nC. 92/5\nD. 10\n\nassistant:To find the minimum average completion time of these jobs, we need to find the shortest completion time for all five jobs. We can do this by calculating the sum of the service times and dividing by the number of jobs:\n\nSum of service times = 25 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 60\nNumber of jobs = 5\n\nAverage completion time = Sum of service times / Number of jobs\nAverage completion time = 60 / 5\nAverage completion time = 12\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the average completion time is 12, which is not listed in the given options.",
