The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. Is the son's ownership interest enforceable in the face of the claim by the two non-selling sisters that they own 100% of the property pursuant to the law regarding joint tenancies?\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n",

Only a will can create a joint tenancy, and the deed was invalid for that purpose, resulting in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Each joint tenant does not own an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, and the attempted conveyance of a one-third interest is valid.\n\nC. The conveyance severed the joint tenancy is incorrect, as the deed itself did not create a tenancy in common. The third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son, but this does not invalidate the joint tenancy.\n\nD. The selling sister did not need to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy, as the deed itself created a tenancy in common by operation of law.",
