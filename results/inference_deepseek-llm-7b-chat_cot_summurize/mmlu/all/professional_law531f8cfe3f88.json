The neighbor's testimony is not considered impermissible evidence of character to show the defendant's plaintiff's conduct on a particular occasion. Instead, it is probative of the plaintiff's habit of crossing the street outside the crosswalk, which could be relevant to the issue of whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. Additionally, the fact that the neighbor is not an eyewitness to the accident does not necessarily render her testimony inadmissible. Ultimately, the admissibility of the neighbor's testimony will depend on the specific rules of evidence that apply in the jurisdiction in which the trial is taking place.",
