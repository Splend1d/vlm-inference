However, none of the given options are correct. Enzyme assays are primarily used for carrier screening, which involves identifying individuals who carry a genetic mutation but do not have the disorder themselves.\n\nCarrier screening is typically performed for genetic disorders that are autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to have the disorder. Examples of such disorders include cystic fibrosis, fragile X syndrome, and Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nCarrier testing can be performed through various methods, including blood tests, saliva tests, or cheek swabs. The results of the test can help individuals and their families make informed decisions about reproductive options, such as prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis.\n\nTo summarize, enzyme assays can be used to identify carriers of genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, fragile X syndrome, and Tay-Sachs disease. However, the specific disorder is not provided in the given options.",
