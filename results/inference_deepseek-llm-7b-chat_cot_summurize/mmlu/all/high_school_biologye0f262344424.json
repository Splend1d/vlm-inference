This theory was developed by Georges Cuvier, a French naturalist, as a way to explain the presence of fossils and other geological phenomena.\n\nCuvier's catastrophism was an alternative to the prevailing view of the time, which was known as uniformitarianism. Uniformitarianism, which was developed by James Hutton and others, held that the Earth's processes had been operating in much the same way for a very long time, and that the geological features we see today had formed gradually over long periods of time.\n\nIn contrast, Cuvier's catastrophism posited that the Earth had experienced a series of major geological and meteorological events, which had led to the formation of the Earth's features as we see them today. Cuvier believed that these catastrophes had occurred on a regular basis, and that they had played a significant role in shaping the Earth's surface.\n\nTherefore, Cuvier's catastrophism was an attempt to explain the existence of the fossil record, which was the evidence of past life forms that had been preserved in the Earth's rocks. The fossil record provided evidence of the variety of life forms that had existed in the past, and of the changes that had occurred over time. Cuvier believed that these changes had been caused by the regular occurrence of catastrophes, which had led to the extinction of some species and the emergence of others.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. the fossil record.",
