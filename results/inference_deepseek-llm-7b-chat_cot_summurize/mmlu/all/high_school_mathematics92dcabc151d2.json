We have:\n\n$2^{1001}-1 = 2^{1001}-1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^5-1} = 1 \\pmod{31}$\n\n$2^{1012}-1 = 2^{1012}-1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^5-1} = 1 \\pmod{31}$\n\nSince both numbers are congruent to 1 modulo 31, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the greatest common divisor. The answer is 31, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
