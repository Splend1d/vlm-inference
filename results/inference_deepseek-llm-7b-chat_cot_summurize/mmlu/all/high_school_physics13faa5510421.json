What force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate?\n\nA. Static friction\nB. Kinetic friction\nC. The normal force of the hill on the sphere\nD. Gravity\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Gravity. The force that provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate is gravity. When the sphere starts from rest atop the hill, the normal force of the hill on the sphere is also at rest. The kinetic friction and static friction between the sphere and the hill are also at rest. Therefore, none of these forces are causing the rotation of the sphere. Instead, the force that is causing the rotation of the sphere is the force of gravity. This is because the weight of the sphere is acting down the incline, causing it to rotate.",
