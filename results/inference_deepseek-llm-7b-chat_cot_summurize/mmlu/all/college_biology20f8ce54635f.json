Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization.\nC. Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\n\nThese three options are related to the process of fertilization and involve the interaction between sperm and egg. In the first two options, the antibodies or ZP3 bind to the sperm or egg, respectively, which prevents the sperm from initiating the acrosomal reaction, thus blocking in vitro fertilization.\n\nD. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\n\nThis option does not involve the process of fertilization, and the presence of ZP2 does not interact with the sperm's ZP3 receptors. Therefore, it does not affect the acrosomal reaction and in vitro fertilization.",
