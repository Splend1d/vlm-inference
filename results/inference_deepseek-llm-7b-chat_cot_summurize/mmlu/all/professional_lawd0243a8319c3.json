In this case, the drainage system is a right that the man's friend and cousin have to use the underground pipeline that extends across all three parcels of land.\n\nOption A, easement appurtenant, refers to an easement that accompanies the ownership of land, such as a right of way or a drainage system. Since the friend and cousin do not own the land under the pipeline, it is not an easement appurtenant.\n\nOption B, easement by implication, refers to an easement that can be inferred from the use of land. However, the friend and cousin have not implied the use of the drainage system, so it is not an easement by implication.\n\nOption C, prescriptive easement, refers to an easement that is established by the continuous and open use of another's land for a specified period of time. The friend and cousin have not established a prescriptive easement.\n\nOption D, express easement, refers to an easement that is established by a written or oral agreement. However, the man's drainage system was not established by an express easement.\n\nTherefore, the drainage system is most likely defined as an easement appurtenant.",
