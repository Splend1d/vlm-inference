The stage of the scheme is not the determining factor, as the act of giving the counterfeit card has already taken place. The dealer's claim that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt would not be valid.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they all suggest that the courier was either an accomplice or an innocent agent, but this information does not affect the dealer's attempt to commit fraud.",
