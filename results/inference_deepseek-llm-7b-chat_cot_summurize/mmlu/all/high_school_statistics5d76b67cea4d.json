Students in the first class generally scored higher than students in the second class.\nWe don't have any information about the total number of students in the classes or the maximum score. Therefore, we cannot determine if one class scored higher than the other.\n\nB. Students in the second class generally scored higher than students in the first class.\nWe don't have any information about the total number of students in the classes or the maximum score. Therefore, we cannot determine if one class scored higher than the other.\n\nC. A score at the 20th percentile for the first class is at the 40th percentile for the second class.\nSince the first class has a score at the 40th percentile, this option is not possible.\n\nD. A score at the 50th percentile for the first class is at the 90th percentile for the second class.\nIf a score at the 50th percentile for the first class is at the 90th percentile for the second class, it means that a score at the 50th percentile in the first class is better than a score at the 90th percentile in the second class. This could suggest that students in the first class are doing better than those in the second class.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the most reasonable conclusion.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
