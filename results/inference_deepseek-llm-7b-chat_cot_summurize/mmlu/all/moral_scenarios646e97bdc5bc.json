Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character fills the gas tank without telling their friend. While this may be seen as dishonest, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. People can sometimes borrow things without permission, and it is not considered morally wrong to fill a gas tank without telling someone.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is sharing their lice-infested hairbrush with their sister. This is morally wrong because it could potentially harm their sister by spreading lice.",
