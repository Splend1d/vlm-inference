This means that the direction of the vibrations is at right angles to the direction of the wave.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either describe the direction of the vibrations in relation to the wave (perpendicular to the wave in option B, which is incorrect) or do not describe the direction of the vibrations at all (option C, which is also incorrect).",
