Elbow fracture.\nC. Finger fracture.\nD. Fracture of the radius and ulna at the wrist.\n\nassistant:A colles fracture is a type of wrist fracture that involves the distal radius and the ulna. It is also known as a Smith's fracture or Salter-Harris type 4 fracture. The distal radius and ulna are the two bones in the forearm that form the wrist joint. In a colles fracture, the distal radius is broken and displaced posteriorly (towards the back) and the ulna is often fractured as well. This type of fracture is typically caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand, and is more common in older adults.",
