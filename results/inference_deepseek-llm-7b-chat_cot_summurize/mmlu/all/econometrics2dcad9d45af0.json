It is not possible to determine the value of the autocovariances without knowing the disturbance variance.\n\nIn an MA(1) process, the autocovariance at lag 1 is given by the moving average coefficient (0.4) multiplied by the disturbance variance. Without knowing the disturbance variance, it is not possible to determine the value of the autocovariance at lag 1.",
