The reason for this is that the difference between the bid and the actual bid was so significant that it would be unfair for the homeowner to rely on the bid that was sent. The other options do not apply in this case, as the homeowner was not aware of the mistake, the telegraph company is not liable as an independent contractor, and the homeowner did not have an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.",
