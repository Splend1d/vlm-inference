If the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet, and the tank is 30 feet tall, how much water would the tank contain when it is full?\n\nA. 1725 ft^3\nB. 1740 ft^3\nC. 3480 ft^3\nD. 6960 ft^3\n\nassistant:To find the volume of the triangular prism, we first need to determine the dimensions of the prism. Since the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet, we can find the height of the triangular base by using the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n116 = (1/2) * base * height\n\nTo solve for the height, we can multiply both sides by 2 and divide by (1/2):\nheight = 2 * 116 / (1/2) = 232 feet\n\nNow that we have the height of the triangular base, we can find the dimensions of the prism:\n\nBase area = 116 square feet\nHeight = 232 feet\n\nThe length and width of the triangular base are both 1/2 the height, so:\n\nLength = (1/2) * 232 = 116 feet\nWidth = (1/2) * 232 = 116 feet\n\nThe height of the triangular prism is the same as the height of the triangular base, which we already determined to be 232 feet.\n\nNow we can find the volume of the triangular prism:\n\nVolume = (1/2) * base area * height\nVolume = (1/2) * 116 * 232\nVolume = 12568 ft^3\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 6960 ft^3.",
