Yes, because the defendant has a right to exclude all persons who may be called as government witnesses.\n\nassistant:C. Yes, because the agent's testimony might be influenced by the testimony of other witnesses.\n\nThe defendant's motion should be granted because the agent's testimony might be influenced by the testimony of other witnesses. The defendant's motion is based on the argument that the agent's presence might be affected by the testimony of other witnesses, which could potentially affect the agent's credibility and the outcome of the trial. Therefore, the defendant's motion should be granted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the presence of the agent is not essential to the presentation of the government's case. The government can present its case without the agent's testimony.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the government does not have a right to have its designated representative remain in the courtroom throughout the trial. The court can grant or deny the defendant's motion based on the specific circumstances of the case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the defendant does not have a right to exclude all persons who may be called as government witnesses. The defendant's motion is specifically regarding the agent's presence, not the presence of other government witnesses.",
