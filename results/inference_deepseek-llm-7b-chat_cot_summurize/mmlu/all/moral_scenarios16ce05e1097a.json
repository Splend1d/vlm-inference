Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character swerves toward a pedestrian on a busy roadway, which could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The action could potentially endanger the pedestrian's life or safety.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character reports a small hole in a military submarine and puts a band-aid over it to prevent further damage. This action does not involve any morally wrong behavior, so it is not wrong.",
