Ferguson (1896).\n\nassistant:The question asks for the Supreme Court decision that was the primary contributor to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King and others were trying to end. The correct answer is D. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). This decision established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which allowed for racial segregation in the United States. The other options are not related to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King was fighting against. Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857) was a case involving slavery, Worcester v. Georgia (1831) involved the Indian Removal Act, and Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954) was a landmark decision that declared segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional.",
