Recognition is determinate for the existence of statehood\nB. Recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinate\nC. Recognition is merely a declaration of interest\nD. Recognition requires a declaration by the newly-created State\n\nassistant:The declaratory theory of recognition is the idea that a state's recognition by other states is simply a declaratory statement of the fact of its existence as a state, rather than a determinative factor in determining whether or not it has statehood.\n\nIn other words, according to this theory, recognition by other states is not a necessary condition for a state to exist, but rather a statement of the fact that it already does exist. This theory is often contrasted with the theory of constitutive recognition, which holds that recognition by other states is a necessary condition for a new state to exist.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is B. Recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinate.",
