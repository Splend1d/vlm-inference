Plastic\nB. Automobiles\nC. Computers\nD. Air\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each option and compare the total utility and marginal utility of each.\n\nA. Plastic - Plastic is a versatile and widely used material for various products. However, it is not a product that people typically use in large quantities. Therefore, the total utility of plastic might be relatively small, but the marginal utility would also be relatively small since it is not a product that people consume in large amounts.\n\nB. Automobiles - Automobiles are a product that people usually consume in large quantities. They provide a high level of utility, especially for daily transportation needs. However, once an automobile has been purchased, the marginal utility of each additional unit decreases rapidly due to diminishing marginal returns.\n\nC. Computers - Computers are a product that many people use daily for work, entertainment, or education. They provide a high level of utility, especially for tasks that require information processing and communication. However, the marginal utility of each additional computer decreases over time as people become more familiar with the technology and rely on other means of communication and information processing.\n\nD. Air - Air is a necessary component for life on Earth, providing oxygen and other essential elements. However, it is not a good that people typically consume in large quantities. Therefore, the total utility of air might be relatively small, but the marginal utility would also be relatively small since it is not a product that people consume in large amounts.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that option B. Automobiles is the most likely to provide both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility. This is because automobiles are a product that people typically consume in large quantities and provide a high level of utility, while the marginal utility of each additional unit decreases rapidly due to diminishing marginal returns.",
