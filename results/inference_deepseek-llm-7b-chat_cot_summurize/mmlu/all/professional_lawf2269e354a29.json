In presenting his case-in-chief, the investor sought to introduce an issue of a newspaper to show the corporation's stock price on that given day. Upon objection by the corporation's attorney, this evidence should be\n\nA. admitted, under the business records exception.\nB. admitted, under the market reports exception.\nC. excluded, because the newspaper copy does not fit within any established exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. excluded, because it violates the best evidence rule.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Excluded, because the newspaper copy does not fit within any established exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nIn this case, the investor is trying to introduce a newspaper article as evidence to show the corporation's stock price on a specific day. Hearsay is a statement that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the newspaper article is being offered as evidence to prove the stock price, which is the matter asserted.\n\nThere are several exceptions to the hearsay rule, but none of them apply in this situation. The business records exception allows for the admission of records that were kept in the regular course of business. However, the newspaper article is not a record kept in the regular course of business, but rather a single, single-use document. The market reports exception allows for the admission of market reports that were made for the purpose of providing information in the ordinary course of an enterprise regularly engaged in buying or selling securities. Again, the newspaper article is not a market report, but rather a single article.\n\nTherefore, the newspaper article is not admissible as evidence under any established exception to the hearsay rule, and should be excluded from the trial.",
