It is difficult in such studies to determine whether the observed toxic effects were caused by the substance\nD. It is the only way to ensure results are applicable to people\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nA. Animals are generally much less sensitive than people\n- This statement might be partially true, as animals may not be as sensitive to certain substances as humans, but it is not the only reason.\n\nB. Such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used\n- This statement is true. Since only a small number of animals can be used in toxicity studies, the doses of substances used need to be much higher to ensure that the risks are detected.\n\nC. It is difficult in such studies to determine whether the observed toxic effects were caused by the substance\n- This statement is also true. Toxicity studies are designed to test the potential harm of substances, but it can be difficult to determine the cause of observed effects, especially when multiple substances are involved.\n\nD. It is the only way to ensure results are applicable to people\n- This statement is not entirely true. While it's true that animal studies can provide some insights into human toxicity, they are not the only way to determine the safety of substances for people. Other methods, such as in vitro studies and computational models, can also contribute to this understanding.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer is option B: Such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used.",
