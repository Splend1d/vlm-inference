This organism is most probably a\n\nA. ectotherm.\nB. endotherm.\nC. thermophyle.\nD. ascospore.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. ectotherm.\n\nExplanation: An ectotherm is an organism that relies on external heat sources, such as the sun or the temperature of its environment, to regulate its body temperature. Since they are not able to maintain a consistent internal temperature, they do not experience significant changes in metabolic rate when exposed to wild temperature fluctuations. This is in contrast to endothermic organisms, which can maintain a stable internal temperature and therefore have a more consistent metabolic rate.",
