Therefore, this option is not likely to show mitotic cell divisions.\n\nB. cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower) - An anther is made up of pollen-producing cells, which are non-motile and do not undergo mitosis. This option is not likely to show mitotic cell divisions.\n\nC. longitudinal section of a shoot tip - Shoot tips are actively growing regions of plants, and they undergo cell division through the process of apical meristem cell division. This process involves mitosis, so this option is likely to show mitotic cell divisions.\n\nD. cross section of a leaf - Leaves are made up of specialized cells that perform various functions, but they do not undergo mitosis. This option is not likely to show mitotic cell divisions.\n\nBased on my analysis, the answer is:\n\nC. longitudinal section of a shoot tip",
