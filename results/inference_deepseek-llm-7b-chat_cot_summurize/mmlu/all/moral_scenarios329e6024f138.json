This action is morally questionable but not necessarily wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character puts an alive man in a coffin and nails it shut. This action clearly violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 and is morally wrong.",
