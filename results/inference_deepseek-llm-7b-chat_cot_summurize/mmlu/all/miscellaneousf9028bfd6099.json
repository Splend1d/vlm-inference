The people all saw her come because it was sundown. The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. The description of the sun in the second sentence contains which of the following literary devices?\n\nA. Foreshadowing\nB. Irony\nC. Flashback\nD. Personification\n\nassistant:The passage from Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God contains a description of the sun that can be interpreted as a metaphor for the human condition, specifically the awakening and empowerment of marginalized individuals. The sun, in this case, is described as leaving \"his footprints in the sky,\" implying that it has been present throughout the day, illuminating and guiding the people. The sun's departure is therefore a metaphor for the end of a long day or the beginning of a new period in which the people can finally take control and express themselves. This use of personification to describe the sun as a \"he\" also adds to the metaphor, as it suggests that the sun has a masculine presence and might even be seen as a father figure or authority figure.\n\nThe literary device employed in the passage is personification. Personification is the attribution of human qualities, emotions, or abilities to non-human entities such as objects, animals, or abstract concepts. In this case, the sun is given human qualities and characteristics, such as footprints, to emphasize its significance and impact on the people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Personification",
