Value-oriented approach.\n\nExplanation:\nThe value-oriented approach is when a company sets prices based on how much customers are willing to pay for a product or service. This approach takes into consideration the perceived value of the product or service to the customer, rather than focusing solely on the costs associated with producing and delivering it. This approach is also known as price skimming, where a company sets a high initial price for a new product, and then adjusts the price as competitors enter the market or demand decreases.",
