If Tara can develop 2 rolls of film in 18 minutes, then in 1 minute she can develop 2/18 = 1/9 of a roll of film. Now, let's find out how long it will take her to develop 8 rolls of film:\n\n1 minute / (1/9) = 9 minutes\n\nSo, it will take Tara 9 minutes to develop 8 rolls of film. The closest answer to this is 1 hour 36 minutes (9 minutes * 12), which is option C.",
