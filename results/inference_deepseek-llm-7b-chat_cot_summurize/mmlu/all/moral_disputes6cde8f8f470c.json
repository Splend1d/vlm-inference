This is because option A aligns with the statement that the policy would wipe out several animal species, which would negatively affect the environment. Option B refers to the integrity of the ecosystem, which is indirectly affected by the policy but not directly. Option C is not relevant to the statement, as it suggests that the environment should not exist, which is not the case. Option D contradicts the statement, as the policy is known to negatively affect animal species.",
