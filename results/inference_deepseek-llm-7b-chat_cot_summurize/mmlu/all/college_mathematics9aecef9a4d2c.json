(S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10.\nThis means that if we add two elements from S, the result is also an element of S.\nWe can verify this by adding the elements of S:\n0 + 2 = 2 \u2208 S\n2 + 2 = 4 \u2208 S\n2 + 4 = 6 \u2208 S\n2 + 6 = 8 \u2208 S\n2 + 8 = 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n4 + 4 = 8 \u2208 S\n4 + 6 = 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n4 + 8 = 12 \u2261 2 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n6 + 6 = 12 \u2208 S\n6 + 4 = 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n6 + 8 = 14 \u2261 2 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n8 + 8 = 16 \u2261 4 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n8 + 6 = 14 \u2261 2 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2261 2 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n8 + 6 = 14 \u2261 2 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n8 + 8 = 16 \u2261 4 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n\nSince all the results are elements of S, we can conclude that (S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10.\n\nB. (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\nThis means that if we multiply two elements from S, the result is also an element of S.\nWe can verify this by multiplying the elements of S:\n0 \u00d7 0 = 0 \u2208 S\n0 \u00d7 2 = 0 \u2208 S\n0 \u00d7 4 = 0 \u2208 S\n0 \u00d7 6 = 0 \u2208 S\n0 \u00d7 8 = 0 \u2208 S\n2 \u00d7 2 = 4 \u2208 S\n2 \u00d7 4 = 8 \u2208 S\n2 \u00d7 6 = 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n2 \u00d7 8 = 16 \u2261 4 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n4 \u00d7 4 = 16 \u2261 4 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n4 \u00d7 6 = 20 \u2261 0 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n4 \u00d7 8 = 32 \u2261 6 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n6 \u00d7 6 = 36 \u2261 6 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n6 \u00d7 8 = 48 \u2261 8 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n8 \u00d7 8 = 64 \u2261 1 (mod 10) \u2208 S\n\nSince all the results are elements of S, we can conclude that (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nC. (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\nThe identity element for the operation of addition in a ring is an element that, when added to any other element of the ring, yields that other element.\nThe elements 0 and 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10) are the identity elements for the operation of addition in Z_{10} because:\n0 + 0 = 0\n0 + 1 = 1\n0 + 2 = 2\n...\n0 + 8 = 8\n0 + 9 = 9\n0 + 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10)\n1 + 0 = 1\n1 + 1 = 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10)\n1 + 2 = 3\n1 + 3 = 4\n...\n1 + 8 = 9\n1 + 9 = 10 \u2261 0 (mod 10)\n1 + 10 \u2261 1 (mod 10)\n...\n8 + 0 = 8\n8 + 1 = 9\n8 + 2 = 10 \u2261 0 (mod ",
