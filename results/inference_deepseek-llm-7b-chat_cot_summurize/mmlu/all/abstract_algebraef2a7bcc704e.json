No.\n\nassistant:To determine whether the polynomial 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q, we need to check if the polynomial satisfies the conditions for Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion.\n\nEisenstein's irreducibility criterion states that a polynomial ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d (where a \u2260 0) is irreducible over the field Q if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. a \u2261 1 or -1 (mod p) for some prime number p.\n2. b \u2261 0 (mod p).\n3. c \u2261 0 (mod p^2).\n\nLet's apply Eisenstein's criterion to the given polynomial:\n\n1. a = 8 \u2261 1 (mod 2), since 8 - 1 = 7 \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n2. b = 6 \u2261 0 (mod 2), since 6 - 0 = 6 \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n3. c = -9 \u2261 0 (mod 2), since -9 - 0 = -9 \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n4. d = 24 \u2261 0 (mod 2), since 24 - 0 = 24 \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied for p = 2, the polynomial 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Yes, with p=2.",
