This is because it represents the range of scores within a population, with the lower percentile representing the lowest 20% of scores and the higher percentile representing the highest 20% of scores.\n\n variability.\n\nThis measure does not provide information about central tendency (mean), symmetry (equal spread of scores around the mean), or skewness (one side of the distribution being heavier than the other).",
