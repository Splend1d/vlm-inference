The statute states that an assault is an unlawful attempt, with or without present ability, to commit a battery on the person of another. The defendant's actions were not an attempt to commit a battery on the senior partner, but rather a harmless prank intended to scare him. Furthermore, the senior partner was not frightened by the defendant's actions, which is a requirement for the defendant's actions to constitute an assault under the statute.\n\nTherefore, if the jury believes the defendant and finds that his actions were not intended to cause physical injury to the senior partner, they should find him not guilty of the criminal assault charge.",
