One does not need permission to conduct scientific experiments, as long as they do not violate any laws or regulations.\nC. The aunt's experiments were not necessary to protect her property from the electrical storms, as they were interfering with the brother's property.\nD. The brother does own the space above his land, but the court should still enjoin the aunt's experiments because they constitute an unreasonable interference with the space above his land.",
