It effectuated a novation of their original written contract.\nD. It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n\nassistant:The December 1 agreement between the owner and the worker was a modification of their original written contract. This is because the worker agreed to a salary reduction, which changed the terms of the original contract. This does not constitute a novation, as a novation is the complete transfer of rights and obligations from one party to another, which was not the case here. The modification did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract, as the worker's obligation to work for the owner during November and December remained the same. The agreement did not result in a valid reformation of their original written contract, as a reformation would involve correcting an ambiguity or mistake in the original contract, which was not the case here. Therefore, the most accurate statement is B. It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.",
