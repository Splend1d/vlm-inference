Windows 7\nB. Chrome\nC. IOS12\nD. UNIX\n\nassistant:The answer is D. UNIX.\n\nOld operating systems like UNIX and NT-based systems have buffer-overflow attack as a common vulnerability. Buffer overflow attacks exploit the fact that input data can be stored in a buffer, which is a fixed-size block of memory used to temporarily store data. If the input data is larger than the buffer, it can overwrite adjacent data, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.\n\nUNIX is an operating system that was first released in 1971, and has since become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world. NT-based systems, which stands for \"New Technology,\" include Windows NT and its successors, which were first released in 1993. Both UNIX and NT-based systems have been targets of buffer-overflow attacks in the past, as their design makes them susceptible to this type of attack.\n\nIn order to prevent buffer-overflow attacks, it is important to follow security best practices such as input validation, input sanitization, and limiting the size of input data. Additionally, using a more recent operating system with improved security features can help reduce the risk of buffer-overflow attacks.",
