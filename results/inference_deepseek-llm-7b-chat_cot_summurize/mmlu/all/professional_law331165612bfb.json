At his arraignment, the defendant was represented by counsel. He was then released after posting bond. Following his release, the defendant resumed his job as a bartender at a local bar. Three weeks before the defendant's scheduled trial, an informant entered the bar. After a few drinks, the informant began conversing with the defendant, who was on duty at the time.

This is because the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. The defendant was represented by counsel at his arraignment and was released after posting bond, but he was not provided with effective assistance of counsel during the conversation with the informant. The defendant's counsel should have advised him not to speak with the informant or admit to any wrongdoing, as this could have potentially prejudiced his case. Therefore, the admissions made by the defendant during the conversation with the informant should not be allowed to be introduced into evidence at trial.",
