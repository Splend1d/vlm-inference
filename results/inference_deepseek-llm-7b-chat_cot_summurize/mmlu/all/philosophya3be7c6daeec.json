This option suggests that ignorance of virtuous principles is a virtue in itself, which is not supported by Socrates' statement.\n\nB. This option is a subjective interpretation of Socrates' views, and does not directly address the question of why an unexamined life is not worth living.\n\nD. This option confuses the concept of a virtuous life with the concept of following societal norms.
