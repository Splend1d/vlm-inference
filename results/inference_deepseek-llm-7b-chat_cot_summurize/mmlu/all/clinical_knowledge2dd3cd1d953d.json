Carnitine plays a crucial role in the transport of fatty acids across the mitochondrial inner membrane, where they can be oxidized to produce energy in the form of ATP. During this process, carnitine facilitates the movement of fatty acids into the mitochondria, and once inside, they are oxidized for energy production.",
