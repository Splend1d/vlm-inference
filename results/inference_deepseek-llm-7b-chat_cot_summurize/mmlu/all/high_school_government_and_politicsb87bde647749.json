Grant reprieves and pardons\nB. Appoint Supreme Court justices\nC. Negotiate and ratify treaties\nD. Declare war\n\nassistant:The president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons, appoint Supreme Court justices, and negotiate and ratify treaties without congressional approval. However, the president cannot declare war without congressional approval.\n\nTo be more specific, the Constitution grants the president the power to grant reprieves and pardons, except in cases of impeachment. The president also has the power to nominate Supreme Court justices, and the Senate has the power to approve or reject those nominations. When it comes to treaties, the president has the power to negotiate them, but the Senate has the power to ratify them.\n\nRegarding war, the Constitution requires that Congress declare war through a formal resolution. This is because the Constitution recognizes that war is a serious matter that requires the collective wisdom and judgment of both the executive and legislative branches of government. Therefore, the president cannot declare war on their own, and must seek congressional approval before doing so.",
