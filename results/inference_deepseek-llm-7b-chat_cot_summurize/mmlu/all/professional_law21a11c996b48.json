This is because the agreement is a legally binding contract that both parties have agreed to follow. The terms of the agreement, such as the salary, termination, and non-competition provisions, are all enforceable as long as they do not violate any laws or public policy. The $1,500 penalty clause may be unenforceable if it is considered a penalty and not a legitimate consequence of the employee's breach of contract, but this would depend on the specific circumstances of the case. Overall, the agreement would most likely be considered enforceable in all respects.",
