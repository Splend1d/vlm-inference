An increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by a change in body composition during chronic overfeeding.\n\nJustification:\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis is a physiological response to changes in the environment, such as a decrease in calorie intake or an increase in calorie expenditure. It involves the body adjusting its metabolic rate to maintain a stable temperature. Option A is incorrect because it refers to heat loss, not heat gain. Option B is incorrect because it refers to a decrease in non-shivering thermogenesis, which is a specific type of heat production. Option D is incorrect because it refers to a decrease in physical activity, not an increase in metabolic rate. Option C, however, accurately describes adaptive thermogenesis as an increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by changes in body composition during chronic overfeeding.",
