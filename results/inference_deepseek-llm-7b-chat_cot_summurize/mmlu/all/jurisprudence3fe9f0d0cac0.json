That facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be\n\nDworkin endorses Hume's principle, which states that facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be. This means that our moral judgments are not determined by the way things are in the world, but rather by our beliefs about what is right and wrong. This principle is important in legal and ethical debates, as it emphasizes the role of human judgment in determining what is morally right or wrong.",
