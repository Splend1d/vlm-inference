None of these\n\nassistant:Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula:\n\n    K = (1/2)mv^2\n\n2. The original speed of the model car is given by v1.\n3. When the model car speeds up to three times its original speed, its new speed is given by v2 = 3v1.\n4. The new kinetic energy of the model car is given by K2 = (1/2)(3v1)^2 = (1/2)(9v1^2) = 9/2 K1.\n5. The new kinetic energy is three times greater than the original kinetic energy.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. The new kinetic energy is three times greater.",
