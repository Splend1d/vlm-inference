They ask nothing in return.\n\nMay Lee's Senior View suggests that we should respect our elders because they ask nothing in return. This means that elders don't expect anything from us in return for the respect we give them. They are happy to share their wisdom, guidance, and experiences with us without expecting anything in return. It is important to respect our elders as they have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can help us grow and learn.",
