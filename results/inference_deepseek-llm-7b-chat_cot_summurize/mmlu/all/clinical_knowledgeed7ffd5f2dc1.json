The tone is normal or flaccid\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The tone is normal or flaccid.\n\nSpastic paraplegia is a group of inherited neurological disorders that typically affect the legs and cause muscle stiffness, or spasticity. The tone of the muscles in the affected individual's legs may be normal or flaccid, but it is generally stiff or tight. Multiple sclerosis is not typically associated with spastic paraplegia. Proprioception, or the ability to sense the position of body parts relative to each other, is usually preserved in spastic paraplegia. Coordination in the legs may be affected, but this is not a defining feature of the condition.",
