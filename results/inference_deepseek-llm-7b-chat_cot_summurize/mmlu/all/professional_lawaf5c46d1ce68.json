The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.\nC. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\nD. Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n\nassistant:The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for a landlord to refuse to rent to a prospective tenant because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In this case, the woman's advertisement clearly states a preference for a white male tenant. Therefore, option A is true: The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\n\nOption B is false. The woman's motive (to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds) does not absolve her from liability under the Fair Housing Act. Her preference for a white male tenant is still a violation of the Act.\n\nOption C is false. There is a violation of the Fair Housing Act in this case.\n\nOption D is false. The Act does not prohibit a landlord from stating a preference in their advertisement as long as they are not discriminating against certain protected classes. In this case, the woman's preference is based on a general preference for a mix of tenants, which is not a protected class.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.",
