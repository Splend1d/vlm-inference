The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\nD. Neither party recovers anything from the other.\n\nassistant:The appropriate judgment in this case is:\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\n\nAccording to the statute, if the negligence of the person seeking recovery is not as great as the negligence of the person being sought after, then contributory negligence shall not bar recovery. In this case, both drivers were found liable for negligence, and the jury assigned equal amounts of fault (50%) to each driver. Therefore, neither driver's negligence was greater than the other's.\n\nSince the jury found that the truck driver's injuries were worth $10,000 and the car driver's injuries were worth $8,000, the damages should be reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to each driver. Since each driver was found to be 50% at fault, the damages should be reduced by 50%.\n\nTherefore, the truck driver should recover $10,000 \\* 0.5 = $5,000, and the car driver should recover $8,000 \\* 0.5 = $4,000.",
