The option expired in three months and had an exercise price of $9 per share. What was the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment?\n\nA. $50\nB. $100\nC. $200\nD. $900\n\nassistant:To calculate the intrinsic value of the call option, we can use the Black-Scholes model. The model takes into account the following parameters: stock price ($10), exercise price ($9), volatility ($\\sigma$), and time to expiration (3 months or 0.25 years). We can use the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the intrinsic value, which is the maximum profit an option holder can make when they exercise the option.\n\nThe intrinsic value is calculated as follows:\n\nIntrinsic Value = (S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT))\n\nwhere:\nS = stock price ($10)\nX = exercise price ($9)\nr = risk-free interest rate (assumed to be 0.05)\nT = time to expiration (0.25 years)\nN(d1) = cumulative standard normal distribution function value for d1\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (\u03c3^2)/2) * T) / (\u03c3 * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - \u03c3 * sqrt(T)\n\u03c3 = volatility (assumed to be 0.20)\ne = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\nd1 = (ln(10/9) + (0.05 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.25) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.25))\nd1 \u2248 0.3985\n\nd2 = 0.3985 - 0.20 * 0.7153 \u2248 0.1185\n\nNext, we need to find the cumulative standard normal distribution function value for d1:\nN(0.3985) \u2248 0.5557\n\nNow, we can calculate the intrinsic value:\nIntrinsic Value = (10 * 0.5557 - 9 * e^(-0.05 * 0.25)) \u2248 1.36\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment was approximately $1.36. However, since the options were sold, the value is now zero. The correct answer is D. $900.",
