The company will have annual operating expenses of $7,000 on the new machine. Depreciation expense, included in the operating expenses, is $4,000 per year. The expected payback period for the new machine is 5.2 years. What amount did the company pay for the new machine?\n\nA. $145,600\nB. $161,200\nC. $166,400\nD. $182,000\n\nassistant:To find the amount the company paid for the new machine, we need to calculate the initial investment and the salvage value of the machine.\n\nThe annual revenues are $35,000, the operating expenses are $7,000, the depreciation expense is $4,000, and the payback period is 5.2 years.\n\nThe payback period formula is:\nPayback period = Initial investment / Net cash inflow\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to find the initial investment:\nInitial investment = Net cash inflow * (1 / Payback period)\n\nThe net cash inflow for the first year is:\nNet cash inflow = Revenues - Operating expenses - Depreciation expense\nNet cash inflow = $35,000 - $7,000 - $4,000 = $24,000\n\nNow, we can find the initial investment:\nInitial investment = $24,000 * (1 / 5.2) = $44,117.64\n\nTo find the salvage value, we can use the following formula:\nSalvage value = Initial investment - Depreciation expense * Payback period\n\nSalvage value = $44,117.64 - $4,000 * 5.2 = $22,572.96\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total amount the company paid for the new machine:\nTotal amount paid = Initial investment + Salvage value\nTotal amount paid = $44,117.64 + $22,572.96 = $66,690.60\n\nHowever, none of the given options matches the correct answer.
