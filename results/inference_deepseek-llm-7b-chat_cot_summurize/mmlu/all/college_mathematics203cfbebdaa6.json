You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A discrete graph is complete if there is an edge connecting any pair of vertices. How many edges does a complete graph with 10 vertices have?\n\nA. 10\nB. 20\nC. 25\nD. 45\n\nassistant:A complete graph with 10 vertices has 10 choose 2 edges, which is denoted by C(10, 2) or C(10, 2). This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 10 * 9 * 8! / (2 * 8!)\n\nC(10, 2) = 90 / (2 * 8)\n\nC(10, 2) = 90 / 16\n\nC(10, 2) = 5.625\n\nSince edges cannot have a fractional number of edges, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, a complete graph with 10 vertices has 25 edges. The correct answer is C.",
