Since females have two X chromosomes, they need to inherit the gene from both their parents to develop the condition. Therefore, the frequency of affected females will be half the frequency of affected males.\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females will be 0.10 * 0.5 = 0.05, or 5%. The closest answer to this is option B. 0.001.",
