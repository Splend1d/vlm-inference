We discriminate between pleasant and unpleasant tastes in selecting our food, between pleasant and unpleasant sounds in selecting our music, between harmonious and unharmonious colors in decorating our homes, between interesting and uninteresting people in choosing our friends, and so on. We can't live without discriminating.\n\nA. Prejudicial Language\nB. Equivocation\nC. Inconsistency\nD. Straw Man\n\nassistant:The passage describes a variety of examples of discrimination in different aspects of life, and argues that discrimination is necessary for our survival. The user seems to be trying to make a point about the inevitability of discrimination, but the passage ultimately concludes with a question that seems to be a rhetorical one, as it is asking whether discrimination is necessary for our survival.\n\nThis type of argument is known as a \"straw man,\" which is a common logical fallacy. The straw man argument involves misrepresenting an opponent's argument, then attacking that misrepresented argument rather than the actual argument. In this case, the user is not directly arguing against the laws against discrimination, but is instead presenting a hypothetical argument that is different from the actual laws and their validity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
