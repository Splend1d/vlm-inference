Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character informs their granny about the extra sugar in the cake before she can eat a slice. This is morally right because they are taking care of their granny's health by letting her know about the extra sugar.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character breaks open their brother's piggy bank to buy a doll. This is morally wrong because they are stealing from their brother and not respecting his property.",
