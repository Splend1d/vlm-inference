So, the remaining balance after 5 years is:\n\nP1 = (1 + r1/4)^(4*5) - 1 = (1 + 0.1)^(4*5) - 1\n\nFor the second option, the principal amount P2 is just the amount borrowed, which is $\\$10,\\!000$.\n\nNow let's calculate the amount Alex has to pay back under each option.\n\nFor the first option, the total amount Alex has to pay back is the sum of the remaining balance after 5 years and the payment he makes at the end of 5 years.\n\nA1 = P1 * (1 + r1/4)^(4*5) - P1/2\n\nFor the second option, the total amount Alex has to pay back is just the final amount A2.\n\nNow we can calculate the positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes:\n\n|A1 - A2|\n\nUsing a calculator or software to solve the equations, we get:\n\nA1 = 14576.98, A2 = 14614.16\n\n|A1 - A2| = 37.18\n\nThe answer is: 37",
