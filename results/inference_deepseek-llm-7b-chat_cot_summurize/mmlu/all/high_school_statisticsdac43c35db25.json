A high school sent a survey to a randomly selected sample of 75 last year's graduating class.\n2. 27 of those selected did not return the survey.\n\nOption A suggests changing the sample size to 48, which would result in only 28 surveys being used for analysis (75 - 27). This would not accurately represent the original sample size, and the results may not be reliable.\n\nOption B suggests using the surveys that were returned and leaving the sample size at 75 for the analysis. This would give a total of 52 surveys (75 - 27 + 28), which would be a more representative sample.\n\nOption C suggests randomly selecting 27 additional class members and sending the survey to them. However, this is not an ideal solution, as it would not address the issue of the 27 unreturned surveys.\n\nOption D suggests following up with those that did not return the survey to encourage them to respond. While this would increase the number of usable surveys, it is not a guaranteed solution, as some respondents may still not return the survey.\n\nBased on the available options, the best plan of action would be to use the surveys that were returned and leave the sample size at 75 for the analysis (Option B). This would provide a more representative sample for analysis, allowing the researchers to draw reliable conclusions.",
