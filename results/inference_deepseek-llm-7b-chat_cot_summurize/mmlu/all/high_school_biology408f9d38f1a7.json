H2O exchanges with CO2 at equal rates.\n\nUnder normal daytime environmental conditions, stomata allow gases such as H2O and CO2 to exchange between the inside of a plant leaf and the surrounding environment. Since both gases need to exchange, they will have equal rates of diffusion. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",
