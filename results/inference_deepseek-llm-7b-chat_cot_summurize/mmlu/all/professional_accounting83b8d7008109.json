On that date Rune held the following items in its safe: $4000 check payable to Rune postdated January 3 and not included in the December 31 checkbook balance in collection of a sale made in December. $1000 check payable to Rune deposited December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance but returned by the bank on December 30 stamped \"NSF\". The check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9. What amount should Rune report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet?\n\nA. $9,000\nB. $10,000\nC. $13,000\nD. 14000\n\nassistant:To calculate the correct amount to report as cash in Rune's December 31 balance sheet, we need to consider the check payable to Rune postdated January 3 and the check deposited December 15.\n\nFirst, let's consider the check payable to Rune postdated January 3. Since this check is not included in the December 31 checkbook balance, we need to add the check's value ($4000) to the checkbook balance on December 31 ($10000).\n\n10000 (checkbook balance on December 31) + 4000 (check postdated January 3) = 14000\n\nNow, let's consider the check deposited December 15. This check was returned by the bank on December 30 but redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9. Therefore, we should subtract the returned check value ($1000) from the checkbook balance on December 31 ($10000).\n\n10000 (checkbook balance on December 31) - 1000 (returned check) = 9000\n\nFinally, we need to add the check payable to Rune postdated January 3's value ($4000) to the checkbook balance after the returned check ($9000).\n\n9000 (checkbook balance after returned check) + 4000 (check postdated January 3) = 13000\n\nRune should report $13,000 as cash in its December 31 balance sheet.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $13,000.",
