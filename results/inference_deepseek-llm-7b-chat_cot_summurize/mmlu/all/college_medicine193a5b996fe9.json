For events lasting less than 10 minutes, the low carbohydrate intake may not significantly influence exercise performance, as the duration of the activity is relatively short. However, for high-intensity exercises lasting longer than 10 minutes, the low carbohydrate intake may impair exercise performance. This is because the body relies on a combination of glycogen stores and glucose to fuel intense exercise. When carbohydrate intake is low, the body may not have sufficient energy sources to maintain high-intensity exercise, potentially leading to fatigue and reduced performance.\n\nTo optimize exercise performance, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet that provides adequate amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Proper nutrition, hydration, and training are also key factors in achieving optimal exercise performance.",
