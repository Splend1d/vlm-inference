Its value after 10 years is approximately\n\nA. $4,902\nB. $8,902\nC. $7,122\nD. $12,902\n\nassistant:We are given that an investment of $4000 grows at the rate of 320*e^(0.08t) dollars per year after t years. We want to find the value of the investment after 10 years.\n\nWe can rewrite the growth rate as:\n\n320 * e^(0.08t) = e^(0.08t) * 320\n\nNow, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere:\nA = the final amount\nP = the principal investment (initial amount)\nr = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = the number of times that interest is compounded per year\nt = the number of years\n\nIn this case, P = $4000, r = 0.08, n = 1, and t = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = $4000(1 + 0.08/1)^(1*10)\nA = $4000(1 + 0.08)^10\nA = $4000(1.08)^10\nA \u2248 $4902\n\nSo the value of the investment after 10 years is approximately $4902. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $4,902",
