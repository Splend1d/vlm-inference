To do this, we can use the distance formula.\n\nThe distance formula between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is given by:\n\nd = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)\n\nSince the origin is at (0, 0, 0), we can plug in the coordinates of the given point on the plane, which we will call (x, y, z).\n\nWe have:\n\nd = sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (z - 0)^2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n\nWe want to minimize this distance, so we can take the derivative with respect to x, y, and z and set them equal to 0. However, since the given point is on a plane, it must lie in a plane, which means that its coordinates are linear functions of one of the variables. In other words, there is only one independent variable in the plane.\n\nLet's assume that the given point is of the form (ax + by + cz, dx + ey + fz, 0). We can plug this into the distance formula:\n\nd = sqrt((ax + by + cz - 0)^2 + (dx + ey + fz - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2)\n\nd = sqrt(ax^2 + bxy + by^2 + cz^2 + dx^2 + ey^2 + fz^2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nd = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2)\n\nSince we want to minimize this distance, we can take the derivative with respect to a, b, d, e, and f and set them equal to 0.
