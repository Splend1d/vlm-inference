Therefore, there are $13 - 5 = 8$ positive multiples of $13$ in the list.\n\nAdding $5$ to each of these positive multiples gives us $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$. However, we also need to include the positive multiples of $13$ that are less than $5$, which are $5, 17, 31, \\ldots, 87$. There are $6$ of these numbers, so we add $6 \\cdot 5 = 30$ to our total.\n\nFinally, we add $5$ to each of the negative multiples of $13$ that are less than $-5$, which are $-18, -31, -44, \\ldots, -97$. There are $8$ of these numbers, so we add $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$ to our total.\n\nAdding $40$ to our total of $30$ gives us a final answer of $\\boxed{70}$.\n\nA. 30\nB. 31\nC. 60\nD. 45",
