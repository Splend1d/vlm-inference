False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.\n\nThis statement is true. If H and K are subgroups of G and one of them is normal, then the product HK is also a subgroup of G. This is because the product of two subgroups of a group is always a subgroup of the group.\n\nStatement 2: All groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian.\n\nThis statement is false. There are non-Abelian groups of order p^2 for any prime number p. One such example is the dihedral group D_4 of order 16, which has order p^2 where p = 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
