You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The position of an object is given by the equations x = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25, where x is in meters and t is in seconds. What is the acceleration of the object at t = 1.50 s?\n\nA. 6 m/s^2\nB. 12 m/s^2\nC. 18 m/s^2\nD. 24 m/s^2\n\nassistant:To find the acceleration of the object, we need to find the second derivative of the position function. The first derivative represents the velocity, and the second derivative represents the acceleration.\n\nLet f(t) = x(t) = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25\n\nFirst, find the first derivative, which represents the velocity:\n\nf'(t) = d/dt (2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25)\nf'(t) = 6t^2 + 4.0\n\nNow, find the second derivative, which represents the acceleration:\n\nf''(t) = d/dt (6t^2 + 4.0)\nf''(t) = 12t\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration at t = 1.50 s. Substitute t = 1.50 into the second derivative function:\n\nf''(1.50) = 12(1.50)\nf''(1.50) = 18\n\nThe acceleration of the object at t = 1.50 s is 18 m/s^2, which corresponds to option C.",
