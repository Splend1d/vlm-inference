Ancient Egyptians were more patriarchal in their gender relations than ancient Sumerians.\nD. Ancient Egyptians suffered under a more rigid social hierarchy than ancient Sumerians.\n\nassistant:The question presents two texts from ancient Sumeria and Egypt, and asks us to find the conclusion that the texts best support. The texts discuss the importance of truth and obedience, and the consequences of transgressing these values.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The texts do not provide information about the afterlife, so we cannot compare the view of the afterlife between ancient Egyptians and Sumerians.\n\nB. Both texts emphasize the importance of obeying the gods and their ordinances. The ancient Egyptians may have been more inclined to view political obedience as morally proper because they mention \"those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life,\" which could be interpreted as obedience to the gods' will.\n\nC. The texts do not provide information about gender relations, so we cannot compare the patriarchal tendencies between ancient Egyptians and Sumerians.\n\nD. The texts do not provide information about the social hierarchy, so we cannot compare the rigidity of the social hierarchy between ancient Egyptians and Sumerians.\n\nBased on the analysis, the texts best support the conclusion that ancient Egyptians were more inclined than ancient Sumerians to view political obedience as morally proper.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
