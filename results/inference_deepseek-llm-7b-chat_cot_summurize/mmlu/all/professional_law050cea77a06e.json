However, due to the supplier's inability to provide the burglar alarms, the alarm company had to pay an additional $10,000 for a different supplier. This $10,000 increase is an unanticipated change of circumstances, which means that the original contract price of $100,000 is no longer valid. Therefore, the alarm company could probably recover $110,000 in the action against the builder for services rendered.",
