The market supply curve is the sum of all individual firm supply curves. Therefore, if you aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally, you will obtain the market supply curve.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- A. Aggregate the firm marginal revenue curves horizontally: The firm marginal revenue curve represents the marginal cost of producing one more unit of the good, not the supply curve.\n- B. Aggregate the firm supply curves vertically: This would result in a single firm supply curve, not the market supply curve.\n- C. Aggregate the firm marginal cost curves vertically: The firm marginal cost curve represents the cost of producing one more unit of the good, not the supply curve.",
