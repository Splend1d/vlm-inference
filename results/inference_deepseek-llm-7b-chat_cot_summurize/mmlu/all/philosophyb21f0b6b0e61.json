The philosophical method involves examining fundamental concepts and beliefs, and using logic and reason to evaluate them. This is in contrast to the argumentative method, which is more focused on the use of persuasion and rhetoric, and the propositional logic, which is a branch of logic that deals with the structure and validity of sentences. Syllogistic reasoning is a type of logical reasoning that involves using premises to draw conclusions, but it is not the same as the philosophical method.",
