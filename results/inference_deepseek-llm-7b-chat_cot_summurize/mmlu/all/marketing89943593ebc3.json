Question marks.\nB. Quick winners.\nC. Charging bulls.\nD. Cash outs.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Question marks.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group's portfolio performance framework classifies Strategic Business Units (SBUs) into four categories:\n\n1. Question marks: These are SBUs that have high growth potential but also carry high risks. They are expected to contribute significantly to the company's future performance, but may require significant investments to maintain or increase their market share.\n2. Quick wins: These are SBUs that have a high market share and are expected to achieve significant growth in the short term. They are relatively low-risk, as they are already established in the market.\n3. Cash cows: These are SBUs that have a low growth potential and a high market share. They generate significant profits for the company and are expected to maintain their market position for the foreseeable future.\n4. Stars: These are SBUs that have a high growth potential but are also relatively high-risk. They require significant investments to maintain or increase their market share, but have the potential to generate significant profits for the company in the long term.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nB. Quick winners: This term is not used in the BCG portfolio performance framework.\nC. Charging bulls: This term is not used in the BCG portfolio performance framework.\nD. Cash outs: This term is not used in the BCG portfolio performance framework.",
