A government subsidy.\nB. A government tax.\nC. A higher price.\nD. A lower level of output.\n\nassistant:B. A government tax.\n\nA positive externality occurs when a firm's production or consumption has an unintentional positive impact on others, such as reducing pollution or increasing public safety. A government tax can be used to correct this externality by shifting the cost of the positive impact from the public to the firm responsible for causing it. This can encourage the firm to reduce its production or consumption of the positive externality, ultimately reducing the impact on the public.\n\nA government subsidy would not correct a positive externality, as it would actually encourage the firm to produce or consume more of the positive externality. A higher price may or may not correct the externality, depending on the market structure and the ability of the firm to pass the increased cost onto consumers. A lower level of output would only correct the positive externality if the firm voluntarily reduces its production or consumption of the positive externality, which is not guaranteed.",
