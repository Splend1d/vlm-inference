What is the sum of the coordinates of that point?\n\nA. 12\nB. 36\nC. 39\nD. 13\n\nassistant:We know that $(3,6)$ is on the graph of $y=g(x)$. To find the point on the graph of $y=h(x)$ that has the same y-coordinate as $(3,6)$, we substitute $x=3$ into $h(x)=(g(x))^2$ to find $h(3)=(g(3))^2$. Since $(3,6)$ is on the graph of $y=g(x)$, we know that $g(3)=6$, so $h(3)=(g(3))^2=6^2=36$. Therefore, the point $(3,36)$ is on the graph of $y=h(x)$, and the sum of its coordinates is $3+36=\\boxed{39}$.\nThe answer is: 39",
