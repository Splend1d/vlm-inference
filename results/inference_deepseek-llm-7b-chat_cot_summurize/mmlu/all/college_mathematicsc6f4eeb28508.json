Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. The system is consistent.\n\nTo determine consistency, we can check if the sum of all the coefficients is zero:\n(1 + 3 + 2 + 2) + (1 + 4 + 10 + 2) = 1 + 15 + 14 = 30 = 0\n\nSo, the system is consistent. This statement is true.\n\nB. The system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo check if the system has infinitely many solutions, we can use the Cramer's rule or the Gaussian elimination method. We can observe that the second and third equations are multiples of the first equation. So, the system has infinitely many solutions. This statement is true.\n\nC. The sum of any two solutions is a solution.\n\nLet's assume that the sum of two solutions is a solution. Then, we can express one of the solutions as a linear combination of the other two solutions:\nLet x = a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3\nLet y = b1y1 + b2y2 + b3y3\nLet z = c1z1 + c2z2 + c3z3\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:\n(a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3) + 3(b1y1 + b2y2 + b3y3) + 2(c1z1 + c2z2 + c3z3) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nw + 3x + 2y + 2z = 0\n\nComparing this equation with the first equation, we can see that they are the same. This means that the sum of two solutions is also a solution. This statement is true.\n\nD. Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\nLet's assume that every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). Then, we can express the solutions as a linear combination of (-5, 1, 1, 0):\nLet w = -5k\nLet x = 1k + 1\nLet y = 1k + 1\nLet z = 0\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:\n(-5k) + 3(1k + 1) + 2(1k + 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n-5k + 3k + 3 + 2k + 2 = 0\n-2k + 7 = 0\n-2k = -7\nk = 7/2\n\nSubstituting k back into the expressions for x, y, and z, we get:\nx = 7/2 + 1\ny = 7/2 + 1\nz = 0\n\nHowever, we can see that the solution (7/2 + 1, 7/2 + 1, 0) does not satisfy the second equation:\n(7/2 + 1) + 4(7/2 + 1) + y = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n7/2 + 1 + 28/2 + 4 + y = 0\n31/2 + 5 + y = 0\ny = -36/2\ny = -18\n\nSo, the solution (7/2 + 1, 7/2 + 1, -18, 0) does not satisfy the second equation. Therefore, the statement \"Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0)\" is false.",
