Which of the following best describes the range of tvalues that would have given this P-value?\n\nA. 1.345 < t< 1.761\nB. 1.356 < t< 1.782\nC. 1.771 < t< 2.160\nD. 1.350 < t< 1.771\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. 1.350 < t< 1.771.\n\nTo understand why, we need to know a bit about statistical tests and P-values. A P-value is the probability that, given the null hypothesis is true, the observed data or more extreme would have occurred. In other words, it's a measure of how likely it is that the sample came from the population under the null hypothesis.\n\nIn this case, we have a P-value of 0.075. This means that, given the null hypothesis is true, there is a 7.5% chance of observing the data or more extreme. This is a relatively small P-value, indicating that the data is unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.\n\nTo determine the range of t-values that would have given this P-value, we can look at the t-distribution. The t-distribution is a way of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the mean under the null hypothesis. The t-statistic is a measure of how far the sample mean is from the hypothesized population mean, and the t-value is the t-statistic divided by the standard error of the mean.\n\nThe standard error of the mean is a measure of the uncertainty in the sample mean. The smaller the standard error, the more certain we can be that the sample mean is close to the true population mean. In this case, we want to find the range of t-values that would have resulted in a P-value of 0.075.\n\nTo do this, we can look at the t-distribution table or use a calculator or software to find the t-value for a P-value of 0.075. The t-value for a P-value of 0.075 is approximately 1.771.\n\nTherefore, the range of t-values that would have given a P-value of 0.075 is 1.771 < t < 2.160, which corresponds to answer choice D.",
