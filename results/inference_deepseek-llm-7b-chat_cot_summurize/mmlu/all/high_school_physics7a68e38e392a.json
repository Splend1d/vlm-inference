It feels no forces other than gravity and the force from the surface. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the surface is \u03bc, how far does the box slide before coming to rest?\n\nA. v0^2/(2\u03bcg)\nB. v0^2/(\u03bcg)\nC. 2v0^2/(\u03bcg)\nD. mv0^2/(\u03bcg)\n\nassistant:To determine how far the box slides before coming to rest, we need to find the total mechanical energy of the system. The initial mechanical energy of the box is its initial kinetic energy, KE\u2080 = 0.5mv\u2080^2. Since there are no external forces acting on the box, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved.\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy of the box and the gravitational potential energy of the box. The gravitational potential energy of the box is given by U\u2093 = mgy, where y is the vertical displacement of the box.\n\nWhen the box comes to rest, its velocity in the x-direction is zero, and its velocity in the vertical direction is also zero. This means that the box is at its highest point when it comes to rest. Therefore, the vertical displacement y of the box is equal to its initial height above the surface, which is mgh\u2080.\n\nNow we can calculate the total mechanical energy of the system:\n\nKE\u2080 + U\u2093 = mgh\u2080 + 0.5mv\u2080^2\n0.5mv\u2080^2 + mgh\u2080 = mgh\u2080\n0.5mv\u2080^2 = 0\n\nThis equation is not true, so the total mechanical energy of the system is not conserved.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options is correct.",
