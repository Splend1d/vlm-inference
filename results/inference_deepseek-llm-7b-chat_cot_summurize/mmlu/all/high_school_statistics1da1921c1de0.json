We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\nD.

We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\n\nThe correct answer is C, which explains that we use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means. This is because the Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions and not means. The proportion of a sample is approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the true proportion in the population and a standard deviation equal to the standard error, which is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nOn the other hand, the mean of a sample is not normally distributed. Instead, it is distributed according to the sampling distribution, which is called the sampling distribution of the mean. This distribution is not normally distributed, and its shape depends on the variability of the population. The standard error of the mean is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Central Limit Theorem does apply to means as well as proportions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions, not means.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it is not related to the use of z for inference procedures for means.",
