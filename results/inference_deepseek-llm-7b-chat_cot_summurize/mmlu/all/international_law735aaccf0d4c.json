The UN Human Rights Council scrutinises the human rights records of member states on the Council and each member state of the UN.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council is an intergovernmental body that was established in 2006 to promote and protect human rights around the world. It is made up of 47 member states, which are elected by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The Council's primary function is to review and consider the human rights situations of all UN member states, as well as to investigate and address specific human rights violations. The Council does not have the power to impose economic sanctions on a state for human rights violations, as that power lies with the Security Council. The Council also does not replace the Economic and Social Committee, which is another UN intergovernmental body that deals with economic and social issues.",
