Which of the following will be true?\n\nA. An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.\nB. The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of \u2013Q.\nC. The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\nD. The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nA. An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.\nWhen the charged nonconducting sphere is brought close to the conducting sphere, an electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere due to the presence of the electric charge.\n\nB. The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of \u2013Q.\nNo, the conducting sphere will not develop a net electric charge. It is a neutral sphere, meaning it has no net charge.\n\nC. The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\nYes, the spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction. The positive charge on the nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charge on the electrons in the conducting sphere, causing a repulsive force between the two spheres.\n\nD. The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.\nNo, the spheres will not experience an electrostatic repulsion. As mentioned in option C, the positive charge on the nonconducting sphere will attract the negative charge on the electrons in the conducting sphere, causing a repulsive force.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.",
