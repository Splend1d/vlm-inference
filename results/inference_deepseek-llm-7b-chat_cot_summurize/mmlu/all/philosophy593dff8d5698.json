David Hume, a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, defined reason as a cool and disengaged aspect of our mental faculties. He argued that reason should not be the primary source of moral actions, but rather, emotions and passions should play a more significant role in motivating people to act morally. In this sense, Hume's view of reason is not as a first spring or impulse to desire, but rather as a tool for examining and evaluating our desires and passions.",
