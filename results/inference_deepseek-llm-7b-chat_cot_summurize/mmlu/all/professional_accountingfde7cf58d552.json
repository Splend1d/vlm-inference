What is the company\u2019s times-interest-earned ratio?\n\nA. 5.4\nB. 6.4\nC. 7.4\nD. 10\n\nassistant:To calculate the times-interest-earned ratio, we need to subtract the interest expense from the company's operating income (before taxes and depreciation) and then divide the result by the interest expense.\n\nOperating income = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses - Depreciation\n\nLet's assume the company's revenue is $10 million, cost of goods sold (COGS) is $2 million, operating expenses are $2 million, and depreciation is $1 million.\n\nOperating income = $10 million - $2 million - $2 million - $1 million = $5 million\n\nNow, let's calculate the company's pre-tax income:\n\nPre-tax income = Operating income - Depreciation expense\nPre-tax income = $5 million - $1 million = $4 million\n\nNext, let's calculate the company's after-tax income:\n\nAfter-tax income = Pre-tax income x (1 - tax rate)\nAfter-tax income = $4 million x (1 - 40%) = $4 million x (1 - 0.4) = $4 million x 0.6 = $2.4 million\n\nFinally, let's calculate the company's times-interest-earned ratio:\n\nTimes-interest-earned ratio = After-tax income / Interest expense\nTimes-interest-earned ratio = $2.4 million / $1 million = 2.4\n\nThe closest answer to the calculated ratio is option D, which is 10.",
