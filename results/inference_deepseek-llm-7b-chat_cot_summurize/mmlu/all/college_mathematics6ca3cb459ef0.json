To determine the type of graph, we can rewrite the equation using exponents properties:\n\nx^(log_y y) = y^(log_x x)\n\nNow, we can see that the graph is the intersection of two lines, one with slope log_x x and the other with slope log_y y. To visualize this, we can think of the graph as a \"diamond\" shape, with the top and bottom edges being the lines y^(log_x x) and x^(log_y y), respectively. The left and right edges of the diamond are the x-intercepts of the two lines.\n\nThe graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis, so it is symmetric with respect to the first quadrant. Therefore, the graph is an open first quadrant.\n\nThe answer is A.",
