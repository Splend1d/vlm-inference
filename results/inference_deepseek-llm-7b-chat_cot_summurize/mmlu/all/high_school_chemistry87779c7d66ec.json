The sample initially occupied a volume of 5.00 L at 127\u00b0C and 875 mm Hg. The sample was heated, at constant pressure, until it occupied a volume of 10.00 L.\n\nA. 454\u00b0C\nB. 527\u00b0C\nC. 45\u00b0C\nD. 181\u00b0C\n\nassistant:To determine the final temperature of the helium gas, we can use the formula:\n\nfinal\\_temperature = (final\\_volume \\* pressure) / (initial\\_volume \\* initial\\_pressure)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial pressure to mm Hg. We know that 1 atm = 760 mm Hg. Therefore, initial pressure is 875 / 760 = 1.14 atm.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nfinal\\_temperature = (10.00 L \\* 1.14 atm) / (5.00 L \\* 1.27\u00b0C)\n\nfinal\\_temperature = (11.4\u00b0C) / (6.43\u00b0C)\n\nfinal\\_temperature = 1.79\n\nThe closest option to 1.79 is D. 181\u00b0C.",
