The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party.

Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\n\nA joint tenancy, as described in the warranty deed, means that each of the three sisters owns an equal and undivided interest in the property. When one sister conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party, this was invalid because each sister already owned an equal and undivided interest in the property. The third party's subsequent conveyance by will to her son also does not change the ownership structure of the property, as the son would still only own a one-third interest.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because a will can indeed create a joint tenancy. The deed of warranty merely requires the language \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship\" to create a joint tenancy.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the conveyance of a one-third interest by the sister to the third party severed the joint tenancy, and the third party's son would now own a one-third interest in the property, not the whole property.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the sister did not need to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy. The conveyance of a one-third interest to a third party, as described in the warranty deed, would have already severed the joint tenancy.",
