If a section of the template strand had a ration of 3:2 of A:T bases, what is the ration of A:T in the newly synthesized complimentary strand of DNA?\n\nA. 3:02\nB. 1:01\nC. 2:03\nD. cannot be determined\n\nassistant:The ratio of A:T in the original double-stranded DNA is 3:2. When a section of the template strand is removed, the ratio of A:T in the template strand becomes 3:1. Since DNA polymerase adds complimentary nucleotides in a 3:1 ratio to the template strand, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complimentary strand of DNA will be 2:1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 2:03.",
