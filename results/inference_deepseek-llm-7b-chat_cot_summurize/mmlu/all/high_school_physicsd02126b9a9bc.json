Calculate its total flight time, assuming that air resistance is negligible.\n\nA. 0.5 s\nB. 1 s\nC. 2 s\nD. 4 s\n\nassistant:To calculate the total flight time of the soccer ball, we need to consider the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height and then to return to the ground.\n\nLet's break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial horizontal velocity of the soccer ball, which is 0 m/s (since it is at rest).\n2. Calculate the initial vertical velocity of the soccer ball. Since the launch angle is 30\u00b0, we can use the following formula:\n\ninitial_vertical_velocity = initial_horizontal_velocity * sin(30\u00b0)\ninitial_vertical_velocity = 0 * sin(30\u00b0)\ninitial_vertical_velocity = 0 m/s\n\n3. Calculate the maximum height the ball reaches. We can use the following formula:\n\nmax_height = initial_vertical_velocity * time_to_max_height\nmax_height = 0 * time_to_max_height\nmax_height = 0 m\n\nSince the maximum height is 0 m, the ball never reaches its maximum height and will return to the ground immediately after being kicked. Therefore, the total flight time is 0 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 0.5 s.",
