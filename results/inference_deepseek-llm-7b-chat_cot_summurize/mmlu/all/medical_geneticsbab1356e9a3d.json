Parental consanguinity\nB. Male to male transmission\nC. Transmission only by females\nD. Transmitted by males only to females\n\nassistant:X-linked dominant inheritance is a type of inheritance where a trait is passed from a parent with the dominant allele to their offspring with a high probability. In this case, the trait is inherited from the father since the X chromosome is inherited only from the father.\n\nOption B, \"Male to male transmission,\" is incorrect because X-linked dominant traits are only passed from fathers to their sons.\n\nOption C, \"Transmission only by females,\" is also incorrect because while X-linked dominant traits are only passed from fathers, they can be passed to both males and females.\n\nOption D, \"Transmitted by males only to females,\" is partially correct. X-linked dominant traits are indeed only passed from fathers to their sons and daughters. However, this option does not mention that the trait can also be passed to males, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B, \"Male to male transmission.\"",
