The owners switch from whole wheat to sourdough bread.\nB. The owners hire several part-time workers to cover the dinner shifts.\nC. The owners work overtime on a busy weekend.\nD. The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating.\n\nassistant:D. The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating.\n\nExplanation: A long-run adjustment for the owners of a small caf\u00e9 would involve changes that would have a lasting impact on the business. Option D involves the owners expanding their space by buying the office next door, which doubles the customer seating. This would likely increase the caf\u00e9's capacity to serve customers and potentially lead to more revenue in the long run.\n\nOption A is a short-term adjustment, as it involves a change in the type of bread the caf\u00e9 serves. Option B is also a short-term adjustment, as it involves hiring part-time workers to cover shifts, which would only be effective in the short term. Option C is an example of a short-term adjustment for the owners, as it involves the owners working overtime during a busy weekend.",
