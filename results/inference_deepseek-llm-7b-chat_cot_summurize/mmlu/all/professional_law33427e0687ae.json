If her mistake was reasonable, then her defense would be valid (option A). If she didn't know that the billing to the bar review company included the symposium expenditure, it would also be a valid defense (option B). However, if the bookkeeping error was unreasonable, then her defense would be invalid (option C). The professor's indictment for false pretenses would be invalid if the white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability (option D), but this is not mentioned in the scenario, so it is not a valid defense. Therefore, based on the information provided, the valid defenses for the professor would be options A and B.",
