This means that over time, the total disorder or randomness in the universe will increase.\n\nOption A is incorrect because heat can flow from hot to cold under certain conditions, but it is not guaranteed to flow in this direction.\n\nOption B is incorrect because heat can flow from cold to hot under certain conditions, but it is not guaranteed to flow in this direction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is not a complete statement of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law states that heat flows from hot to cold without external energy input, not that it always flows from hot to cold.\n\nOption D is correct because it is a complete statement of the second law of thermodynamics, stating that heat flows from hot to cold without external energy input. This is the principle that allows spontaneous processes to occur, such as the expansion of a gas or the melting of ice.",
