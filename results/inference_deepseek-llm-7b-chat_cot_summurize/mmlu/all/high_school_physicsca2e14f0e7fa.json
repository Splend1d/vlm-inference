A few moments later, the wave produced by the rock\u2019s impact arrives at the shore, touching the ankles of a wading child. Which of the following observations provides evidence that the portion of the wave hitting the child\u2019s ankles carries less energy than the wave did when it was first created by the rock\u2019s impact?\n\nA. The wave is moving more slowly.\nB. The wave pulse\u2019s width has become greater.\nC. The wave pulse\u2019s width has become smaller.\nD. The wave\u2019s height has become smaller.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The wave is moving more slowly.\n\nWhen a rock drops onto a pond's smooth surface, it creates a wave that travels across the water. As the wave moves, it loses energy due to various factors such as friction and air resistance. The energy loss causes the wave to slow down, which can be observed in option A.\n\nOption B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not indicate a decrease in energy. The width of the wave pulse (B) does not necessarily reflect the energy, and the width can change due to various factors, such as the size of the pond or the shape of the pond's surface. Similarly, the width of the wave pulse (C) can also change due to these factors and does not provide evidence of the energy loss. The height of the wave (D) also does not indicate energy loss; in fact, it can increase or decrease depending on various factors.",
