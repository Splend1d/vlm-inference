An end to war and the creation of a lasting peace\n\nassistant:The historical transition suggested by the phrase \"negotiations with the Tories\" refers to the change from a divinely-ordained monarch to a constitutionally-approved monarch. In this context, the \"Tories\" likely refers to the Conservative party, which was historically opposed to the idea of a constitutional monarchy. The negotiations mentioned in the excerpt suggest that Queen Victoria was dealing with a period of transition in which her authority as a monarch was being redefined and reaffirmed through constitutional processes and laws. This process was part of a larger movement towards a more democratic and constitutional form of government in the United Kingdom, which was a significant shift from the more autocratic and absolute monarchies of the past. This transition can be seen as an example of how the political and social landscape of the time was evolving, as the monarchy was being redefined and reaffirmed through constitutional processes and laws.",
