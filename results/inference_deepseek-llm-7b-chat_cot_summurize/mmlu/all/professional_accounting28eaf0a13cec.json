The use of tests of controls should be considered without regard to the level of assurance required.\n\nassistant:D. The use of tests of controls should be considered without regard to the level of assurance required.\n\nExplanation: The nature of tests to use in a financial statement audit is primarily determined by the level of assurance required by the audit client, as well as the inherent risks associated with the financial statements. Therefore, tests of controls, which are a type of substantive procedures, should be considered in accordance with the level of assurance needed. While tests of details and analytical procedures are also important aspects of an audit, they should be used in a manner that is consistent with the overall audit strategy and risk assessment.",
