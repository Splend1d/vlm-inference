Product pricing.\nB. Price differentiation.\nC. Pure price bundling.\nD. Odd-Number pricing.\n\nassistant:The concept you are referring to is A. Product pricing.\n\nProduct pricing is a strategy in which a company offers a product or service along with another typically complementary product or service to the customer. This strategy is commonly used in the retail industry, where a product or service is bundled with other complementary items to increase the overall value for the customer and encourage them to purchase more items.\n\nThe goal of product pricing is to create a sense of value for the customer by offering them a package deal that they might not be able to find individually. This strategy can also help the company increase their profits by selling more products or services.\n\nThere are different types of product pricing strategies, such as price differentiation, pure price bundling, and odd-number pricing, but they all involve offering multiple products or services together to the customer.\n\nI hope this information helps!
