It fails to specify the source of authority.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. It fails to specify the source of authority.\n\nExplanation:\nHart argues that secondary rules are 'power-conferring' because they establish the authority of certain individuals or institutions to make decisions and impose duties on others. However, in the case of the rule of recognition, this power-conferring effect is not clear because it does not specify the source of authority. The rule of recognition is a fundamental principle that serves as the foundation for the rest of the legal system, but it does not explicitly state who or what has the authority to make decisions and impose duties. Therefore, this seems unconvincing in the context of secondary rules.\n\nOther answers are incorrect because:\n\nA. The rule of recognition both confers power and imposes duties on judges to decide cases, but it does not specify who or what has the authority to make decisions and impose duties.\n\nB. The rule of recognition is a social rule because it establishes the authority of the legal system as a whole, and it is not a social rule if it only applies to unitary constitutions.\n\nC. The rule of recognition applies to unitary constitutions, but this does not address the issue of the source of authority.",
