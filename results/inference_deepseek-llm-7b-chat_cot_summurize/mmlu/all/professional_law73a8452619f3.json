Privily of estate, but not privily of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation.\nD. Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.\n\nIn this scenario, the property owner has a leasehold agreement with the shopkeeper, which means privity of estate exists between them. The leasehold agreement also contains a clause that the shopkeeper is not permitted to assign the lease to anyone except a corporation with an \"A\" credit rating, which means privity of contract also exists between the property owner and the shopkeeper.\n\nSimilarly, the shopkeeper has a leasehold agreement with the corporation, which means privity of estate exists between them. The leasehold agreement also contains a clause that the corporation agrees to abide by all terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper, which means privity of contract also exists between the shopkeeper and the corporation.\n\nLastly, the corporation leases the premises to the non-profit organization, which means privity of estate exists between them. However, privity of contract does not exist between the property owner and the non-profit organization, as the non-profit organization is not bound by any terms and conditions in the original leasehold agreement between the property owner and the shopkeeper.",
