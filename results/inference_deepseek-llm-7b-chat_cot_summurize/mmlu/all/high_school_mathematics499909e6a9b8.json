Since all sides of a square are equal, the length of each side is the same as the radius of the circle.\n\nThe given information states that the circumference of the circle is $12\\pi$ units. We know that the formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. Therefore, we can set up the equation $12\\pi = 2\\pi r$.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$, we get $12 = 2r$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r = 6$.\n\nSince the length of each side of the square is equal to the radius, which is 6 units, the area of the square is calculated as $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of each side. Therefore, the area of the square is $6^2 = 36$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 36.",
