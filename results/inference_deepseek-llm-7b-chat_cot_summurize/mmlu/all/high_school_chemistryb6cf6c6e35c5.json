In addition, it is a poor conductor of electricity and does not dissolve in water. The substance most likely contains\n\nA. ionic bonding\nB. nonpolar covalent bonding\nC. covalent network bonding\nD. metallic bonding\n\nassistant:The substance most likely contains D. metallic bonding.\n\nMetallic bonding is characterized by the presence of a continuous electron sea that delocalizes throughout the entire crystal lattice of a metal. This delocalized electron sea is responsible for the high melting point, poor conductivity of electricity, and insolubility in water. The other options do not account for these properties.\n\nA. Ionic bonding involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, which does not explain the high melting point or the poor conductivity of electricity.\n\nB. Nonpolar covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms, which does not explain the high melting point or the poor conductivity of electricity.\n\nC. Covalent network bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms in a three-dimensional network, which does not explain the high melting point or the poor conductivity of electricity.",
