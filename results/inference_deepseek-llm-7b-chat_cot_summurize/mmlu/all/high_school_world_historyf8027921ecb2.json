He states that a society must \"exploit the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump\" in order to achieve global hegemony. This fits with the colonization of the Americas by Western Europeans, who used their newfound resources and technology to become more productive and powerful.",
