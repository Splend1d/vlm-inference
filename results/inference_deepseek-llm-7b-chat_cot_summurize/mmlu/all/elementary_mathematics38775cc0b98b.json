At this rate, how many minutes will it take the machine to fill 500 bottles of soda?\n\nA. 25 minutes\nB. 28 minutes\nC. 30 minutes\nD. 40 minutes\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. We know that 200 bottles of soda take 12 minutes to fill, so we can set up the proportion:\n\n200 bottles / 12 minutes = 500 bottles / x minutes\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross multiply:\n\n200 * x = 500 * 12\n\nx = (500 * 12) / 200\n\nx = 3 * 12\n\nx = 36\n\nTherefore, it will take the machine 36 minutes to fill 500 bottles of soda. The correct answer is D. 40 minutes.",
