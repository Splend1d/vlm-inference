Therefore, the auditor should trace transactions from the sales journal to the shipping documents. This is because the sales journal records the amounts of sales, and by tracing the transactions, the auditor can ensure that the amounts recorded in the sales journal match the amounts recorded in the shipping documents. This helps to detect any overstatements of sales that may have occurred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Sales journal to the shipping documents.",
