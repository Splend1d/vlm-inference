Since A \u2228 B is a tautology, it is always true. The premise (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D) is also true, as the implication (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D) is true when the antecedent (A \u2228 B) is true, and the consequent (C \u2228 D) is also true. Therefore, (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D is true, as the antecedent (A \u2228 B) is true, and the implication (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D) is true.\n\nTherefore, the immediate consequence of the given premises in PL is:\n\nD.
