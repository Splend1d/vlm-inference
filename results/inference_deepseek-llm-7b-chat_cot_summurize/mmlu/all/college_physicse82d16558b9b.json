Understand the relationship between temperature and the expansion of the universe.\n2. Consider the difference in temperature between 12 K and 3 K.\n3. Calculate the distance between the objects based on the relationship.\n\nStep 1: Understand the relationship between temperature and the expansion of the universe.\nAs the temperature of the universe increases, the expansion of the universe also increases. The relationship between temperature and the expansion of the universe is such that as the temperature decreases, the distances between objects increase.\n\nStep 2: Consider the difference in temperature between 12 K and 3 K.\nThe temperature difference between 12 K and 3 K is 9 K.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the distance between the objects based on the relationship.\nAs the temperature increases by 9 K, the distance between objects increases by a factor of 1.5. Therefore, when the temperature was 12 K, the typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were separated by about 1.5 times the distance they are today.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Separated by about the same distances as they are today.",
