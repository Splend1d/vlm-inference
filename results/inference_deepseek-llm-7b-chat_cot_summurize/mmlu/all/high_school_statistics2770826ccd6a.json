The standard deviation of all the salaries.\nD. The median of all the salaries.\n\nassistant:The teachers' union would be most likely to quote the mean of all the salaries during negotiations. This is because the mean is often used to represent the average salary, and the union wants to argue that the current salaries are too low. The mode and median are not typically used to represent the average salary, and the standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the salaries are, which may not be relevant to the union's argument.",
