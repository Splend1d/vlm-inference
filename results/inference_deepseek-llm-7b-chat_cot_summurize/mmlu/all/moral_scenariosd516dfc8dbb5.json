This action is considered wrong because it disrupts the game, wastes water, and may cause damage to the field or equipment.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character throws a shovelful of dirt into a wheelbarrow. This action is not considered morally wrong because it does not harm anyone or anything, and it is a relatively harmless action.",
