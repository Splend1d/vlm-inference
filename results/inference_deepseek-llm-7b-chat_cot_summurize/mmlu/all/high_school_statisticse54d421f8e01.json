To find the mean (\u03bc), we can set up the following equation:\n\n12,000 < \u03bc < 14,000\n\nTo find the standard deviation (\u03c3), we can set up the following equation:\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(10,000^2 * (1 - 0.8) + 12,000^2 * 0.8)\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(10,000^2 * 0.2 + 12,000^2 * 0.8)\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a(20,000 + 14,400,000)\n\n\u03c3 = \u221a14,600,000\n\n\u03c3 = 3,468.57\n\nNow, let's find the mean (\u03bc):\n\n\u03bc = 12,000 + (14,000 - 12,000) * 0.8\n\n\u03bc = 12,000 + 2,000 * 0.8\n\n\u03bc = 12,000 + 1,600\n\n\u03bc = 13,600\n\nNow let's calculate the standard deviation (\u03c3):\n\n\u03c3 = 3,468.57\n\nSince the given standard deviation is not in the answer choices, there might be a mistake in the question or in the calculations.",
