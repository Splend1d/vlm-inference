To avoid overfitting the training set\n\nPruning a Decision Tree is a technique used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns. By removing excessive branches or \"prune\" the Decision Tree, we can prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on new data.",
