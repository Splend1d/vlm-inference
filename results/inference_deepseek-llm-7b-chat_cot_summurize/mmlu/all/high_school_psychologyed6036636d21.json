This principle states that when elements in a visual field are close to each other, they are perceived as a group or whole, rather than as separate elements. In the case of the word \"in car nate,\" the letters car are close together, which makes them stand out as a group, while the other letters are not as close together and are therefore perceived as separate elements. Therefore, the answer is D. proximity.",
