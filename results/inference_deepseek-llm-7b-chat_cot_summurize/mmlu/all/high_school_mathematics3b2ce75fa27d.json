What is the area of the square?\n\nA. 20\nB. 34\nC. 40\nD. \\sqrt{40}\n\nassistant:To find the area of a square, you need to know the length of one of its sides. In this case, we know that the opposite vertices of the square are points $(1,2)$ and $(7,4)$. \n\nFirst, let's find the distance between the two points using the distance formula:\n\nDistance between $(1,2)$ and $(7,4)$ = $\\sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = \\sqrt{40}$\n\nNow that we have the length of one side of the square, we can find the area:\n\nArea of the square = Side length \u00d7 Side length = $\\sqrt{40} \u00d7 \u221a40 = 40$\n\nThe correct answer is C. 40.",
