The tract was located in a small town. In 1974, the landowner conveyed the tract to the town development association \"on condition that a ski lodge and resort area be built thereon and the land be used solely for skiing purposes and, in the event that said property is not used as a ski resort, the property shall revert to myself, the grantor, my heirs or assigns. \" Subsequently, a ski lodge was built and the land was continuously used as a ski resort for more than 20 years.

The skier, because the language of the conveyance to the town development association was too vague to support any claim by the wife.\n\nassistant:A. The wife, because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription.\n\nThe correct answer is A. The wife because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription. The town development association has already voted unanimously to grant the easement to the skier, and the easement is consistent with the original condition of the conveyance to the town development association. The negative restriction that the landowner originally sought to impose would not prevent the grant of an easement, as the condition only required the land to be used solely for skiing purposes and would not prevent an easement that is incidental to the use of the land. Therefore, the wife's argument that the easement would violate the negative restriction is not valid. The language of the conveyance to the town development association is clear and unambiguous, and the wife cannot claim that it is too vague to support any claim by the skier.",
