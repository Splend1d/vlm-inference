The equilibrium constant, Kp, at a certain temperature is 3.0 \u00d7 10^22. A 2.0-liter flask has enough SO3 added to it to produce a pressure of 0.789 atm Hg. After the reaction comes to equilibrium, the expected partial pressure of O2 will be\n\nA. 2.88 \u00d7 10^-6 torr\nB. 3 \u00d7 10^-18 mm Hg\nC. 1100 mm Hg\nD. 1.32 \u00d7 10^-5 torr\n\nassistant:To find the expected partial pressure of O2, we can use the following equation:\n\nP_O2 = Kp * P_SO3\n\nwhere P_O2 is the partial pressure of O2, Kp is the equilibrium constant, and P_SO3 is the partial pressure of SO3.\n\nWe are given that P_SO3 = 0.789 atm Hg. We can convert this to torr by multiplying by the conversion factor 760:\n\nP_SO3 = 0.789 atm Hg \\* 760 torr/atm = 634.8 torr\n\nNow we can use the equation to find P_O2:\n\nP_O2 = 3.0 \\* 10^22 \\* 634.8 torr\nP_O2 = 190,444 torr\n\nFinally, we can convert this to mm Hg by multiplying by the conversion factor 0.001:\n\nP_O2 = 190,444 torr \\* 0.001 = 1.904 mm Hg\n\nTherefore, the expected partial pressure of O2 is 1.904 mm Hg. However, none of the answer choices match this value. There may be an error in the problem or the answer choices. Please check the problem again.",
