Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character didn't visit a baby when they were sick, which is not necessarily morally wrong. It's a personal choice and depends on the specific circumstances.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character admits to being the boat captain for rich people who love getting drunk on yachts. Although this behavior might be seen as morally wrong by some people, it doesn't directly involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
