The defendant was to go back to college by himself. The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates.

The state trooper did not have probable cause to stop the defendant's vehicle, and therefore, the search that led to the discovery of the cocaine was unlawful. This means that any evidence found as a result of the illegal search, including the cocaine, cannot be used against the defendant in a trial.\n\nOption A is not a valid defense because the defendant knew that the package contained cocaine. He agreed to deliver it and placed it in his glove compartment.\n\nOption B is not a valid defense because the roommate did not need to tell the defendant that the package contained cocaine in order for the defendant to be guilty of possession. The mere act of possessing the cocaine, regardless of whether the defendant knew it was there or not, is enough to establish guilt.\n\nOption C is not a valid defense because the package did belong to the defendant's roommate, not the defendant himself. The defendant simply agreed to deliver it for his roommate.\n\nTherefore, the best defense for the defendant is that the cocaine was illegally seized.",
