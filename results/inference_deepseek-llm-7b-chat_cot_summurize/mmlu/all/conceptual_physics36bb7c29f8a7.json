All of these\n\nassistant:D. All of these\n\nExplanation:\n\nAll parts of a laser beam do have the same frequency, phase, and speed. This is because a laser beam is a coherent light beam, which means that all the waves within the beam are in phase and have the same frequency. Additionally, all the photons within the beam are moving at the same speed, which is determined by the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second).",
