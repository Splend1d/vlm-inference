In this case, the wife approached the undercover agent with a plan to have her husband killed, offering to pay him $20,000 if he agreed to the job and an additional $20,000 after the murder was completed. This constitutes an attempt to solicit assistance in committing a crime, which is a violation of the law.\n\nThe undercover agent, although feigning agreement, was actually intending not to go through with the plan and was only pretending to accept the wife's proposal. However, this does not change the fact that the wife made an offer to commit a crime, and the defendant's actions in agreeing to the proposal can be considered as an attempt to solicit assistance in the crime.\n\nTherefore, the defendant will most likely be found guilty of solicitation, as they were attempting to solicit assistance in committing a crime, even if the plan never came to fruition. The other options are incorrect because they involve a more significant degree of criminal involvement that the defendant did not actually commit to.",
