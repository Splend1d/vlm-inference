We know that f(g(6)) = 13, so we can set up the equation:\n\nf(g(6)) = 13\nf(6) = 13\n\nSince f(x) = x + 5, we can find the value of 6:\n\n6 = 6 + 5\n6 = 11\n\nThis is not a valid solution, so we need to find another value of g(6). Let's try g(6) = 8:\n\nf(8) = 13\n8 = 8 + 5\n8 = 13\n\nThis is not a valid solution either. Let's try g(6) = 16:\n\nf(16) = 13\n16 = 16 + 5\n16 = 21\n\nThis is not a valid solution either. Let's try g(6) = 32:\n\nf(32) = 13\n32 = 32 + 5\n32 = 37\n\nThis is not a valid solution either. Since none of these values are valid, we cannot find a value of g(6) that satisfies the equation f(g(6)) = 13. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of 2 * g(6).\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D represent the correct value of 2 * g(6).",
