The state's best rebuttal to this argument would be option A: \"The defendant was not entitled to be re-warned of his Miranda rights in the patrol car.\" This is because, as the question states, the defendant responded that he would not make any statement until he consulted his attorney, which indicates that he understood and waived his Miranda rights. Therefore, the re-warning of his rights in the patrol car would not have been necessary.",
