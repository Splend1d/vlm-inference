At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.\n\nDr. Ramchandran's research found that brushing teeth after lunch significantly reduced the number of cavities in patients. The newswriter's statement that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities is based on this research. Therefore, the newswriter's statement is justified if at least 100 patients brushed their teeth after lunch, as this would provide evidence to support the claim that brushing teeth after lunch reduces cavities. The other options are not supported by the information given in the problem.",
