The muckrakers were a group of investigative journalists who exposed the corruption and injustices of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They focused on issues such as labor conditions, child labor, and poverty, and used their investigative reporting to bring attention to these problems and push for change. Riis's work in \"How the Other Half Lives\" is an example of this type of investigative journalism, as he exposes the harsh conditions and poverty of the working class in New York City.",
