This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.\nD. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.\n\nExplanation: A simple random sample is one in which each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. In this case, the researcher is obtaining a sample of principals from each of the 125 school districts, rather than sampling from the entire group of principals. This method is considered to be easier and less costly than other sampling methods, such as cluster sampling or systematic sampling.\n\nOption B is incorrect because cluster sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous groups or clusters, rather than dividing it into heterogeneous groups as described in the question. Option C is incorrect because systematic sampling does not involve sampling from the entire population, but rather involves selecting a simple random sample from the population based on a systematic order. Option D is incorrect because stratification in sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous groups based on certain characteristics, and comparing the groups would not necessarily give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.",
