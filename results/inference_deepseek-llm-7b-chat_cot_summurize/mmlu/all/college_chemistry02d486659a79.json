You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The Henry\u2019s law constant for CO2 dissolved in water at 25\u00b0C is 30.0 atm M^\u22121. The concentration of dissolved CO2 in a vessel pressurized with 2.0 atm of CO2 is\n\nA. 1.5 M\nB. 0.15 M\nC. 0.067 M\nD. 0.015 M\n\nassistant:To find the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the vessel, we can use Henry's law constant (H) and the partial pressure of CO2 (P1) as follows:\n\nc = H * P1 / (T + P1)\n\nwhere c is the concentration of dissolved CO2, H is the Henry's law constant, P1 is the partial pressure of CO2, and T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nGiven the values:\nH = 30.0 atm M^\u22121\nP1 = 2.0 atm\nT = 25\u00b0C = 298.15 K\n\nWe can plug these values into the equation:\n\nc = 30.0 atm M^\u22121 * 2.0 atm / (298.15 K + 2.0 atm)\nc = 60.0 M^\u22121 atm * 2.0 atm / 300.15 K\nc = 0.067 M\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.067 M.",
