The kinetochore interacts with microtubules from the spindle, which help pull the sister chromatids apart during cell division. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. chromatophore is a structure found in certain organisms that produces colors, and it is not related to cell division.\nB. chromomere is a term used to describe the functional units of a chromosome, and it is not a specific location.\nD. centriole is a structure found in eukaryotic cells that helps organize the microtubules in the cell, but it is not the site of attachment for the mitotic spindle.",
