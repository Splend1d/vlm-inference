The flow is streamlined with constant flow rate. The diameter of the pipe at Point 1 is d and the flow speed is V. If the diameter of the pipe at Point 2 is d/3, then the pressure at Point 2 is\n\nA. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2\nB. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2\nC. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2\nD. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2\n\nassistant:Let's use the Bernoulli's equation to solve this problem. According to the Bernoulli's equation, the total energy of a fluid in motion is constant along a streamline. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\np1 + \u03c1v1^2/2 + \u03c1gh1 = p2 + \u03c1v2^2/2 + \u03c1gh2\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the pressure at Point 1 and Point 2 respectively, \u03c1 is the fluid density, v1 and v2 are the flow speeds at Point 1 and Point 2 respectively, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSince the flow is streamlined, we can assume that the flow speed at Point 1 and Point 2 are constant, i.e., v1 = v2 = V/2 (the flow speed at Point 1 is twice the flow speed at Point 2).\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values into the equation:\n\np1 + \u03c1(V/2)^2/2 + \u03c1gh1 = p2 + \u03c1(V/4)^2/2 + \u03c1gh2\n\nNow, we need to find the pressure difference between Point 1 and Point 2. Since the pressure at Point 1 is not given, let's assume it's P (pressure at Point 1).\n\nP + \u03c1(V/2)^2/2 + \u03c1gh1 = p2 + \u03c1(V/4)^2/2 + \u03c1gh2\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\np2 = P + \u03c1(V/2)^2/2 + \u03c1gh2 - (\u03c1(V/2)^2/2 + \u03c1gh1)\n\nNow, let's find the pressure difference between Point 1 and Point 2:\n\n\u0394P = p2 - P = \u03c1(V/2)^2/2 + \u03c1gh2 - (\u03c1(V/2)^2/2 + \u03c1gh1)\n\n\u0394P = 40\u03c1V^2/4 + \u03c1gh2 - 2\u03c1V^2/4 - \u03c1gh1\n\n\u0394P = 20\u03c1V^2/2 + \u03c1(gh2 - gh1)\n\nSince \u0394P is a positive quantity (it represents the pressure difference), we can ignore the terms with negative signs.\n\n\u0394P = 10\u03c1V^2\n\nNow, let's compare the pressure difference with the options given:\n\nA. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2:\n10\u03c1V^2 < 4 \u03c1V^2\n\nB. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2:\n10\u03c1V^2 < 40 \u03c1V^2\n\nC. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2:\n10\u03c1V^2 > 4 \u03c1V^2\n\nD. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2:\n10\u03c1V^2 > 40 \u03c1V^2\n\nThe correct answer is A, as the pressure difference between Point 1 and Point 2 is less than 4\u03c1V^2.",
