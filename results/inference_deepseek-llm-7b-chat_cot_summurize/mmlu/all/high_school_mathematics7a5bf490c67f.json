What is the positive difference between these solutions?\n\nA. 2\nB. \\sqrt{2}\nC. 5\\sqrt{2}\nD. 5\n\nassistant:To solve the quadratic equation $2x^2+5x+12=19-7x$, we first combine like terms:\n\n$2x^2+5x+12=19-7x$\n\n$2x^2-2x+19=12$\n\nNow, we can subtract 12 from both sides:\n\n$2x^2-2x+19-12=0$\n\n$2x^2-2x-7=0$\n\nWe can factor the quadratic:\n\n$(2x+1)(x-7)=0$\n\nNow we can find the solutions by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\n$2x+1=0$\n\n$x=-\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$x-7=0$\n\n$x=7$\n\nSo the solutions are $-\\frac{1}{2}$ and 7. The positive difference between these solutions is:\n\n$7-\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{9}{2}=\\boxed{4.5}$\n\nHowever, this option is not listed in the answer choices.
