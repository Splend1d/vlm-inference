This case established the principle that national courts should have some discretion in applying human rights law, known as the \"margin of appreciation.\"\n\nAirey v Ireland (1979) was the second case to use the margin of appreciation, but it did not define the doctrine. Osman v UK (1998) and Goodwin v UK (2002) both used the margin of appreciation, but they were later overruled by the ECtHR.",
