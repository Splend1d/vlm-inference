How does this withdrawal potentially impact money in circulation?\n\nA. Decreases it by $9 million\nB. Decreases it by $1 million\nC. Decreases it by $100000\nD. Increases it by $1 million\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's first break down the information given:\n\n1. The reserve ratio is 0.10, which means that for every $100 kept by the bank as reserves, there are $900 in circulation (since 100 - 10 = 90).\n2. Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and keeps it as cash in her refrigerator.\n3. We need to determine the potential impact on the money in circulation.\n\nNow let's calculate the impact of the withdrawal:\n\n1. Since Mommy Morebucks is keeping $1 million as cash, the amount of money in circulation has decreased by this amount.\n2. This means the total amount of money in circulation is now $900 million ($100 million * 9).\n3. To find out the potential impact on the money in circulation, we need to subtract the amount of money Mommy Morebucks kept as cash from the total money in circulation before the withdrawal.\n\nPotential impact on money in circulation = Total money in circulation before withdrawal - Amount of money kept by Mommy Morebucks\nPotential impact on money in circulation = $900 million - $1 million\nPotential impact on money in circulation = $899 million\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The withdrawal decreases the money in circulation by $1 million.",
