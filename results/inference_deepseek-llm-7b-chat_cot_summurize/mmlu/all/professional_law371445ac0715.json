The police did not have a warrant to search their car, and this is a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Therefore, the property confiscated by the police cannot be used as evidence in their trial.\n\nThe police did not have probable cause to suspect that their car contained evidence of the crime, and they did not attempt to get a warrant before searching the vehicle. In this case, the Fourth Amendment requires that the police have a warrant before they can search a person's property. Since the police did not have a warrant, the defendants' motion to suppress the evidence should be granted.\n\nThe defendants' detention was unlawful, and this means that any evidence obtained as a result of that detention cannot be used in their trial. In this case, the police stopped all the cars waiting for the ferry without attempting to get a warrant, and this means that their search of the defendants' vehicle was also unlawful. Therefore, the property confiscated by the police cannot be used as evidence in the defendants' trial.\n\nThe defendants' motion to suppress the use of the property confiscated by the police as evidence should be granted. The police did not have probable cause to suspect that their car contained evidence of the crime, and they did not attempt to get a warrant before searching the vehicle.
