Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice.\n\nassistant:The question asks us to compare two verses, one from the Qur'an and one from the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, and draw a conclusion from the comparison.\n\nThe first verse from the Qur'an, Sura 5:89, warns against the consumption of strong drink, games of chance, and idols, which are considered infamies of Satan's handiwork. This verse suggests that Muslims should avoid these things to succeed.\n\nThe second verse, from the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, talks about enjoying the roses and pouring wine when they are in bloom. This verse seems to be more about enjoying life's pleasures.\n\nComparing these two verses, we can see that they have different perspectives on life and religion. The Qur'an verse is focused on religious restrictions and avoiding certain activities, while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse is more about enjoying life's pleasures.\n\nBased on this comparison, the conclusion that best supports the comparison of both verses is:\n\nB. Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that the Qur'an verse warns against certain activities, while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse seems to suggest enjoying life's pleasures. It does not necessarily mean that religious restrictions were not observed, but rather that they were not universally observed by all Muslims, as some may have interpreted the verse in a different way.",
