Which expression is equal to the one used by Ms. Fisher?\n\nA. 6 + (8 + 12)\nB. 6 + (8 \u00d7 12)\nC. 6 \u00d7 (8 + 12)\nD. 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nassistant:The expression that Ms. Fisher used is (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12. To find the total number of markers needed for her students\u2019 art project, you can calculate it as follows:\n\n(6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 = 48 \u00d7 12 = 576\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12) = 576",
