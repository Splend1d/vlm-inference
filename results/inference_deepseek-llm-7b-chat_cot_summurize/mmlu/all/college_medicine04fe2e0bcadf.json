After putting on a shirt, you eventually no longer feel the sensation of the fabric on your back. This is an example of tactile adaptation, which is the process by which the brain becomes desensitized to a constant stimulus, such as the feeling of fabric on the skin.\n\nB. After first walking into a crowded room, you no longer are distracted by the buzz of conversation around you. This is an example of auditory adaptation, which is the process by which the brain adjusts to a constant stimulus, such as background noise.\n\nC. After first walking outside on a sunny day, you no longer are blinded by the initial brightness of the light. This is an example of photopic adaptation, which is the process by which the eye adjusts to changes in light intensity, such as moving from a dark room to a brightly lit area.\n\nD.
