While talking on her cellphone, she momentarily took her eyes off the road. The woman then drove through a red light and struck a police car driven by a police officer, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's presentation of evidence, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery. The motion for summary judgment should be\n\nA. granted, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.\nB. granted, because the police officer assumed the risk of injury by answering the emergency call.\nC. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.\nD. denied, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n\nassistant:The firefighter's rule, also known as the \"firefighter's exemption,\" is a legal doctrine that generally protects firefighters and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) from liability for injuries sustained while responding to an emergency call. The rule generally applies when a firefighter or EMT is responding to an emergency call, or in the process of responding, and is injured by a third party.\n\nIn the scenario provided, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car, injuring him. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car.\n\nBased on this information, the woman's motion for summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery should be granted. This is because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency, and the police officer was in the process of responding to an emergency when he was injured. Therefore, the firefighter's rule would generally apply to protect the police officer from liability for his injuries.",
