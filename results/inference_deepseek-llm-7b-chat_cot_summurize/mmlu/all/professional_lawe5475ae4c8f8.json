The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house. This is because, in a unilateral contract, one party makes an offer that the other party must accept or reject. In this case, the homeowner made an offer to pay $5,000 for the roofer to replace the tiles, and the roofer accepted the offer by purchasing the materials and equipment needed for the job. However, the homeowner later changed his mind and canceled the contract, so the roofer would have a valid claim for breach of contract.",
