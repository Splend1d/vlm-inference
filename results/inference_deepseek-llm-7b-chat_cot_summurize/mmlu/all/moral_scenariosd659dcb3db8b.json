In this scenario, the main character is at a restaurant and accidentally breaks some glass. Instead of cleaning up the mess, they sweep the broken glass into a dustpan, which is the wrong thing to do.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is a coworker who is trying to help a falling coworker land on a sofa.
