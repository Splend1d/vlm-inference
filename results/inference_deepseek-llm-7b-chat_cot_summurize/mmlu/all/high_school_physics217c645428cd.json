You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: A block is dragged along a table and experiences a frictional force, f, that opposes its movement. The force exerted on the block by the table is\n\nA. zero\nB. parallel to the table\nC. perpendicular to the table\nD. neither parallel nor perpendicular to the table\n\nassistant:The frictional force, f, that the block experiences is always perpendicular to the surface it is sliding on. This is because friction is the force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact with each other, and it acts perpendicular to the surface of contact. Therefore, the answer is C. perpendicular to the table.",
