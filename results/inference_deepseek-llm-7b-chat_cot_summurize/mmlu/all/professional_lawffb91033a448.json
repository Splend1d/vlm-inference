Rule against Remainders in the Grantees' Heirs.\n\nassistant:The common law doctrine that would be most applicable in the court's determination of the ownership of the property in this scenario is the Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. This doctrine states that a contingent remainder interest in property is destroyed if the condition on which it depends is fulfilled or fails to occur within a reasonable time. In this case, the cousin's conveyance to the farmer was contingent on the farmer's continued farming of the property. Since the cousin's death occurred within a reasonable time after conveying the property to the farmer, the remainder interest in the property vested in the homeowner's heirs, and the farmer's interest became void. Therefore, the homeowner's heirs would have a better title than the farmer and could bring suit to quiet title.",
