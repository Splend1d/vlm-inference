That the actual forelimbs of these mammals do not seem to be optimally arranged is because\n\nA. natural selection has not had sufficient time to create the optimal design in each case, but will do so given enough time.\nB. natural selection operates in ways that are beyond the capability of the human mind to comprehend.\nC. in many cases, phenotype is not merely determined by genotype, but by the environment as well.\nD. natural selection is generally limited to modifying structures that were present in previous generations and in previous species.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. natural selection has not had sufficient time to create the optimal design in each case, but will do so given enough time. This is because the text suggests that the forelimbs of various mammals are not optimally arranged, implying that natural selection has not had enough time to optimize the design yet.\n\nB. is incorrect because the text does not mention anything about the complexity of natural selection.\nC. is incorrect because the text does not mention anything about the influence of the environment on phenotype.\nD. is incorrect because the text does not suggest that natural selection is limited to modifying structures that were present in previous generations and previous species.",
