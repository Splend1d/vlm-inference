Adena\n\nassistant:The culture, previously known as the temple-mound builders, that primarily based their subsistence on maize and squash agriculture is the Mississippian culture. The Mississippian culture flourished in the Southeastern United States from around AD 900 to 1650 and was characterized by large, complex earthworks, including temples, plazas, and other public buildings. Maize and squash were the primary crops cultivated by the Mississippian people, and they also grew other crops such as beans, sunflowers, and tobacco. The Mississippian culture was also known for its advanced pottery and metalworking skills, as well as its trade networks that extended across the region.",
