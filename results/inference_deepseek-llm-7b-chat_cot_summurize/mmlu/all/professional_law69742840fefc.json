On Wednesday, the man slipped a note under his neighbor's door, which said:\"If you will mow my lawn by Saturday I will pay you $25. \"The neighbor mowed the lawn Friday afternoon, but the man refused to pay the $25. The court, in evaluating the relationship between the man and his neighbor, would most probably find that\n\nA. the neighbor's mowing of the lawn created a bilateral contract.\nB. the neighbor's mowing of the lawn created a unilateral contract.\nC. the note slipped under the door was an acceptance of a standing offer by the neighbor.\nD. the neighbor is only entitled to recover in quasi-contract for the reasonable value of the mowing of the lawn.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. the neighbor's mowing of the lawn created a unilateral contract.\n\nIn this case, the man offered to pay $25 if the neighbor mowed his lawn by Saturday. However, he did not specify the terms or conditions of the offer. The neighbor's mowing of the lawn was an acceptance of the man's offer, but it was not a bilateral contract because the man did not agree to pay the $25 in exchange for the neighbor mowing the lawn. Instead, it was a unilateral contract because the man's offer created an obligation for the neighbor to perform a specific task (mow the lawn) in exchange for a possible reward (payment of $25).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. a bilateral contract is a contract in which both parties agree to exchange something of value. In this case, the man's offer was not specific or clear, so it cannot be considered a bilateral contract.\n\nC. the note slipped under the door was not an acceptance of a standing offer by the neighbor, but rather an invitation to the neighbor to perform a specific task in exchange for a possible reward.\n\nD. the neighbor is not only entitled to recover in quasi-contract for the reasonable value of the mowing of the lawn, but also for the breach of contract by the man.",
