This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase.\n\nWhen potassium perchlorate dissolves in water, the resulting solution has a lower temperature than the initial temperature of the components. This is because the entropy of the solution decreases, as the particles in the solution become more organized and less random. Since the decrease in entropy is associated with the process of dissolving, the process is spontaneous.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the process is not necessarily exothermic, as the temperature decrease is not due to the release of heat. Option C is incorrect because the process is not necessarily an entropy decrease, as the decrease in entropy is associated with the process of dissolving. Option D is incorrect because the process is not necessarily exothermic, as the temperature decrease is not due to the release of heat.",
