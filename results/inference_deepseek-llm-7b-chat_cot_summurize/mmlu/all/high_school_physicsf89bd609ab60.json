During the examination, the lens is held a distance 0.3 m above the coin and is moved slowly to a distance of 0.1 m above the coin. During this process, what happens to the image of the coin?\n\nA. The image continually increases in size.\nB. The image continually decreases in size.\nC. The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size.\nD. The image flips over.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. The focal length of the convex lens is f = 0.2 m.\n2. The lens is initially held a distance d1 = 0.3 m above the coin.\n3. The lens is then moved to a distance d2 = 0.1 m above the coin.\n\nWhen the lens is held at a distance d1 from the coin, it forms a virtual image of the coin. As the lens is moved closer to the coin, the size of the image will decrease because of the concave nature of the lens.\n\nWhen the lens is held at a distance d2 from the coin, it forms a real image of the coin. The size of the image will increase as the distance between the lens and the image is greater than the focal length.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The image continually increases in size. - This is true.\n\nB. The image continually decreases in size. - This is not true. The image size will decrease when the lens is held at a distance d1, and increase when the lens is held at a distance d2.\n\nC. The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size. - This is not true. The image size will decrease when the lens is held at a distance d1 and increase when the lens is held at a distance d2.\n\nD. The image flips over. - This is not true. The image does not flip over.\n\nSo, the correct option is A. The image continually increases in size.",
