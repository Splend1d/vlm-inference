The increase in blood insulin concentration after consuming the food.\nD. The increase in blood insulin concentration after consuming the food compared with that after consuming an equivalent amount of white bread.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a particular food raises blood glucose levels after consumption. It is often used to compare the effects of different carbohydrates on blood glucose levels. The GI is typically based on a comparison of the effects of consuming a serving of a particular food (e.g. a serving of white bread) compared with a serving of a reference food (e.g. white bread) that has a known GI. Food with a high GI will raise blood glucose levels more quickly and to a greater extent than food with a low GI.",
