Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between the stock returns and the market returns. The goal of the regression is to estimate the beta, which measures the sensitivity of the stock returns to the market returns. Minimizing the stock's alpha, or idiosyncratic component, does not apply to simple linear regression.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simple linear regression does not fit the errors to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock's beta. Option C is incorrect because simple linear regression does not estimate the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns. Option D is incorrect because simple linear regression does not model market returns as a function of the stock returns and its beta.",
