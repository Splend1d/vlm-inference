Yes, provided there is evidence sufficient to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\n\nThe court should admit the informant's opinion testimony that the substance was cocaine if there is sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine. The absence of the actual cocaine and the informant's lack of formal training in identifying controlled substances do not necessarily preclude the introduction of her testimony.\n\nThe court must consider whether the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to testify as an expert in the field. If the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to testify as an expert, then her opinion testimony can be considered as substantive evidence. If the informant lacks the necessary expertise, her testimony may be inadmissible as an opinion that is not based on sufficient facts or data.\n\nIn this case, the informant's testimony that the substance tasted like cocaine and gave her a cocaine-like sensation may not be sufficient to establish that the substance was cocaine. However, if the court finds that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine, her testimony may be admissible as substantive evidence. The court must weigh the probative value of the informant's testimony against its potential for prejudice and undue confusion.",
