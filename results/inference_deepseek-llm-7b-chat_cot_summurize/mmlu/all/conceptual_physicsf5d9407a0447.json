This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. The Moon takes about 27.3 days to rotate once on its axis, which is almost exactly the same as the time it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around Earth, which is about 27.3 days. Therefore, the Moon's rotation period is considered to be about one month.",
