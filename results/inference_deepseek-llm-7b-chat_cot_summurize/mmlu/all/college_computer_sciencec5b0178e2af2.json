Increasing the clock cycle rate\nII. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline\nIII. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. I and III\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to consider the effects of each option on the execution time of a typical program.\n\nI. Increasing the clock cycle rate: This would reduce the time it takes for each instruction to execute, thus improving the overall execution time of the program.\n\nII. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline: This would increase the latency of the pipeline, as each instruction would have to wait for its dependent instructions to be completed before continuing. This would not improve the execution time of the program.\n\nIII. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time: This would allow the CPU to access more instructions and data simultaneously, reducing the need for memory accesses and thus improving the execution time of the program.\n\nTherefore, option D (I and III) is the correct answer, as both options would improve the execution time of a typical program.",
