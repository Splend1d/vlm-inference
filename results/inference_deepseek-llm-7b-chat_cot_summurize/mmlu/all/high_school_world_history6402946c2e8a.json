Africa's shortage of natural resources\n\nassistant:The passage describes the struggles of African nations to achieve political independence and national development, while recognizing the importance of unity and cooperation. The passage quotes Ghana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, who emphasizes the need for a common purpose, planning, and endeavor in order to create progress and contribute to world peace.\n\nOption A, a lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion, is not mentioned in the passage as a significant factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described.\n\nOption B, the spread of communism throughout the continent, is not mentioned in the passage as a factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described.\n\nOption C, armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers, is not mentioned in the passage as a significant factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described.\n\nOption D, Africa's shortage of natural resources, is not mentioned in the passage as a significant factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described.\n\nHowever, the passage does mention the consequences of colonial rule, which can be interpreted as a lack of control over resources and institutions. This suggests that a shortage of resources or a lack of control over resources may have played a role in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described. Therefore, the factor most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage is the lack of control over resources and institutions.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
