The sound waves enter the auditory canal, which is the passageway leading to the eardrum.\n2. These waves cause the eardrum to vibrate, which in turn causes the three ossicles (hammer, anvil, and stirrup) in the middle ear to move.\n3. These tiny bones transmit the vibrations to the oval window, which is a thin membrane that separates the middle ear from the fluid-filled cochlea.\n4. The vibrations transmitted through the oval window cause the basilar membrane in the cochlea to move. The basilar membrane is responsible for sensing different frequencies and pitches.\n5. Finally, the auditory nerve carries the information from the cochlea to the brain, where it is processed and interpreted as sound.",
