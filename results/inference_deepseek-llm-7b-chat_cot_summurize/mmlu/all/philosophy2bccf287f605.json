However, I can provide some context and reasoning for each of the given options.\n\nOption A: Rationalism is an approach that emphasizes the use of reason and logic in forming ethical judgments. It is not necessarily connected with turning to an ethical approach based on the virtues, as virtues can also be based on emotion, intuition, or other non-rational factors.\n\nOption B: Empiricism is an approach that emphasizes the use of empirical evidence and observation in forming ethical judgments. It is not necessarily connected with turning to an ethical approach based on the virtues, as virtues can also be based on personal experience, tradition, or other sources of knowledge.\n\nOption C: Relativism is an approach that asserts that ethical judgments are relative to individual perspectives and cultural backgrounds. It is not necessarily connected with turning to an ethical approach based on the virtues, as virtues can be seen as universal and applicable across different cultures and contexts.\n\nOption D: Absolutism is an approach that asserts that ethical judgments have absolute or universal standards. It is not necessarily connected with turning to an ethical approach based on the virtues, as virtues can be seen as relative to cultural and personal contexts.\n\nIn summary, Nussbaum's claim that turning to an ethical approach based on the virtues is connected with a turn toward rationalism is more in line with the options provided.",
