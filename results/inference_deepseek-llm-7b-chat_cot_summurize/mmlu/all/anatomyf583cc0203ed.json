Which of the following signs will be present?\n\nA. Pupillary constriction and a medial strabismus\nB. Pupillary dilatation and a medial strabismus\nC. Pupillary constriction and a lateral strabismus\nD. Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus\n\nassistant:The third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve, innervates the muscles of the eye, including the muscles that control pupil size (the dilator and constrictor muscles) and eye position (the medial and lateral recti muscles). Damage to this nerve can result in a variety of symptoms, including double vision (strabismus) and changes in pupil size.\n\nIf the oculomotor nerve is damaged, the patient may experience a combination of symptoms, including:\n\n* Medial strabismus: This occurs when the eyes point in different directions, causing double vision. The medial recti muscles are innervated by the oculomotor nerve, so damage to this nerve can result in medial strabismus.\n* Pupillary constriction: The dilator muscle of the pupil is innervated by the oculomotor nerve, so damage to this nerve can result in a lack of ability to constrict the pupil. The patient's pupils may remain dilated, even in bright light.\n\nBased on these symptoms, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Pupillary constriction and a medial strabismus.",
