The failure to act is much less culpable than active recklessness, and therefore there was insufficient evidence to charge manslaughter.\nC.

This is because the general manager was aware of the safety concerns and did not take appropriate action to address them, which led to the tragic accident. The omission to respond to safety citations is considered a high degree of criminal negligence, and as a result, the general manager will be charged with involuntary manslaughter.",
