Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.\nD. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n\nUnder the terms of their written distribution agreement, the distributor's acceptance of the retailer's orders is expressly conditioned on such acceptance. Since the distributor filled the retailer's orders for two years without any dispute, it can be inferred that they agreed to this course of dealing. Therefore, the distributor is bound by this course of dealing and must fill the retailer's order.\n\nThe distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is not relevant to its obligation to fill the retailer's order. Moreover, the retailer's practice of overcharging customers does not excuse the distributor's refusal to fill the order. The distributor's refusal to fill the order is a breach of contract and could result in legal consequences for the distributor.\n\nTherefore, the retailer has a strong likelihood of prevailing in a breach of contract lawsuit against the distributor, as the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.",
