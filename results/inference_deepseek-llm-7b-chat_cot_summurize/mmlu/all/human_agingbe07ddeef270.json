Vitamin D\nB. Niacin\nC. Thiamine\nD. Riboflavin\n\nassistant:B. Niacin is known to help lower bad cholesterol levels in the body. It is a type of B vitamin that can be found in foods like beef, fish, and fortified cereals, or taken as a supplement. Niacin has been shown to improve cholesterol levels by increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is often referred to as the \"good\" cholesterol, and reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is known as the \"bad\" cholesterol.\n\nA. Vitamin D is important for overall health, but it does not have a direct effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nC. Thiamine and D. Riboflavin are both B vitamins that are essential for various bodily functions, but they do not have a significant impact on cholesterol levels.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, B. Niacin appears to be the option that can help lower bad cholesterol levels.",
