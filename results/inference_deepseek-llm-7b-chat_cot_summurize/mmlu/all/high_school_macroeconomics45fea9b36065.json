The equilibrium price will rise and the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nWhen producers expect the price of a good to be higher in the near future, they will likely increase the quantity produced. This increase in supply will lead to a decrease in the price of the good, as there is now more supply than demand. Therefore, the equilibrium price will fall, and the equilibrium quantity will also fall as the new equilibrium price is reached.",
