What is the number?\n\nA. 17\nB. 6\nC. 2\nD. 11\n\nassistant:Let the number be $x$. The problem states that $85 = (x^2) + 17x - 17$. Rearranging the equation gives $x^2 + 17x - 88 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic gives $(x + 14)(x - 6) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives $x + 14 = 0$ or $x - 6 = 0$. Therefore, the possible values for $x$ are $-14$ and $6$. The only valid option among the choices is $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}}$, which is the number $2$.",
