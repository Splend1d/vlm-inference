The gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h, and it was recorded by a camera on a platform 200 meters away traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. If the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800Hz, what is the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at?\n\nA. 941 Hz\nB. 787 Hz\nC. 924 Hz\nD. 912 Hz\n\nassistant:To calculate the perceived frequency of the gunshot picked up by the camera, we need to consider the relative speed of the source and receiver. In this case, the source (the actor inside the car) is moving relative to the camera (the platform on which the camera is mounted). \n\nFirst, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to m/s:\n\nRelative speed = 108 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = (108 * 1000) / 3600 = 30 m/s\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time it takes for the sound wave to travel from the source to the camera. We know the distance is 200 meters and the initial frequency is 800 Hz. We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed of Sound * Frequency\n\nTime = 200 m / (331 m/s) * 800 Hz = 0.0597 s\n\nNow we can calculate the perceived frequency using the time-of-arrival effect. The time-of-arrival effect states that the perceived frequency of a sound is higher when the sound source is moving away from the listener compared to when the sound source is moving towards the listener.\n\nIn this case, the source is moving away from the camera, so the perceived frequency will be higher than the initial frequency of 800 Hz. We can calculate the perceived frequency using the following formula:\n\nPerceived Frequency = Initial Frequency * (1 - (Distance/Speed of Sound * Time))\n\nPerceived Frequency = 800 Hz * (1 - (200 m / (331 m/s) * 0.0597 s)) \u2248 800 Hz * (1 - 0.1628) \u2248 800 Hz * 0.8372 \u2248 670 Hz\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this result.
