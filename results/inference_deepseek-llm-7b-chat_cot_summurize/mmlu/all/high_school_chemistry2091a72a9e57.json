Hydrogen bonds are formed between a highly electronegative atom (usually hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen) and a more electropositive atom that has a partial positive charge. In this case, all of the given options have a highly electronegative atom (nitrogen in the case of D) or oxygen, which can form hydrogen bonds.",
