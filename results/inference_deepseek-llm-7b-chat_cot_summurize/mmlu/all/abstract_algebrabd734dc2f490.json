Statement 2 | A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if thenumber of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.\nThis statement is false. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, the possible orders of groups are 1, 3, 5, 15. Since the order of the group is 45, which is a composite number, it cannot be a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Therefore, there is no abelian group of order 45 with a subgroup of order 10.\n\nStatement 2: A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\nThis statement is true. A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H in G is equal to the number of right cosets of H in G. This is known as the normality criterion for subgroups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
