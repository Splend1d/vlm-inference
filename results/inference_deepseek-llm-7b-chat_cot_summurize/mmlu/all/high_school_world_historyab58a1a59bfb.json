The second passage states that violence was an essential component of British rule in India, and the revolt shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence with an indigenous violence of the colonized. Neither passage suggests that the British deaths were a betrayal of a higher race by a lesser race (A), nor that they were a religious duty (D). The second passage implies that the British deaths were regrettable but avoidable mistakes (B).",
