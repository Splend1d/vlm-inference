This is because Callahan may believe that legalizing euthanasia would send the message that it is acceptable to end a person's life prematurely, which he may consider morally wrong. Additionally, Callahan may also believe that this could lead to a slippery slope where euthanasia becomes more widespread and accepted, potentially leading to abuse of the practice.",
