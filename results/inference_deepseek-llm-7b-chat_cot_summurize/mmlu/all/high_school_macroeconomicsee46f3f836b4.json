To close a recessionary gap, the economy needs to increase aggregate demand. This can be achieved by shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right. This means that consumers need to increase their spending, businesses need to increase their investment, and government spending needs to increase to boost aggregate demand.\n\nOption B is incorrect because shifting the aggregate demand curve to the left would decrease aggregate demand and make the recessionary gap even worse.\n\nOption C is incorrect because shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right or left does not necessarily address the issue of a recessionary gap. The aggregate supply curve represents the relationship between the quantity of goods and services produced by the economy and the price level, and it is not directly related to aggregate demand.\n\nOption D is incorrect because shifting the aggregate supply curve to the left would decrease the price level, which might reduce inflation but would not necessarily increase aggregate demand or close the recessionary gap.",
