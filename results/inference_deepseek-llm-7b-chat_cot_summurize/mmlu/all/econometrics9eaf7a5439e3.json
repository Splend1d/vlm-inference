Uncorrelated.\n\nWhen the standard tools for time-series analysis, such as estimation of the autocorrelation function (acf), partial autocorrelation function (pacf), and spectral analysis, find no evidence of structure in the data, it implies that the data are uncorrelated. This means that the relationships between different points in the time series are not consistent and do not form a pattern, making it difficult to make meaningful predictions or interpretations based on the data.",
