Current in one direction: This option does not directly relate to causing an electric shock.\nB. Presence of moisture: While moisture can increase the severity of an electric shock, it is not a necessary factor for an electric shock to occur.\nC. High voltage and low body resistance: This option is correct, as it describes the voltage difference between the body and the ground or the electrical source that causes an electric shock.\nD. Voltage difference across part or all of your body: This option is also correct, as it describes the essential factor for an electric shock to occur.\n\nStep 3: Choose the best answer\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Voltage difference across part or all of your body.",
