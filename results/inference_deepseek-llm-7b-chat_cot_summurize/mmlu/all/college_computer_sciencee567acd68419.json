We know that the parallel program computation requires 100 seconds when executed on a single processor.\n2. 40 percent of the computation is inherently sequential, meaning it does not benefit from additional processors.\n3. So, 60 percent of the computation can be parallelized.\n4. We want to find the theoretically best possible elapsed times for this program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the theoretical best possible elapsed time for the 40 percent inherently sequential part of the computation.\n\nSince 40 percent of the computation is inherently sequential, we can assume that it takes 0.4 * 100 = 40 seconds to complete on a single processor.\n\nNow let's find the theoretical best possible elapsed time for the 60 percent parallelizable part of the computation.\n\nIf we have 2 processors, the maximum amount of work each processor can do is 60 percent / 2 = 30 percent.\n\nSince 30 percent of the computation is parallelizable, we can assume that it takes 0.3 * 100 = 30 seconds to complete on 2 processors.\n\nNow let's find the theoretical best possible elapsed time for the 4 processors.\n\nIf we have 4 processors, the maximum amount of work each processor can do is 60 percent / 4 = 15 percent.\n\nSince 15 percent of the computation is parallelizable, we can assume that it takes 0.15 * 100 = 15 seconds to complete on 4 processors.\n\nTherefore, the theoretically best possible elapsed times for this program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively, are 30 and 15 seconds.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 30 and 15 seconds.",
