Yes, because it is prior testimony of an unavailable declarant.\n\nThe witness's testimony in the criminal trial is admissible in the civil action as prior testimony of an unavailable declarant. In a criminal trial, the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt, while in a civil action, the standard is a preponderance of the evidence. Since the two actions have different burdens of proof, the same testimony is admissible in both. Additionally, the fact that the witness has moved to a foreign country does not automatically render their testimony inadmissible, as long as the investor can demonstrate that they were unable to obtain the testimony through deposition.",
