In this case, the defendant was charged with both larceny (the theft of the car) and malicious destruction of property. The judge's instruction seemed to suggest that the theft of the car was sufficient evidence to satisfy the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. This is incorrect because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property. Larceny is a separate crime that does not necessarily imply the act of malicious destruction of property. The defendant could have stolen the car without causing any damage to the property, and therefore the theft of the car alone would not be sufficient evidence to prove malice for the malicious destruction of property charge. Therefore, the judge's instruction was incorrect.",
