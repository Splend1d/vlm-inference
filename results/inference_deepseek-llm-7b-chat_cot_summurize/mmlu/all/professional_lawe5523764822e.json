The remainder in his heirs would not become vested into a full fee in those heirs, as the nephew could only convey a life estate.\nC. The nephew's heirs do not receive a vested indefeasible interest in the property, as they can only inherit a life estate from the nephew.\nD. The grantor does not have a reversionary interest at the termination of the nephew's life estate, as the nephew could only convey a life estate and not a fee simple absolute.",
