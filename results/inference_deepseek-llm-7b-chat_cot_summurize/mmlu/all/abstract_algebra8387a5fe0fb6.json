Then which one of the following is TRUE for G?\n\nA. g = g^-1 for every g in G\nB. g = g^2 for every g in G\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\nD. G is of finite order\n\nassistant:To determine which of the given statements is true for the abelian group G, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. g = g^-1 for every g in G\n\nAn abelian group is one in which the group operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements a and b in G, a * b = b * a. This property is directly related to the inverse element g^-1. If g = g^-1 for every g in G, then the group operation is commutative. Therefore, this statement is true for the abelian group G.\n\nB. g = g^2 for every g in G\n\nThe square of an element g in a group is g^2. If g = g^2 for every g in G, then the group operation is idempotent, meaning that applying the operation twice results in the same element. This is a characteristic of abelian groups, but it is not a strict requirement. Therefore, this statement is also true for the abelian group G.\n\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\n\nThe group operation is associative, meaning that for any elements g, h, and k in G, (g o h) o k = g o (h o k). If (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g, h in G, then the group operation is commutative. However, this statement is equivalent to option A, which we already determined to be true for the abelian group G. Therefore, this statement is also true for the abelian group G.\n\nD. G is of finite order\n\nThe order of an element g in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group. If G is of finite order, then there exists a positive integer n such that every element in G can be written as a power of some element in G. This property is not directly related to the abelian property, as there are abelian groups of infinite order (e.g., the set of integers Z under addition). Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true for the abelian group G.\n\nIn conclusion, options A and B are true for the abelian group G.",
