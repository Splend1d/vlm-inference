This is generally considered a morally good action as it helps to keep the environment clean and tidy.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character keeps a lot of comics in their bedroom. While this action is not necessarily morally wrong, it is not necessarily morally good either. It does not have a clear moral impact on others or the environment.",
