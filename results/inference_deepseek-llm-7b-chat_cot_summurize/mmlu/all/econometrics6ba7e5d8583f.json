Zero skewness and zero kurtosis\nB. Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three\nC. Skewness of one and zero kurtosis\nD. Skewness of one and kurtosis of three.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Under the null hypothesis of a Brera-Jarque test, the distribution has zero skewness and zero kurtosis. This is because the Brera-Jarque test is used to test the null hypothesis that the sample comes from a normal distribution. If the null hypothesis is true, then the distribution should be symmetric and have a constant variance, which implies zero skewness and zero kurtosis.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Brera-Jarque test does not assume a specific skewness value.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Brera-Jarque test does not assume a specific skewness value.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Brera-Jarque test does not assume a specific kurtosis value.",
