Egyptian\nC. Mesopotamian\nD. Chinese\n\nassistant:The Indus Valley civilization has the written language that is the furthest from being fully deciphered. The Indus Valley script, also known as the Harappan script, is a series of symbols found on seals, stamps, and pottery from the Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished from 3300 to 1300 BCE. However, the script remains undeciphered and its meaning is still a subject of research and debate among scholars.\n\nThe Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Chinese civilizations have all had their written languages fully deciphered. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, for example, have been deciphered by scholars for centuries, while the cuneiform script of Mesopotamia and the Chinese\u7532\u9aa8\u6587 (ancient script) have also been deciphered.",
