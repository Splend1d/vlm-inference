According to the laws of thermodynamics, the enthalpy change (\u2206H) is positive, and the entropy change (\u2206S) is also positive. The positive entropy change indicates that the system becomes more disordered as it transitions to the liquid state, while the positive enthalpy change indicates that the system gains energy.",
