The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nThe correct answer is D because the final temperature of the mixture is 35 \u00b0C, which is less than the average starting temperature of the sample (25 \u00b0C) and the water (22 \u00b0C), which means that the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained. This statement is incorrect because the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained. This statement is also incorrect because the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water. This statement is irrelevant to the total energy of the sample and water, and is therefore incorrect.",
