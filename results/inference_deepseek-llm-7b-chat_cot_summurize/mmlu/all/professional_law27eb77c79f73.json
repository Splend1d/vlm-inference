Yes, because the stockbroker put himself in a position of peril.\nD. Yes, because he succeeded in saving the stockbroker's life.\n\nassistant:The taxi driver's actions were motivated by a desire to prevent the stockbroker from committing suicide, not by any intention to harm him. Therefore, if the taxi driver asserts a claim against the stockbroker to recover damages for his injuries, he would likely prevail based on the reasoning that the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself. So, the correct answer is A. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.",
