The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils.

The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.\nC. In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits.

The President's decision to abrogate the Commission of Birdwatchers is unconstitutional because it undermines the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government. The President does not have the authority to unilaterally abolish a law passed by Congress. This order may be seen as an abuse of power and an attempt to undermine the authority of Congress. The other options do not violate the Constitution, as they are either within the President's executive powers (A and B) or involve the President's emergency powers (D).",
