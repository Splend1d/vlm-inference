Material misrepresentation and breach of contract.\nB. Freedom from contributory negligence and loss.\nC. Scienter and justifiable reliance.\nD. Intent to deceive and privity.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Scienter and justifiable reliance.\n\nA material misrepresentation occurs when there is a false statement of fact made by one party to another party that is material to the contract. A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to perform their contractual obligations. In order for a client to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud, they must prove that the accountant made a material misrepresentation and breached their contractual obligations.\n\nFreedom from contributory negligence and loss refers to the defense of contributory negligence, which can be used by the defendant to reduce or eliminate their liability if the plaintiff contributed to the loss. This is not relevant to holding an accountant liable for common law fraud.\n\nIntent to deceive and privity refer to the requirement that there be an intention to deceive and a relationship of privity between the parties. Privity refers to the relationship between the parties to a contract. In order for an accountant to be liable for common law fraud, it must be proven that the accountant had the intention to deceive and that there was a relationship of privity between the parties. However, this is not the primary requirement for holding an accountant liable for common law fraud.\n\nJustifiable reliance refers to the relationship between the parties in a contract. It is the requirement that the plaintiff must have justifiable reliance on the defendant's actions. This means that the plaintiff must have had a reasonable basis for believing the defendant's statements or actions. In order for a client to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud, they must prove that the plaintiff had justifiable reliance on the accountant's actions.",
