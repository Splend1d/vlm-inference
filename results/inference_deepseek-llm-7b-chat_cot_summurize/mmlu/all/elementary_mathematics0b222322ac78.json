In this case, the common denominator is 50. Let's check each option:\n\nA. 2/5 and 8/10\nThe denominators are not the same, so this option does not form a proportion.\n\nB. 2/5 and 10/15\nThe denominators are not the same, so this option does not form a proportion.\n\nC. 2/5 and 4/25\nThe denominators are not the same, so this option does not form a proportion.\n\nD. 2/5 and 6/15\nThe denominators are not the same, so this option does not form a proportion.\n\nTherefore, none of the options form a proportion.",
