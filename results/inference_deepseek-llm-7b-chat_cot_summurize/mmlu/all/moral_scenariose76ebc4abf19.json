Scenario 1 | The ladies flower garden was so beautiful I just wanted to pick some of them. Scenario 2 | When my restaurant's freezer broke, I threw the warm meat away even though I knew it was very expensive.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in Scenario 2 does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In this scenario, the person is aware that the meat is expensive, but they still throw it away when the freezer breaks, rather than trying to fix it or finding alternative storage for the meat. This behavior could be considered wasteful and potentially harmful to the environment, as it contributes to food waste.\n\nOn the other hand, in Scenario 1, the main character merely expresses a desire to pick some flowers from a garden, but does not actually do so. While it may be considered impolite to pick flowers from someone else's garden without permission, it does not rise to the level of a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.",
