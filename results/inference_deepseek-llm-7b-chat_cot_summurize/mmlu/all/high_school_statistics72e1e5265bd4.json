There is insufficient information to answer this question.\n\nassistant:The probability of a Type II error is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. To calculate this probability, we can use the formula:\n\nP(Type II error) = 1 - P(Type I error)\n\nwhere P(Type I error) is the probability of a Type I error, which is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\nGiven that the significance level (\u03b1) is 0.10, we can use the formula for the probability of a Type I error:\n\nP(Type I error) = 1 - \u03b2\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the significance level (\u03b1).\n\nP(Type I error) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of a Type II error:\n\nP(Type II error) = 1 - P(Type I error) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 0.10.",
