Economic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation.\"\nD. A majority of Northern black voters abandoned the Democrat party, siding with Republicans.\n\nassistant:The passage provided by the user discusses the Great Society, which was a vision for a more equitable and prosperous society in the United States. It emphasizes the importance of education, leisure, and the environment, as well as the need to address issues of poverty and racial injustice.\n\nOption A, which mentions liberal Democrats abandoning anti-war protests in support of President Johnson, is not a consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s. Instead, it describes a development that occurred during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a liberal Democrat.\n\nOption C, which mentions economic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation,\" could be seen as a consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s. The passage does not mention stagflation, but it does suggest that the Great Society was intended to address issues of poverty and racial injustice. Increased government spending could have contributed to stagflation, which is characterized by high inflation and low economic growth.\n\nOption D, which mentions a majority of Northern black voters abandoning the Democrat party, siding with Republicans, is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does not provide information on political party affiliation or shifts in voting patterns.\n\nOption B, which mentions conservative Republicans mobilizing to defend traditional mores and curb government authority, could also be seen as a consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s. The passage does not mention conservative Republicans, but the civil rights movement and other liberal initiatives in the 1960s may have motivated conservatives to resist change and defend traditional values.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the most plausible answer is option C, as it describes an economic consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s that could have been related to the policies and initiatives discussed in the passage.",
