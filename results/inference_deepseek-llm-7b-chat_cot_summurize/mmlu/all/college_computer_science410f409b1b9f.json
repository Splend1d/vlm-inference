Execute the assignment A := B + C first.\n2. Execute the assignment B := A - B, which cancels out A.\n3. Execute the assignment C := A * E, which is now a constant value.\n4. Execute the assignment D := A/F, which is now a constant value.\n5. Execute the assignment E := B - C, which is now a constant value.\n6. Execute the assignment F := A + B, which is now a constant value.\n\nSince the assignments cancel out each other, we can conclude that the minimum number of time units needed to execute the assignments is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1.",
