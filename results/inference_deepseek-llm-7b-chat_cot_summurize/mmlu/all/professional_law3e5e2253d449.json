The establishment and apportionment of congressional districts directly affects interstate commerce, as they determine which representatives will be elected to represent the interests of different regions and states. Therefore, it is within the purview of Congress to use its plenary authority over such commerce for any purpose it believes will promote the general welfare.\n\nThe other options do not provide a strong enough basis for the constitutionality of the new statute. Option A is not a strong argument because the Constitution does not explicitly state that the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is subject to exceptions and regulations made by Congress. Option B is not a strong argument because the constitutional principle of separation of powers does not authorize Congress to pass statutes that directly restrict the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. Option D is not a strong argument because the Fifteenth Amendment does not authorize Congress to enforce its provisions by restricting the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.",
