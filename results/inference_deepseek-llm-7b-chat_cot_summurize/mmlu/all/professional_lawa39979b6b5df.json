Since the contract stipulated that it was FOB at the seller's place of business, the risk of loss was on the seller. Therefore, the buyer would succeed in their action for breach of contract, as the seller is responsible for delivering the goods in good condition and ensuring that the goods are not damaged during transportation.",
