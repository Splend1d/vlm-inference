This process leads to the formation of multiple copies of a single chromosome, which can then be observed under a light microscope. These chromosomes are involved in various cellular processes such as gene expression and cell differentiation.\n\nTo answer this question, I used my knowledge of genetics and cell biology to understand the process of polytene chromosomes formation and their function.",
