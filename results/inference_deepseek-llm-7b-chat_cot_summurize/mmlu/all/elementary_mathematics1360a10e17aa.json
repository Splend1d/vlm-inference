At that rate, how long will it take him to read a 320-page book?\n\nA. 16 hours\nB. 18 hours\nC. 24 hours\nD. 32 hours\n\nassistant:To determine how long it will take Jerry to read a 320-page book at the same rate, we can set up a proportion:\n\n200 pages / 10 hours = 320 pages / x hours\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:\n\n200 * x = 320 * 10\n200x = 3200\nx = 3200 / 200\nx = 16\n\nSo, it will take Jerry 16 hours to read a 320-page book at the same rate. The correct answer is A. 16 hours.",
