The natural rate of unemployment includes both structural and cyclical unemployment. Structural unemployment occurs when there is a mismatch between the skills of the workers and the skills required by the job. Cyclical unemployment occurs when there is a downturn in the economy, causing businesses to lay off workers. Frictional unemployment, on the other hand, is the temporary unemployment that occurs when workers search for a job or change jobs.",
