This means that the land use regulations have changed, and the original residential zoning no longer applies. As a result, the residency restriction in the deeds is no longer enforceable, as it is no longer applicable to the current zoning.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court will most likely hold that the residency restriction is no longer enforceable due to the change in the character of the neighborhood surrounding the development, not because of the change in zoning.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the residency restriction is still enforceable, as the area surrounding the development is still zoned for residential use.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the operation of a beauty parlor in a residential lot would constitute a violation of the residency restriction, as it is not allowed for commercial purposes.",
