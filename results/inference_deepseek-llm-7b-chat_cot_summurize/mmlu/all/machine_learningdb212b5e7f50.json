Statement 2| Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:A. True, True\n\nThe first statement is true. L2 regularization of linear models indeed makes models more sparse than L1 regularization. The L1 penalty, also known as Lasso, tends to produce sparse solutions (i.e., many coefficients are set to zero) by setting the absolute value of some coefficients to zero. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge, tends to produce slightly less sparse solutions, as it introduces a penalty for the magnitude of the coefficients.\n\nThe second statement is also true. Residual connections can be found in ResNets (Residual Neural Networks) and Transformers. In ResNets, residual connections are used to help the network learn more efficiently by allowing the network to skip some computations and compare its output to the desired output. In Transformers, residual connections are used in a slightly different way, as they help to propagate information between different layers of the model.",
