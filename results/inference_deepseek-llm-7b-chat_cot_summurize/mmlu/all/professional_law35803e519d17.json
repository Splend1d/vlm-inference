No damages, because the pedestrian's refusal of treatment constitutes contributory negligence.\n\nassistant:The pedestrian's estate can collect damages for the wound and the pain and suffering up to the point that she refused the transfusion. This is because the driver of the car negligently hit the pedestrian, and the pedestrian's refusal to accept treatment was not a contributing factor to her death. The physician's verification that the patient would have fully recovered if she had agreed to treatment supports this. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",
