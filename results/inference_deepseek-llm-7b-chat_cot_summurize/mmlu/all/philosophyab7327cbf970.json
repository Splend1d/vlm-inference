According to Epictetus, people are responsible for their own emotions, and they should not blame external circumstances for their feelings. In this case, when someone strikes you, what really angers you is your own judgment, according to Epictetus. This means that you might judge the situation as unfair or unjust, which in turn causes you to feel angry or upset. By understanding this, you can learn to control your emotions and respond to situations in a more positive and constructive way.",
