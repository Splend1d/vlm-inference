He asserts that we are each responsible for our poverty.\nD. He rejects the idea of equality altogether.\n\nassistant:D. He rejects the idea of equality altogether.\n\nParfit's main concern with equality is that he believes it is not possible to achieve perfect equality in a society. Instead, he argues that there will always be differences in the wealth, status, and abilities of individuals, and that trying to eliminate these differences will only lead to frustration and disappointment.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect Parfit's views on equality. He does not believe that an unequal society is inevitable, nor does he suggest that giving priority to the needs of the poor can increase equality. Similarly, he does not assert that we are each responsible for our poverty. Instead, he argues that equality is an unattainable goal and that differences in wealth, status, and abilities are natural and necessary.",
