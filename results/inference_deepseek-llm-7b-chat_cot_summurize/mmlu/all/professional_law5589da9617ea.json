Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for\n\nA.

Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.\nD. Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.\n\nUnder the common law, a contract is considered a contract for the sale of goods if the main purpose of the contract is for the sale of goods. In this case, Connie purchased a laptop computer for $1,000, and the service agreement was an additional contract. The main purpose of the contract was the sale of goods, so the trial court is likely to find for Connie.\n\nB, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract. This is incorrect because the UCC does not apply to this situation, as it only applies to the sale of goods.\n\nC. Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract. This is also incorrect because the UCC does not apply to this situation.\n\nD. Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement. This is incorrect because the court will likely find for Connie under the common law, not based on intent or relative dollars, but based on the main purpose of the contract.",
