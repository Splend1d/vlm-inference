The defendant's attorney's objection is valid, as the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a result, the supervisor's testimony should not be allowed as it would be violative of the best evidence rule, which states that the original records or documents are considered the best evidence of the facts they relate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.",
