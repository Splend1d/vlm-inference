NAD+ + H+ + 2e- \u2192 NADH\nD. ADP + P \u2192 ATP\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. pyruvate \u2192 ethanol.\n\nDuring glycolysis, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle). In fermentation, on the other hand, pyruvate is converted to either lactate or ethanol, depending on the type of organism. In the case of yeast, it produces ethanol, while in muscle cells, it produces lactate.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. pyruvate \u2192 lactate: This occurs during fermentation, not during glycolysis.\nC. NAD+ + H+ + 2e- \u2192 NADH: This is the chemical reaction that occurs during both glycolysis and fermentation, but it is not the specific reaction that occurs in the reverse direction during fermentation.\nD. ADP + P \u2192 ATP: This is the process of cellular respiration, which occurs during glycolysis and fermentation, but it is not the specific reaction that occurs in the reverse direction during fermentation.",
