When he arrived at the site with the supplies he found a message from the homeowner that he revoked the offer. Can the homeowner revoke the offer under these circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\nB. No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation.\nC. No, because the offer had to remain open for a reasonable period of time before it could be revoked.\nD. Yes, because an oral offer to enter a bilateral contract is never enforceable.\n",
