For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately\n\nA. 500 J\nB. 1,000 J\nC. 1,100 J\nD. 2,000 J\n\nassistant:The answer is D. 2,000 J.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for heat transfer: Q = m \\* c \\* \u0394T, where Q is the heat transfer, m is the mass of the substance, c is the specific heat capacity of the substance, and \u0394T is the change in temperature.\n\nIn this case, the heat transfer is the amount of heat delivered indoors (15,000 J) and the temperature difference is 27\u00b0C - 7\u00b0C = 20\u00b0C. The specific heat capacity of water is approximately 4.18 J/g \\* \u00b0C.\n\nSo, the mass of the water is m = Q / c \\* \u0394T = 15,000 J / 4.18 J/g \\* \u00b0C \\* 20\u00b0C = 111.7 kg.\n\nThe work required to pump the heat is the heat transfer divided by the efficiency of the heat pump, which is assumed to be 100%. So, the work required is W = Q / (100%) = 15,000 J / 100% = 15,000 J.\n\nTherefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately 2,000 J.",
