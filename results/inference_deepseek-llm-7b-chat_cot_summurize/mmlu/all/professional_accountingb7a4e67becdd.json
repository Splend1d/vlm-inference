Cobb uses the periodic inventory method. Purchases for the month were as follows: Date No. of Units Unit cost Total Cost May 4 20 $5.80 $116.00 May 17 80 $5.50 $440.00 Cobb sold 10 units on May 14 for $120. What is Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold for May?\n\nA. $60.20\nB. $62.10\nC. $62.50\nD. 65\n\nassistant:To calculate Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold (WACOS), we need to consider the units of inventory and the cost of those units at the beginning and end of the month. We also need to take into account the units purchased and the cost of those units, as well as the units sold and the cost of those units.\n\n1. At the beginning of the month, Cobb had 200 units in inventory, with a total cost of $1250.\n2. Cobb purchased 20 units on May 4 for $5.80 each, and 80 units on May 17 for $5.50 each.\n3. Cobb sold 10 units on May 14 for $120 each.\n\nTo calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold, we need to consider the units of inventory at the beginning and end of the month, as well as the cost of those units. We also need to take into account the units purchased and the cost of those units, as well as the units sold and the cost of those units.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold for the units sold on May 14:\n10 units sold for $120 each:\n10 * $120 = $1,200\n\nNext, let's calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold for the units purchased on May 17:\n80 units purchased for $5.50 each:\n80 * $5.50 = $440\n\nNow, let's calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold for the units sold on May 14 and the units purchased on May 17:\n$1,200 (units sold on May 14) + $440 (units purchased on May 17) = $1,640\n\nNow, let's calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold for the units at the beginning and end of the month:\n200 units at the beginning with a total cost of $1,250:\n200 * $1250 = $250,000\n\n200 units at the end with a total cost of $1,250:\n200 * $1250 = $250,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold for the units at the beginning and end of the month:\n$250,000 (units at the beginning) + $250,000 (units at the end) = $500,000\n\nFinally, let's calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold for the month:\n$1,640 (units sold and purchased) / $500,000 (total units) = 0.0328\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:\n0.0328 * 100 = 3.28%\n\nTherefore, Cobb's WACOS for May is 3.28%.\n\nThe closest answer to this percentage is D. 65.",
