The Christian Science movement.\n\nassistant:Dorothea Dix's testimony to the Massachusetts legislature reflects the influence of the Second Great Awakening. The Second Great Awakening was a religious revival that took place in the United States in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It focused on individual piety and the need for social reform, and it led to the establishment of numerous charitable organizations, including those for the care of the mentally ill and the poor. Dix's testimony highlights the deplorable conditions in which many mentally ill individuals were being held, and her advocacy for reform was in line with the values of the Second Great Awakening.",
