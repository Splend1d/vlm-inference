In this case, the key terms are \"Lukianoff and Haidt,\" \"trigger warnings,\" and \"pathological thinking.\" Next, I will search my knowledge base for relevant information about these key terms and concepts.\n\nLukianoff and Haidt are authors who have written extensively about political correctness and the impact of microaggressions on free speech. Trigger warnings are a topic that they have discussed in their work. Their argument is that trigger warnings can create a culture of fear and censorship, and that they involve certain types of pathological thinking.\n\nNow that I have this information, I can answer the user's question. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that trigger warnings involve dichotomous thinking. This is because they believe that trigger warnings oversimplify complex issues and encourage people to view the world in black-and-white terms, with things being either \"safe\" or \"unsafe.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. dichotomous thinking",
