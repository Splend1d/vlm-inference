We can use this value to find the proportionality constant between Mr and r3:\n\n100 = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kBT\n\nNow, we can solve for the proportionality constant and use it to find the rotational correlation time for a small protein with Mr = 8400.\n\nr3 = (3kBT) / (4\u03c0\u03b7100)\n\nr = (3kBT) / (4\u03c0\u03b7100) ^ (1/3)\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kBT\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7((3kBT) / (4\u03c0\u03b7100))^(2/3) / 3kBT\n\n\u03c4c = (3kBT) / (4\u03c0\u03b7100)^(1/3)\n\n\u03c4c = (3kBT) / (4\u03c0(100)^(1/3))\n\n\u03c4c = (3kBT) / (4\u03c0(3.0)^(1/3))\n\n\u03c4c \u2248 (3kBT) / (4\u03c0(1.8)^(1/3))\n\n\u03c4c \u2248 14.4 ns\n\nSince the answer is a little bit longer than 42 ns, the closest option is B. 42 ns.",
