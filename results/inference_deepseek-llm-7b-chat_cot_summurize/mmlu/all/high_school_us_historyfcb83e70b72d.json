The success of abolitionists to sway majority public opinion\n\nassistant:This excerpt from Frederick Douglass is an example of Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery. Douglass describes how the state and church governments, as well as the federal government, are all working together to support and defend slavery. This shows that the South was able to exert a significant amount of influence over the federal government at the time, and that the institution of slavery was being actively defended and supported by powerful forces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery.",
