If both dice show 6, then the player wins $20; otherwise the player loses the game. It costs $2.00 to play the game. What is the expected gain or loss per game?\n\nA. The player will gain about $0.55.\nB. The player will gain about $1.44.\nC. The player will lose about $0.55.\nD. The player will lose about $1.44.\n\nassistant:To calculate the expected gain or loss per game, we can use the following formula:\n\nExpected gain or loss = (Probability of winning) \\* (Amount won) + (Probability of losing) \\* (Amount lost) - (Cost to play the game)\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities of each possible outcome:\n\n1. Both dice show a 6: This is the only winning outcome. The probability of this happening is 1/6 \\* 1/6 = 1/36.\n2. One die shows a 6 and the other does not: There are 5 possibilities for this outcome, with each one having a probability of 1/6. So the total probability of this outcome is 5/6.\n\nNow let's calculate the amounts won and lost for each outcome:\n\n1. Both dice show a 6: The player wins $20.\n2. One die shows a 6 and the other does not: The player loses the game.\n\nThe cost to play the game is $2.00.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nExpected gain or loss = (1/36) \\* $20 + (5/6) \\* (-$20) - $2 = -$0.55\n\nSo the expected gain or loss per game is about -$0.55, which corresponds to option C. The player will lose about $0.55 per game.",
