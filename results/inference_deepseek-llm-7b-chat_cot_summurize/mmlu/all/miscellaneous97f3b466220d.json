Vehicular\nC. Gravitational\nD. Torsal\n\nassistant:The force that causes an ice cream cone to fly off of a spinning merry-go-round is centrifugal force. Centrifugal force is a force that seems to resist changes in the direction of motion, and it acts outward from the center of rotation. In the case of a spinning merry-go-round, the centrifugal force causes the ice cream cone to be thrown off the spinning platform.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
