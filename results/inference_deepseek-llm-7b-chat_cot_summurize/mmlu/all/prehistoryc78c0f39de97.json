This concept emerged from the analysis of prehistoric cave paintings, particularly those in France's Chauvet Cave, which depicted scenes of hunting, gathering, and daily life. It is believed that these paintings were created by older women, who were responsible for caring for the younger generation and passing on their knowledge and experiences through cave art. The \"grandmother effect\" reflects the crucial role that older women played in ensuring the survival and well-being of their communities, and the impact that their presence had on child mortality rates.\n\nA. is incorrect because the \"grandmother effect\" does not refer to the premature aging of many Paleolithic women.\nB. is incorrect because the \"grandmother effect\" does not refer to a shift in cave paintings that took place as older women began to express themselves.\nD. is incorrect because the \"grandmother effect\" does not relate to feminist archaeologists questioning male prejudice in the field.",
