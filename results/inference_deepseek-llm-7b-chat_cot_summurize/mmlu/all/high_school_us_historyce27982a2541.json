Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n\nassistant:The passage describes the changing role of women in society due to economic necessity, specifically the shift from traditional female roles to more active participation in the workforce and public life. This development would most likely have been supported by the National Woman Suffrage Association (C), as it advocated for women's rights and opportunities in education, employment, and public life.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan (A) was a white supremacist organization that sought to maintain white dominance and restrict the rights of African Americans and other minorities. The American Temperance Union (B) was an organization focused on promoting abstinence from alcohol, which is not directly related to the issue of women's rights and economic necessity. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (D) was an organization that advocated for civil rights and social justice, but its focus was on racial equality, not women's rights.\n\nTherefore, the National Woman Suffrage Association would have most likely supported the scenario described in the passage.",
