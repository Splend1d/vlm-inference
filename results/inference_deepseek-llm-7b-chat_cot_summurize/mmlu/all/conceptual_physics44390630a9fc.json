This is because the energy required to convert water from its liquid state to its vapor state (i.e., boiling) comes from the heat being added to the water. During this process, the water molecules gain energy and move faster, eventually reaching the boiling point and transforming into steam. This is an example of energy being released by the water as it undergoes a phase change.",
