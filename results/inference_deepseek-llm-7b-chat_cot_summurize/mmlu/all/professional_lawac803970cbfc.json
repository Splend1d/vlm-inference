Under the applicable statute of limitations, a suit to collect on the promissory note had to have been filed by September 30 of last year. On June 1 of this year, the creditor received a letter from the debtor stating, \"I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you. \" However, the debtor failed to make the payment on July 1. If, on August 1, the creditor brings suit against the debtor and the debtor asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and refuses to pay the creditor anything, which of the following accurately states the creditor's legal rights against the debtor?\n\nA. On June 1 the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nB. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nC. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for$12,000.\nD. The creditor is not entitled to anything, on either June 1 or on July 1.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. On June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only. This is because the debtor promised to pay $5,000 on July 1, but failed to do so. However, the creditor did not bring the suit before September 30 of the previous year, which means the statute of limitations has expired. Therefore, the debtor can assert the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and refuse to pay the creditor anything.",
