Such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings\nB. Such abduction gives rise to the abductor's liability but does not lead to a stay of proceedings\nC. The stay of proceedings under such circumstances would prevent the administration of justice in respect of international criminals\nD. The courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings.\n\nExtra-territorial abduction refers to the abduction of a person across national borders. This can lead to a situation where the English courts refuse to exercise jurisdiction over the case, as the abduction has taken place outside of their jurisdiction. This is referred to as the \"refusal of otherwise lawful jurisdiction\".\n\nThe stay of proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction is not due to the abduction giving rise to the abductor's liability, as this would imply that the abductor would be held accountable for the actions taken. The stay of proceedings is instead due to the abuse of process that has occurred, as the abduction has disrupted the normal legal proceedings in the English courts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings.",
