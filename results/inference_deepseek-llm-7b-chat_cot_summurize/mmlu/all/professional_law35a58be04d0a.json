The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity. This would mean that the state corporation, which is acting under the authority of a state statute, has the right to take the timber company's land for a public purpose, such as a state recreational area and state game lands. This would allow the state court to order possession of the land surrendered to the corporation without requiring compensation to be paid prior to the condemnation.",
