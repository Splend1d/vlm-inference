The passage provided discusses the struggles of the people and the corruption in the political system, with the Populist Party seeking to restore the government to the hands of the \"plain people\" and establish a more perfect union based on the National Constitution. The \"free silver\" campaign refers to the idea of increasing the money supply by supporting the use of silver as a currency alongside gold, which would help farmers by making it easier for them to pay off their debts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention New England businessmen as supporters of the \"free silver\" campaign.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not mention Southern women as supporters of the \"free silver\" campaign.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not mention bankers as supporters of the \"free silver\" campaign.",
