How many degrees of freedom does this test have?\n\nA. 6\nB. 8\nC. 10\nD. 11\n\nassistant:To determine the degrees of freedom in a chi-squared test of independence, we need to subtract the number of rows and columns from the total number of cells.\n\nIn a 3 \u00d7 4 contingency table, there are 12 cells. So, the total number of cells is 12.\n\nThe number of rows is 3, and the number of columns is 4. Therefore, the degrees of freedom for the chi-squared test of independence are:\n\n12 - 3 - 4 = 5\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. The test has 10 degrees of freedom.",
