The officer intended to frighten the man by firing shots in his direction, but the outcome was unintended and resulted in the man's death. This falls under the category of involuntary manslaughter, which occurs when a person causes the death of another through criminal negligence or an unlawful act, but without a specific intent to cause harm. Assault with a deadly weapon and voluntary manslaughter would require a more specific intent to cause harm or provoke a violent response. Murder would require premeditation or deliberate intent to cause harm. Therefore, the police officer's actions fit the charge of involuntary manslaughter.",
