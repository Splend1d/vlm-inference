If the product is used by 100 customers, what is its availability?\n\nA. 80%\nB. 90%\nC. 98%\nD. 99.80%\n\nassistant:To find the availability of the product, we can use the following formula:\n\nAvailability = (Mean time between failures) x (Mean time to repair) / (Mean time between failures + Mean time to repair)\n\nAvailability = (10,000 hours) x (20 hours) / (10,000 hours + 20 hours)\n\nAvailability = 200,000 hours / 10,020 hours\n\nAvailability = 19.87%\n\nTherefore, the availability of the product is approximately 19.87%, which is not listed in the given options.",
