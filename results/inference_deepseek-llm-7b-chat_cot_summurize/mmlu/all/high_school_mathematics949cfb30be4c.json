Given that one of the integers is 48, what is the other integer?\n\nA. 1\nB. 120\nC. 20\nD. 12\n\nassistant:Let the other integer be x. We are given that the least common multiple (LCM) is 240, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) is 24. We can write the following equations:\n\nx \ufffd 48 = LCM \ufffd 24\nx = LCM * 24\n\nThe LCM is 240, so we can substitute that in:\n\nx = 240 * 24\n\nNow we can calculate the value of x:\n\nx = 5760\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices provided. We made an error in our calculations. Let's try again.\n\nWe can rewrite the equations as:\n\nx = 240 * 24 / 48\nx = 240 * 3\nx = 720\n\nNow, we can check if this value of x is one of the answer choices:\n\n720 is not one of the answer choices provided.
