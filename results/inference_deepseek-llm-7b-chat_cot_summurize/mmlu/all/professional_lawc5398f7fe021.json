This is because the classmate agreed to settle the dispute with words, not with the use of weapons such as brass knuckles. Even though the outcome of the fight would have been the same, the consent was still violated due to the use of the brass knuckles. The other options are not valid because they either do not focus on the consent issue, or they do not accurately describe the situation. The graduate student's insults did not provoke the use of excessive force, and the classmate was not acting in self-defense as the fight was instigated by the graduate student.",
