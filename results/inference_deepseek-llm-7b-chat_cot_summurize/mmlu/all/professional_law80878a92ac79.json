The investor gave a mortgage for $80,000, which was also recorded. The bank gave a mortgage for $50,000, which was also recorded.\n\nIn a foreclosure proceeding, the property was sold for $160,000. The recording statute stated that if an instrument affecting title is not recorded, it is void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. However, since the friend's mortgage was recorded, it is valid.\n\nThe total amount owed to the friend is $100,000, which is greater than the amount owed to the investor ($80,000) and the bank ($50,000). Therefore, the friend is entitled to receive the entire amount that was sold at the foreclosure, which is $160,000. \n\nHowever, since the friend received a $100,000 mortgage from the homeowner, the friend is only entitled to $60,000 ($160,000 - $100,000) from the foreclosure sale.
