Negotiations to obtain a wage floor\nB. Restrictive membership policies\nC. Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources\nD. Featherbedding or make-work rules\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will first analyze each option and determine which method is not among the methods unions use to increase wages.\n\nA. Negotiations to obtain a wage floor - Unions often negotiate with employers to establish a minimum wage or wage floor, which can help increase wages for union members.\n\nB. Restrictive membership policies - Unions often have strict membership requirements to ensure that only workers who support the union's goals and values are part of the union. This can help unions negotiate stronger contracts and benefits for their members.\n\nC. Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources - This method is not directly related to increasing wages for union members. Unions may focus on increasing wages by negotiating with employers rather than reducing the prices of substitute resources.\n\nD. Featherbedding or make-work rules - These are tactics used by unions to increase wages by ensuring that all workers on a job site are represented by the union and receive union wages, even if they are not directly involved in the work being performed.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the method that is not among the methods unions use to increase wages.",
