In other words, it can change its output based on the input it receives.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer is C. synchros. Synchros are a type of variable displacement transducer that are used to control the speed and direction of rotating machinery. They work by varying the amount of force applied to the machinery, which in turn changes the speed and direction of the rotation.\n\nOption A, a tachometer, is a device that measures the speed of an engine or other rotating machinery. It does not vary its displacement or distance traveled based on input.\n\nOption B, a potentiometer, is a device that measures the amount of electrical resistance in a circuit. It does not vary its displacement or distance traveled based on input.\n\nOption D, none of the above, is incorrect because synchros are a type of variable displacement transducer.",
