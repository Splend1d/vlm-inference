Carter had to deal with the Soviet military aggression in Afghanistan and the terrorist acts against Americans in Iran, while Roosevelt had to deal with the Great Depression and the rise of fascism in Europe. Both leaders called upon the best of their nation's abilities and resources to meet these challenges and did not fail.",
