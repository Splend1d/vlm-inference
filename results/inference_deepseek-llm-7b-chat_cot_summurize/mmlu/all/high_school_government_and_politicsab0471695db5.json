In the context of the president's cabinet, the term is used to describe a cabinet member who has become too closely aligned with the interests of special interest groups or lobbying organizations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because \"ceding control\" does not necessarily mean that the cabinet member has gone native. It could simply mean that they are delegating responsibilities.\n\nOption C is incorrect because prioritizing the president's agenda does not necessarily mean that the cabinet member has gone native. It could simply mean that they are doing their job.\n\nOption D is incorrect because accepting bribes or expensive favors does not necessarily mean that the cabinet member has gone native. It could simply mean that they are corrupt.",
