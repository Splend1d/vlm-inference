Here, D refers to the number of dimensions in the space being optimized, and N refers to the number of data points. This is because the algorithm requires computing the gradient at each point and making a small step in that direction, both of which have a linear complexity in the number of dimensions and data points. The number of iterations is also an important factor, but it is not the primary determinant of the overall complexity. Therefore, the answer is B. linear in N.",
