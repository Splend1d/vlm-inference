The relationship between the magnetization and the applied magnetic field is non-linear, which means that as the magnetic field increases, the magnetization increases but at a decreasing rate. This non-linear relationship is a characteristic of ferromagnetic materials.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the relationship between the magnetization and the applied magnetic field is non-sinusoidal.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the relationship between the magnetization and the applied magnetic field is non-linear, not linear.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the relationship between the magnetization and the applied magnetic field is not parabolic.",
