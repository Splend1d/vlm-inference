N-3 fatty acids\n\nThe best evidence exists for the role of N-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, in the prevention of age-related cognitive decline. These fatty acids are found in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines, as well as in flaxseed and chia seeds. N-3 fatty acids have been shown to improve brain function, reduce inflammation, and protect against neurodegeneration. Phytochemicals and N-6 fatty acids are also important for overall health, but the evidence for their role in preventing cognitive decline is not as strong as that for N-3 fatty acids. Long chain saturated fats, on the other hand, have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and may contribute to cognitive decline.",
