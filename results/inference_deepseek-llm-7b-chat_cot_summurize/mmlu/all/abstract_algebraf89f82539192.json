Statement 2 | If B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B_1| = |B_2|.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: In a finite dimensional vector space every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.\nThis statement is true. In a finite-dimensional vector space, a linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to a basis. A linearly independent set of vectors is a set of vectors that when combined with the zero vector, do not produce a zero vector. If this set of vectors can be extended to a basis, it means that the set of vectors is sufficient to represent any vector in the vector space.\n\nStatement 2: If B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B_1| = |B_2|.\nThis statement is false. The number of vectors in a basis does not need to be the same for two different bases of the same vector space. A basis is a minimal set of vectors that can be used to represent any vector in the vector space. Therefore, the number of vectors in a basis can vary depending on the set of vectors used to form the basis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B. False, False.",
