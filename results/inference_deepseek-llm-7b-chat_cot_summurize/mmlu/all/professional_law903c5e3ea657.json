Granted, because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.\nD. Granted, because the arrest was illegal and therefore the evidence is considered to be fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.\n\nUnder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, an officer must have probable cause to search an individual or their property. In this case, the officer had probable cause to arrest Stan after seeing him run out of the liquor store and hear the alarm and breaking glass. Therefore, the officer had the right to search the trunk of the car as part of the arrest.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, while the officer did have probable cause to search the trunk, the fact that the officer had probable cause does not necessarily mean that the search was constitutional.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant or probable cause for a search incident to a valid arrest.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the arrest was not illegal. The officer had probable cause to arrest Stan, and the arrest was not a false arrest or illegal stop.",
