Prions are misfolded proteins that can cause diseases such as mad cow disease, and are not related to the movement of genetic material. Cistrons are the functional units of heredity in bacteria and archaea, and are also not capable of inserting themselves into an existing genome.\n\nTransposons, on the other hand, are a type of mobile genetic element that are capable of inserting themselves into an existing genome. They are also known as jumping genes because of their ability to move around within the genome. There are several types of transposons, including DNA transposons, retrotransposons, and LTR retrotransposons.",
