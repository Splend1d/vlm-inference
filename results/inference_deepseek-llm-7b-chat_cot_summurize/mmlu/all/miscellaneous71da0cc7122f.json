A hooking penalty occurs when a player grabs an opponent's stick, arm, or body with their stick. A charging penalty occurs when a player aggressively charges towards an opponent. A carving penalty is not a recognized penalty in ice hockey, and a butt-ending penalty occurs when a player uses their butt to make contact with an opponent. Therefore, \"carving\" is the correct answer.",
