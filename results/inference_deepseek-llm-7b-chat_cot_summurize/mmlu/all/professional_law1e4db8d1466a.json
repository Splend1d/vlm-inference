A citrus grower owns the orange grove in fee simple and maintains both his dwelling house and the business he operates on the orange grove. He has a right of way, granted by a written agreement, across the grapefruit grove for crossing the grapefruit grove on foot, by bicycle, or automobile. A farmer is the owner of the grapefruit grove. The citrus grower's property interest in the use of his right of way across the grapefruit grove may best be described as a (an)\n\nA. license.\nB. easement in gross.\nC. easement appurtenant.\nD. prescriptive easement.\n\nassistant:A right of way is a type of easement, which is a legal right to use someone else's property for a specific purpose. There are two types of easements: appurtenant and in gross. An appurtenant easement runs with the land, meaning that it is attached to the property and benefits both the dominant estate (the property the easement is on) and the servient estate (the property the easement runs through). An in gross easement does not run with the land and only benefits the dominant estate.\n\nIn this case, the citrus grower's right of way across the grapefruit grove is an easement appurtenant because it benefits both the orange grove and the grapefruit grove. Therefore, the answer is C. easement appurtenant.",
