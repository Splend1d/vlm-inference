The ordinance prohibits picketing before or about the residence of an individual, but it does not specify what type of behavior is considered picketing. This vagueness allows for arbitrary enforcement and violates the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Additionally, the ordinance is overbroad because it prohibits picketing in front of private residences, which may include the principal's house. This could potentially prohibit peaceful protestors from exercising their First Amendment rights.",
