Both of these.\nD. Neither of these.\n\nassistant:B. relativistic speeds.\n\nThe Relativity equations for time, length, and momentum hold true for relativistic speeds. These equations, developed by Albert Einstein in his theory of special relativity, describe how time, length, and momentum are affected by an object's velocity relative to an observer. At everyday low speeds, these effects are negligible compared to the relativistic speeds.",
