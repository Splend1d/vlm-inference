What is the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles if it is known that it has been driven over 80,000 miles? Assume a normal distribution of miles per year among cabs.\n\nA. 0.06\nB. 0.34\nC. 0.66\nD. 0.94\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula to find the z-score for the given values of mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3):\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value of interest (100,000 miles), \u03bc is the mean (75,000 miles), and \u03c3 is the standard deviation (12,000 miles).\n\nz = (100,000 - 75,000) / 12,000\nz = 25,000 / 12,000\nz = 2.0833\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles. We can do this using the z-score and the standard normal distribution table or a calculator.\n\nThe z-score 2.0833 corresponds to a probability of 0.0009 or 0.009%. However, we are looking for the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. To find this probability, we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) = 1 - P(X > 100,000 | X > 80,000)\n\nWe don't have the actual probabilities for cabs driven over 80,000 miles, so we can use the normal distribution to approximate the probabilities. Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the z-score for 100,000 miles is approximately 3.1283.\n\nP(X > 100,000 | X > 80,000) = P(Z > 3.1283)\nP(Z > 3.1283) = 1 - P(Z < 3.1283)\nP(Z < 3.1283) = P(Z \u2264 3.1283) = 0.8413\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles:\n\nP(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) = 1 - P(Z > 3.1283) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nHowever, this is the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, not the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. To find this probability, we can multiply the result by the probability that a cab has been driven over 80,000 miles:\n\nP(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) * P(X > 80,000)\n\nWe don't have the exact probabilities for cabs driven over 80,000 miles, but we can use the standard deviation and mean values to approximate the probability using a standard normal distribution table or calculator. The z-score for 80,000 miles is approximately -0.8819.\n\nP(X > 80,000) = P(Z < -0.8819) = 0.4898\n\nNow, we can multiply the probabilities to find the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles:\n\nP(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) * P(X > 80,000) = 0.1587 * 0.4898 \u2248 0.0774\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0.34.",
