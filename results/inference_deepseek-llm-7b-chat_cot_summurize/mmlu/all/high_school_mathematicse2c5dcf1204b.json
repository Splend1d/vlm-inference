During November, it did not sell, and the merchant marked it down 20 percent. Then in December, she marked it down an additional 10 percent. What would a Christmas shopper in December pay for the coat in dollars?\n\nA. $227.50\nB. $234.00\nC. $286.00\nD. $290.00\n\nassistant:To find the price of the coat in December, we can first calculate the price after the first markdown in November and then the price after the second markdown in December.\n\n1. Markdown in November: 20% off the original price of $325.00\nMarkdown amount = 0.20 * $325.00 = $65.00\nNew price in November = $325.00 - $65.00 = $260.00\n\n2. Markdown in December: 10% off the price in November\nMarkdown amount = 0.10 * $260.00 = $26.00\nNew price in December = $260.00 - $26.00 = $234.00\n\nThe Christmas shopper in December would pay $234.00 for the coat.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $234.00.",
