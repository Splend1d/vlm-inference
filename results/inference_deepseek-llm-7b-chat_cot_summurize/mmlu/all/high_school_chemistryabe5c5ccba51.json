Add 67.7 mL of water to the flask, and then add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid.\n\nassistant:To make up 100 mL of 4.0 M sulfuric acid using the stock solution and water, you should perform the following steps:\n\n1. Weigh the flask and the stopper.\n2. Add 33.3 mL of water to the flask.\n3. Add 33.3 mL of the 12.0 M sulfuric acid to the flask.\n4. Record the weight of the flask and the stopper after the mixture is fully dissolved.\n5. Calculate the volume of the mixture by subtracting the weight of the flask and the stopper before the mixture was added and the weight of the flask and the stopper after the mixture was fully dissolved.\n6. Calculate the concentration of the mixture by dividing the volume of the mixture by the total volume of the solution.\n\nUsing the provided answer choices, the correct procedure is:\n\nB. Add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\nThis will result in a mixture with a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 4.0 M.",
