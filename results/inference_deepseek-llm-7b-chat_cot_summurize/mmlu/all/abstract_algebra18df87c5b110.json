False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.\n\nThis statement is false. A homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if its kernel is trivial (consists only of the identity element). However, the kernel consisting of only the identity element alone does not necessarily mean that the homomorphism is one-to-one.\n\nStatement 2: The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.\n\nThis statement is also false. The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism cannot have fewer than 6 elements. A homomorphism is a function that maps one group to another, and in general, the image of a group under a homomorphism will have the same number of elements as the kernel of the homomorphism (the set of all elements that are mapped to the identity element). Since the kernel of a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements to another group must contain at least 6 elements (by Lagrange's theorem), the image of the group must also have at least 6 elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
