In the passage, President Harry S. Truman talks about the seeds of totalitarian regimes being nurtured by misery and want, and how they spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. He also mentions that these regimes reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. Truman then states that we must keep that hope alive, and that great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. He is confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\n\nThe policy of containment was a foreign policy pursued by the United States during the Cold War, aimed at preventing the spread of communism to other countries. This policy was based on the idea of containing the spread of communism within certain borders, rather than directly confronting it. The passage highlights the importance of addressing the conditions that give rise to totalitarian regimes, such as poverty and want, and the need to keep hope alive for a better life. This aligns with the policy of containment, which emphasized the importance of preventing the spread of communism and addressing the underlying conditions that give rise to it.\n\nTherefore, the passage above can best be seen as providing a rationale for the policy of containment.",
