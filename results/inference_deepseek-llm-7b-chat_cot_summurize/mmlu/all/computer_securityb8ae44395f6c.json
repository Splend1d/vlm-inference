True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:The answer is D. False, True.\n\nTLS (Transport Layer Security) protects against both of the attacks mentioned. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier is a replay attack, which TLS does protect against. An attacker impersonating the server is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, which TLS also protects against. In a MITM attack, the attacker intercepts and modifies communication between two parties, pretending to be one of them. The Diffie-Hellman exchange and the server certificate verification help prevent MITM attacks.",
