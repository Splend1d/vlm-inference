The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonableperiod of time.\n\nassistant:D. The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time.\n\nThe photographer's injury was a temporary impediment that prevented him from fulfilling his contractual obligations. Under the doctrine of impracticability, a party to a contract may be excused from performance if an unforeseen event renders performance impracticable or impossible. In this case, the photographer's injury was an unforeseen event that made it impossible for him to fulfill his part of the contract on time. This would excuse his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time, which in this case was the time it took for him to recover from his injury and complete the photos. The other options are not applicable in this situation. The photographs, if subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory is subjective and does not provide a valid defense. The photographs, if objectively viewed, were not satisfactory is also subjective and does not provide a valid defense. The photographs were not delivered on time is a breach of contract, but it does not provide a valid defense as the photographer was unable to fulfill his obligations due to the injury.",
