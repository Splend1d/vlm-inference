The marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional citizens is greater than zero.\n\nThe pure public good is a type of good that is non-excludable and non-rival. This means that it is impossible to prevent people from consuming the good, and consuming the good does not reduce the availability of the good for others. The marginal cost of providing an additional unit of a public good to additional citizens is zero, as it does not require any additional resources to produce. Therefore, option A is not true for the pure public good.",
