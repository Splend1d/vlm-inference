In how many ways can he choose 4 marbles, if exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue?\n\nA. 252\nB. 276\nC. 441\nD. 84\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations. First, we need to choose one marble that is either red, green, or blue. There are 3 ways to do this (since there are 3 marbles of each color).\n\nNext, we need to choose 3 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. This can be done in 9P3 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles with exactly one red, green, or blue marble is 3P1 * 9P3 = 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 252.",
