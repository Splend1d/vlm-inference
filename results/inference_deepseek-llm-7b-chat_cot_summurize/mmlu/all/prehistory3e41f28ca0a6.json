Olmec traders, who were impressed with its grandeur.\n\nassistant:The name Teotihuac\u00e1n was given to the city by the Aztecs, who continued to make pilgrimages there long after its collapse. The Aztecs, who lived in central Mexico in the post-Teotihuac\u00e1n period, called the city Teotihuac\u00e1n, meaning \"the place where the gods were created or born.\" This name was passed down to the Aztec descendants, the Mexica, who later founded the Aztec Empire. Teotihuac\u00e1n was an important pilgrimage site for the Aztecs, who believed that the gods had lived there in ancient times.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Spanish invaders did not give the name Teotihuac\u00e1n to the city. They referred to it as \"the place of the water\" because they found water sources there.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no evidence that the city's first king named it after his favorite deity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Olmec traders, who lived in what is now southeastern Mexico, did not give the name Teotihuac\u00e1n to the city. They did not have any contact with the Teotihuac\u00e1n culture.",
