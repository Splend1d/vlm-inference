Foraging refers to the activity of searching for and collecting food, plants, and other resources from the environment. This method of subsistence has been practiced by many human societies throughout history, and continues to be practiced by some modern-day indigenous groups. While agriculture, which involves cultivating plants for food, has become more widespread in recent centuries, it is important to remember that foraging was the primary means of obtaining food for most of human history.",
