If he left home for more than five minutes, for how many minutes was he away?\n\nA. 36\nB. 40\nC. 38\nD. 43\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the time when the angle formed by the hands of the clock is 110 degrees.\n\nLet's denote the time John left home as t (in hours) and the time he returned as t + 1 (in hours).\n\nThe angle formed by the hands of the clock can be calculated using the formula:\n\nangle = (11/12) * (360 degrees) * (t * (t + 1) / 2)\n\nWe are given that the angle is 110 degrees when John left home and when he returned, so we have:\n\n110 = (11/12) * (360 degrees) * (t * (t + 1) / 2)\n\nLet's simplify the equation:\n\n(11/12) * (360 degrees) * (t * (t + 1) / 2) = 110\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\n(11/12) * (360 degrees) * t * (t + 1) / 2 = 110\n\n(11/12) * (360 degrees) * t * (t + 1) = 110 * 12\n\n(11/12) * (360 degrees) * t * (t + 1) = 1320\n\nt * (t + 1) = 120\n\nNow, we can find the possible values of t and the corresponding values of (t + 1):\n\nt = 0, (t + 1) = 1\nt = 1, (t + 1) = 2\nt = 2, (t + 1) = 3\nt = 3, (t + 1) = 4\nt = 4, (t + 1) = 5\nt = 5, (t + 1) = 6\nt = 6, (t + 1) = 7\nt = 7, (t + 1) = 8\nt = 8, (t + 1) = 9\nt = 9, (t + 1) = 10\nt = 10, (t + 1) = 11\nt = 11, (t + 1) = 12\n\nNone of these values satisfies the condition that John left home for more than five minutes, so there is no solution for t. Therefore, we cannot determine how many minutes John was away.",
