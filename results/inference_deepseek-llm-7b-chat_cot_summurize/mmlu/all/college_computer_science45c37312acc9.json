I and II\n\nassistant:To determine which of the given statements must be true for a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E), let's analyze each one:\n\nI. \u03a3_{v\u2208V} degree(v) is even.\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph. Since the graph is connected, there must be at least one edge between every pair of vertices. Therefore, the sum of the degrees of all vertices must be even, as it is at least twice the number of edges (which is an even number).\n\nII. |E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1\nThe number of edges in a connected graph is at least one more than the number of vertices minus one. This is because, in a connected graph, there must be at least one edge between every pair of vertices.\n\nIII. G has at least one vertex with degree 1.\nEvery vertex in a connected graph must have a degree greater than or equal to one, as it must be connected to at least one other vertex.\n\nBased on the analysis above, all three statements are true for a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E). Therefore, the correct answer is D. I and II.",
