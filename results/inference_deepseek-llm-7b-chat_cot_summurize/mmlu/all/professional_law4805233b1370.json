Several generations of the law student's family had attended this prestigious law school. One week before the start of the fall term, at a party to celebrate the law student's acceptance to the school, his father announced to the law student, in the presence of the partygoers, \"Son, it's your obligation to uphold the family tradition for excellence at the school. In this regard, if you promise to study a minimum of five hours a day, I shall pay you $1,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your first year; $2,500 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your second year; and $5,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your third year. \"The most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be that\n\nA. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.\nB. the promise would not be legally binding, since it was non-detrimental.\nC. the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.\nD. the promise constituted a voidable proposal.\n\nassistant:The most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be that the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift. This is because the father's promise is contingent on the law student's performance, and therefore it is not a unconditional gift.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a gift is considered to be conditional if it is made subject to the happening of an uncertain future event, or the performance of a future act by the donee. In this case, the father's promise to pay the law student a certain sum of money is contingent on the law student's performance, which makes it a conditional gift.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, a conditional gift may be unenforceable if it is found to be unconscionable. This means that if the gift is considered to be too one-sided in favor of the donor, it may not be enforceable. In this case, the law student's father has made a significant financial commitment to his son, which may be considered to be unconscionable.\n\nTherefore, while the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" may be considered to be a conditional gift in some jurisdictions, it may not be enforceable if it is found to be unconscionable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.",
