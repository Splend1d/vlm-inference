The author argues that grammar is best taught through plentiful discursive experience, as it exercises judgment and provides language intake. Formal grammar study, on the other hand, has been proven irrelevant. The author also mentions that politics more than pedagogy retards the changing of the curriculum to fit this truth.\n\nTherefore, the author's argument is best represented by option A: \"using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar\". This is because the author emphasizes the importance of experience in teaching grammar, and suggests that formal grammar study is not as effective.",
