This is because euthanasia is a decision that the patient must make, and if they choose to undergo it, they are giving up their autonomy and control over their own life. This can be a difficult decision for some patients, and it can be a burden to have to make such a choice.\n\nA is incorrect because Velleman does not believe that euthanasia burdens patients with having to justify their continued existence.\nC is incorrect because Velleman does not believe that euthanasia eliminates patients' opportunities for self-determination.\nD is incorrect because Velleman does not believe that euthanasia tempts patients to undergo a painful procedure.",
