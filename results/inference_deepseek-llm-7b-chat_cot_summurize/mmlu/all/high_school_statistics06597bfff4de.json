The first quartile of salaries is $48,815. What is the standard deviation?\n\nA. $6,984 \nB. $10,356 \nC. $10,476 \nD. $13,968\n\nassistant:We can find the standard deviation using the formula:\n\nStandard Deviation = $\\sqrt{\\frac{(Mean - First Quartile)^2 + (Mean - Third Quartile)^2}{2}}$\n\nHere, the mean salary is $55,800, the first quartile salary is $48,815, and the third quartile salary is $53,940. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nStandard Deviation = $\\sqrt{\\frac{(55,800 - 48,815)^2 + (55,800 - 53,940)^2}{2}}$\n\n= $\\sqrt{\\frac{(6,985)^2 + (1,860)^2}{2}}$\n\n= $\\sqrt{65,676 + 3,476}$\n\n= $\\sqrt{69,152}$\n\n= $10,476\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $10,476.",
