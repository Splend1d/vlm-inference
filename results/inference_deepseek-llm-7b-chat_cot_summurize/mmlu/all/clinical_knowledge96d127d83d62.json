However, I can help you answer the question about the minimum time a stretch should be held for.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science, the minimum time a stretch should be held for is around 10-15 seconds. This is because holding a stretch for too long can cause muscle damage or discomfort. However, the optimal length of time for a stretch may vary depending on the individual and the specific stretch being performed. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new stretching routine.",
