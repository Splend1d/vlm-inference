A snubber circuit is used to protect a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) from voltage surges and other electrical disturbances. It is typically designed to be connected in parallel with the SCR. By absorbing some of the energy from these disturbances, the snubber circuit helps to prevent the SCR from being damaged. Option A, B, and D are incorrect because series connection would increase the voltage drop across the SCR, while anti-parallel connection is not a valid configuration for a snubber circuit.",
