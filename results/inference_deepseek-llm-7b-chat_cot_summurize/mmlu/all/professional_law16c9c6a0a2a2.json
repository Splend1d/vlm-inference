This would fall under the inherently dangerous felony requirement, which states that a defendant is only responsible for the direct consequences of their actions, and not for any indirect or foreseeable consequences that may arise from the commission of the underlying felony. This would exclude the defendants from being charged with felony murder, as they did not intend for the victim to suffer a fractured skull or die as a result of the beating.",
