Trace.\n\nIn classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) are presented at different times. The best time between the CS and US to produce classical conditioning is the trace interval, which is the time delay between the CS and US. The trace interval is the time it takes for the CS to become associated with the US and produce a conditioned response.",
