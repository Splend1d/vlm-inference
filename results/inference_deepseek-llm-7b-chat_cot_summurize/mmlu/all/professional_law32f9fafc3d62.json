Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. \u0080\u0083\n\nassistant:The mother is likely to prevail in her action against the doctor for intentional infliction of emotional distress. This is because the doctor's conduct was outrageous and the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. The mother was not contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment, as she had no way of knowing that the doctor would commit such a heinous act. Furthermore, the mother was not a direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness, but she was still the one who suffered severe emotional distress as a result of the doctor's actions. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.",
