So, we need to find the minimum value of $f(1)$ that lies below the line segment with endpoints $(1,5)$ and $(2,9)$.\n\nLet $c$ be the $y$-coordinate of the lowest point on the line segment. Then, the equation of the line segment is $y=c$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly convex, the portion of the graph between $x=1$ and $x=2$ lies below the line segment with endpoints $(1,5)$ and $(2,9)$. Therefore, we have $5 \\leq c \\leq 9$.\n\nSo, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is $c \\leq f(1) \\leq 9$. In interval notation, this is $\\boxed{(9, -inf)}$.",
