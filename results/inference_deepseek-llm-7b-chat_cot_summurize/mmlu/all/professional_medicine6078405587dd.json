She has had a neck mass for more than 10 years. 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis\nB. Graves' disease\nC. Multinodular goiter\nD. Riedel's thyroiditis\n\nassistant:The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Graves' disease. This is a autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland and can cause an overproduction of thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms such as irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and weight loss. The presence of a neck mass and increased and decreased uptake on the 131I scan are also consistent with Graves' disease.",
