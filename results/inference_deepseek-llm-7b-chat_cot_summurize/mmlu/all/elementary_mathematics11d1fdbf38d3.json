What is the minimum rate Sheila can work in order to finish in time?\n\nA. 1 problem per minute\nB. 2 problems per minute\nC. 4 problems per minute\nD. 5 problems per minute\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum rate at which Sheila can work to finish solving 20 arithmetic problems in 5 minutes.\n\nLet's break down the given information:\nNumber of arithmetic problems: 20\nTime limit: 5 minutes\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nNumber of problems * Time per problem = Total time\n20 * (5 / 60) = 5\n\nLet's simplify and solve for the minimum rate:\n20 * (1/12) = 5\n2 = 5\n\nThe equation is not balanced, which means there is no solution that satisfies the given conditions. This means that Sheila cannot solve 20 arithmetic problems in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, there is no correct answer for the given choices.",
