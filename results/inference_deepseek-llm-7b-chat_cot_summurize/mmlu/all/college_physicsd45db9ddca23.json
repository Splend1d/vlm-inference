The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\n\nA. 100 J\nB. 1,000 J\nC. 10,000 J\nD. 1,000,000 J\n\nassistant:To find the heat dissipated by the emergency brakes, we need to calculate the work done on the elevator. The elevator falls a distance of 100 meters starting from rest, so its potential energy at the bottom of the shaft is 1000 kg x 9.81 m/s^2 x 100 m = 98,100 J. When the brakes stop the elevator, this potential energy is converted to heat energy, so the work done on the elevator is equal to the change in its potential energy.\n\nWork = Force x Distance\n\nThe force exerted on the elevator by the emergency brakes is equal to its weight, which is 1000 kg x 9.81 m/s^2 = 98,100 N. The brakes must bring the elevator to a complete stop, so the distance over which the force is applied is the height of the elevator shaft, which is 100 m. Therefore, the work done on the elevator is:\n\nWork = Force x Distance\nW = 98,100 N x 100 m\nW = 9,810,000 J\n\nNow we need to find the change in potential energy:\n\nChange in potential energy = Initial potential energy - Final potential energy\n\nThe initial potential energy is 98,100 J, and the final potential energy is 0 J (since the elevator comes to a complete stop). So, the change in potential energy is:\n\nChange in potential energy = Initial potential energy - Final potential energy\n\u0394U = 98,100 J - 0 J\n\u0394U = 98,100 J\n\nFinally, we can find the heat dissipated by the emergency brakes by multiplying the change in potential energy by the negative sign, since energy is being converted to heat:\n\nHeat = Work x Negative sign\nHeat = -9,810,000 J x -1\nHeat = 9,810,000 J\n\nSo the correct answer is D. 1,000,000 J.",
