The variance of the errors is not constant\nB. The variance of the dependent variable is not constant\nC. The errors are not linearly independent of one another\nD. The errors have non-zero mean\n\nassistant:The term \"heteroscedasticity\" refers to a situation where the variance of the errors in a statistical model is not constant. This means that the influence of each data point on the mean of the model is not equal, leading to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The variance of the errors is not constant.",
