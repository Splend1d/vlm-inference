This means that consequentialist calculations, which focus on the overall consequences of actions, may not take into account the complex relationships and commitments that a person has at different levels of their life. This can lead to a misalignment between a person's actions and their overall goals and values.\n\nConsequentialist calculations are often based on the idea that the end justifies the means, and that the most important thing is the overall consequences of an action. However, this approach may not take into account the various commitments and relationships that a person has, such as commitments to family, friends, and community, or commitments to long-term goals and values. These commitments can be difficult to integrate into consequentialist calculations, which may lead to actions that are not in line with a person's overall goals and values.\n\nTherefore, Hourdequin's criticism of consequentialist calculation is that it can run counter to a person's ability to integrate her commitments at various levels. This suggests that consequentialist calculations may not always be the best way to evaluate actions, as they may not take into account the full range of a person's commitments and relationships.",
