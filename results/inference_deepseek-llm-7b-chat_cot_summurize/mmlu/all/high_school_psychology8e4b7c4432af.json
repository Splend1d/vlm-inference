Ethologists: Ethologists study animal behavior, which is not directly related to the impact of cultural values and ideas on individual thinking.\n\nC. Sociobiologists: Sociobiologists are scientists who study how biology influences social behavior and organization. They have argued that cultural values and ideas are shaped primarily by biology and evolution.\n\nD. Anthropologists: Anthropologists study human societies and cultures, but their work does not specifically focus on how cultural values and ideas shape individual thinking.\n\nBased on my knowledge base, the most accurate answer is C.
