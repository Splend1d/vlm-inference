Stage 0 - do nothing.\n\nassistant:It seems that you are looking for information about the phlebitis scale and the appropriate course of action based on the symptoms you provided. Phlebitis is a condition where the veins in the arm become inflamed and swollen. The symptoms you mentioned - pain at the IV site, erythema (redness), and swelling - are consistent with Stage 2 of the phlebitis scale.\n\nDuring Stage 2, the vein may be tender to the touch and may be red or swollen. It is important to re-site the cannula to a different vein and consider treatment, as leaving the phlebitis untreated can lead to complications such as infection or blood clots.\n\nBased on this information, the appropriate answer to your question is C. Stage 3 - re-site cannula and consider treatment.",
