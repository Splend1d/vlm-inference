As a result, more foreign investors will buy U.S. assets, driving up demand and the value of the dollar. This increase in demand for the dollar will lead to an appreciation in its value relative to other currencies.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. the value of the dollar will tend to depreciate: Interest rate differentials can have a significant impact on exchange rates, but it is not always the case that when interest rates rise in one country relative to another, the value of that country's currency will depreciate. In fact, as explained above, if the interest rates rise in the United States relative to other nations, it could lead to an appreciation of the dollar.\n\nC. exchange rates will be affected but not the value of the dollar: Interest rate differentials can have an impact on exchange rates, but they also affect the value of a currency. The two are closely related, and changes in interest rates can have a significant impact on the value of a currency.\n\nD. the exchange rate will not be affected: As explained above, interest rate differentials can have a significant impact on exchange rates, so it is not accurate to say that the exchange rate will not be affected.",
