The debtor's subsequent letter offering to pay $10,000 from the sale of his house does not create a new obligation to pay the creditor. Therefore, if the creditor sues the debtor for breach of contract, they should not be entitled to recover anything, as the debtor is not obligated to pay the creditor.",
