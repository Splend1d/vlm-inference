The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\nD. The supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nWhen the county government sends each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare, the parents will have more financial incentives to send their children to daycare. This will increase the demand for daycare services in the market. As a result, the market price for daycare services will increase, and daycare providers will raise their prices to reflect the increased demand.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the demand for daycare services will not necessarily fall. Instead, it will increase as more parents are able to afford daycare due to the subsidy.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no guarantee that the supply of daycare will increase. The subsidy may not be enough to attract more providers to enter the market, and existing providers may not increase their supply in response to the subsidy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the supply of daycare will fall. In fact, the subsidy may encourage more parents to send their children to daycare, which could increase the supply of daycare services.",
