An observational study with comparison and randomization\n\nThis study is not an experiment because it does not involve random assignment of participants to different groups or conditions. It is also not an observational study without any manipulation because the exercise intervention is a manipulation. Instead, it can be considered as an observational study with comparison and randomization, as participants are randomly assigned to either exercise or no exercise groups, but the researchers do not manipulate any independent variables.",
