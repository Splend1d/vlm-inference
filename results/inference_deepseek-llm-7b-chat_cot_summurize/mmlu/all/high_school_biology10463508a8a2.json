Apoptosis is not a special type of cell division, but rather a process of programmed cell death that plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological conditions. It is not evidence that it evolved early in the evolution of eukaryotes, as it is also found in some prokaryotes. Additionally, apoptosis does not directly contribute to the development of fingers in embryonic development; rather, it is involved in the removal of abnormal or damaged cells during this process. Finally, although apoptosis helps to prevent an aging and dying cell from damaging neighboring cells, it does not directly prevent aging itself.",
