Yes, because the provision is part of a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.\n\nassistant:The provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds is constitutional.\n\nThe question asks whether the provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds is constitutional. The answer is that the provision is constitutional.\n\nThe United States Constitution grants the Congress the power to appropriate money for the general welfare of the country. This power includes the authority to attach conditions to the appropriations it makes to executive departments. In this case, Congress has the authority to attach a condition to its appropriation of funds for the monument project, which is the requirement that both houses of Congress must adopt a concurrent resolution approving the agency's plans for the monument's location and design. This condition is a reasonable one, as it ensures that the funds are being used for a legitimate purpose and that the monument will be constructed in a way that is consistent with the wishes of Congress.\n\nFurthermore, the provision does not amount to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function, as the President has the authority to sign the bill into law, and the agency has the authority to select the site and construct the monument. The provision merely requires that the plans for the monument's location and design be approved by Congress before the funds can be expended.\n\nIn conclusion, the provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds is constitutional, as Congress has the power to attach conditions to its appropriations and the provision is a reasonable one.",
