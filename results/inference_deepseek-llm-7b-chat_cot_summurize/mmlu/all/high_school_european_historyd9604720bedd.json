Christianity served as a stimulus for exploration as governments and religious authorities sought to spread the faith and counter Islam, and as a justification for the physical and cultural subjugation of indigenous civilizations.\n\nThis is evident in the letter from Hernan Cortez, where he explains that his primary motivations for exploring and colonizing the New World were to protect the lives and property of the indigenous people, teach them about the one true God, and convert them to Christianity. He also mentions that he came to teach them that they must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that he, as the representative of the Holy Roman Emperor, might order them.\n\nOption A is not evident from the document, as there is no mention of mercantilism or the promotion of commercial development. Option B is also not evident, as while gold and spices are mentioned, they are not the primary motivation for Cortez's exploration and colonization efforts. Option C is partially correct, as Cortez did seek great glory and wealth, but this is not the most evident motivation from the document, as his primary focus was on spreading Christianity and converting the indigenous people.",
