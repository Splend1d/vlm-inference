(A) and (B) both in the same way.\nD. none of above.\n\nassistant:A. reluctance of conductor.\n\nThe change in cross-sectional area of a conductor in a magnetic field will affect its reluctance. The reluctance of a conductor is a measure of its opposition to the flow of magnetic flux, and it is directly related to the cross-sectional area of the conductor. Therefore, as the cross-sectional area of the conductor changes, its reluctance will also change.\n\nThe change in cross-sectional area of a conductor in a magnetic field will not affect its resistance in the same way. The resistance of a conductor is a measure of the opposition it offers to the flow of electric current, and it is determined by the material of the conductor and its length, among other factors. Therefore, changing the cross-sectional area of a conductor in a magnetic field will not have a significant impact on its resistance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. reluctance of conductor.",
