His motion to prevent the introduction of his incriminating statements into evidence will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police officer failed to give the defendant his Miranda warnings.\nB. granted, because the police officer's conduct in questioning the defendant immediately after he awoke was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.\nC. denied, because the exchange took place in a non-custodial setting and the question was investigatory in nature.\nD. denied, because the defendant's incriminating statements were voluntary.\n\nassistant:C. denied, because the exchange took place in a non-custodial setting and the question was investigatory in nature.\n\nThe defendant's motion to prevent the introduction of his incriminating statements into evidence will most likely be denied. This is because the exchange between the defendant and the police officer took place in a non-custodial setting (the kiosk at the crossing) and the question was investigatory in nature (asking what happened at the crossing). Under these circumstances, the defendant's incriminating statements would not be admissible in court.\n\nA. granted, because the police officer failed to give the defendant his Miranda warnings, is incorrect. The defendant's statements were not made during an arrest or interrogation, so Miranda warnings were not required.\n\nB. granted, because the police officer's conduct in questioning the defendant immediately after he awoke was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant, is also incorrect. The exchange took place in a non-custodial setting and was investigatory in nature, as mentioned earlier, so this argument does not apply.\n\nD. denied, because the defendant's incriminating statements were voluntary, is not relevant to the motion. The voluntariness of the defendant's statements does not affect whether they were made in a custodial or non-custodial setting or whether they were investigatory in nature.",
