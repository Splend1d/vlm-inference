A corporation who provides cable television services successfully persuaded the state legislature to grant it an exclusive right to install cable television lines in all multiple family dwellings in the state, in exchange for the corporation's promise to freeze cable television rates for the next four years. An owner of several large multifamily apartment buildings in the state brought an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state legislation. The suit claimed that the space used by the corporation when it subsequently installed cable television lines in one of his apartment buildings amounted to a taking without compensation. In this action, the owner will be awarded\n\nA. no relief, because easements for utility lines are presumed to be beneficial to the servient estate.\nB. no relief, because the legislation is merely a regulation of the use of property and not a taking.\nC. no relief, because the corporation is not a government entity.\nD. damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n\nIn this situation, the owner of the apartment buildings is arguing that the state legislation, which grants the cable television corporation an exclusive right to install cable television lines in all multiple family dwellings, amounts to a taking of his property without just compensation. Specifically, he is claiming that the space used by the corporation when it installs cable television lines in one of his apartment buildings amounts to a taking without compensation.\n\nTherefore, the owner would be entitled to damages for the value of the property used by the corporation. This is because the legislation effectively takes away a portion of the owner's property for the use of the cable television corporation, without providing fair compensation for it.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. easements for utility lines are presumed to be beneficial to the servient estate, but this does not necessarily mean that the owner will not be awarded damages if the easement is not used for their benefit.\n\nB. the legislation is not merely a regulation of the use of property, but a taking of it for the benefit of the cable television corporation.\n\nC. the corporation is not a government entity, but the legislation is enacted by the state legislature, which is a government entity.",
