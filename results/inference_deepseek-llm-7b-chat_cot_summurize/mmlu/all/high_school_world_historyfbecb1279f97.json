Prioritization of national liberation over social reform\n\nassistant:The factor that is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage is the prioritization of national liberation over social reform. In the second passage, the speaker mentions that they were poor peasants before the war and that nothing has changed after the war except that they are free and work without fear. This indicates that even though they gained independence, they did not see any improvement in their social conditions, such as access to education. This lack of progress could be attributed to the prioritization of national liberation over social reform. The new elites might have focused more on gaining independence and not on addressing the social issues that the speaker hoped would be achieved. Therefore, the prioritization of national liberation over social reform is the most likely factor that prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage.",
