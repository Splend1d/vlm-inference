This type of association is characterized by a supranational entity, such as the European Union, which has the power to make and enforce laws for its member countries. While nationalism focuses on the importance of national identity and sovereignty, supranationalism involves countries working together beyond their individual national boundaries. Devolution and complementarity are not correct choices as they do not relate to the concept of a voluntary association of countries giving up some measure of sovereignty.",
