He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, \"If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. \" The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be\n\nA. a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.\nB. a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\nC. the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.\nD. a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n\nassistant:The most applicable legal principle in this situation would be D. a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n\nThis principle is applicable because the athlete's promise to assign 10 percent of his first-year earnings to the friend was not a valid assignment of a right that was expected to arise under a contract that was in existence at the time the promise was made. Instead, it was a gratuitous promise, or a promise made without any consideration or expectation of compensation. As a result, the promise was revocable and could be terminated by the athlete's subsequent revocation.\n\nThe other options are not applicable in this situation. Option A refers to a promise to assign a right that has not yet arisen, which is not the case here. Option B states that a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment, which is not relevant to the situation. Option C refers to whether the friend detrimentally relied on the assignment prior to the athlete's attempted revocation, which is not relevant to whether the assignment is enforceable.",
