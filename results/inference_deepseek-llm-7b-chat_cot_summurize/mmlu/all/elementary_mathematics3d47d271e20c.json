Fei Yen bought a 28-pound bag of dog food. How many 8-ounce servings are in a 28-pound bag of dog food?\n\nA. 14\nB. 56\nC. 224\nD. 448\n\nassistant:To determine the number of 8-ounce servings in a 28-pound bag of dog food, we can first convert the weight of the bag to ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, 28 pounds is equal to 28 x 16 = 448 ounces.\n\nNow we can divide the total number of ounces (448) by the serving size (8 ounces) to find the number of servings:\n\n448 ounces / 8 ounces = 56 servings\n\nSo, there are 56 servings of 8 ounces each in a 28-pound bag of dog food. The correct answer is B. 56.",
