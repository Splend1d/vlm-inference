It was 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M. Write and solve an equation to find t the temperature at 6 P.M.\n\nA. 84 \u2212 11 = t; 73\u00b0F\nB. t \u2212 84 = 11; 95\u00b0F\nC. 84 \u2212 t = 11; 73\u00b0F\nD. t \u2212 11 = 84; 95\u00b0F\n\nassistant:To solve the equation, we can use the formula for the difference in temperature between two points:\n\ndifference in temperature = final temperature - initial temperature\n\nIn this case, the difference in temperature is 11\u00b0F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M, and the final temperature is 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M. So, we can write the equation:\n\ndifference in temperature = 84\u00b0F - initial temperature\n\nNow, we know that the difference in temperature is 11\u00b0F, so we can write the equation:\n\n11\u00b0F = 84\u00b0F - initial temperature\n\nTo solve for the initial temperature, we can add the initial temperature to both sides of the equation:\n\ninitial temperature = 84\u00b0F - 11\u00b0F\n\ninitial temperature = 73\u00b0F\n\nSo, the temperature at 6 P.M. was 73\u00b0F. The correct answer is option A.",
