As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second count. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will be\n\nA. granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.\nB. granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.\nC. denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.\nD. denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.\n\nassistant:B. granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.\n\nThe jury's verdicts are legally inconsistent, as they found the defendant guilty on the first count (felony murder) but not guilty on the second count (arson). This inconsistency means that the defendant should be acquitted of both charges. Therefore, the defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge should be granted, as the verdicts are legally inconsistent and adversely affect the defendant's constitutional rights.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The defendant's attorney cannot claim plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights without a specific constitutional provision being violated.\nC. The verdicts do amount to a reversible error, but this does not necessarily mean they should be set aside.\nD. An appeal is not the defendant's proper remedy in this case, as the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal.",
