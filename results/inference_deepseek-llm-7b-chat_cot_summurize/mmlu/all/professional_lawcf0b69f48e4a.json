The manager noticed small fragments of plaster on the floor the day after the reopening, but failed to take immediate action to address the issue. Instead, they posted signs in the affected area and called the painting company for repair, which took some time to arrive.\n\nGiven the situation, the shopper would probably prevail in asserting a claim against the supermarket. The supermarket failed to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of its patrons, particularly when it comes to a foreseeable risk of harm such as falling plaster. The manager's response to the issue was inadequate, as they did not immediately address the problem or take any measures to prevent potential harm to shoppers.\n\nAdditionally, the shopper might have a claim against the painting company as well, since the company was responsible for the repairs and repainting of the ceiling and walls. However, the supermarket is the one that the shopper had direct contact with, and the injury occurred within the supermarket premises. Therefore, the supermarket is more likely to be held liable for the injury, given their responsibility to ensure the safety of their patrons.\n\nIn conclusion, the shopper would most likely prevail in asserting a claim against the supermarket, as the supermarket failed to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of its patrons against an unreasonable risk of harm. The supermarket's manager should have immediately addressed the issue and taken measures to prevent potential harm to shoppers, such as cordoning off the affected area or warning customers of the potential danger.",
