When the Federal Reserve sells Treasury securities, it increases the money supply in the economy by draining funds from the system. This increase in the money supply leads to lower interest rates, which can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing more affordable for businesses and consumers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lowering the discount rate is a contractionary monetary policy measure, which would decrease the money supply and increase interest rates, not increase it.\n\nOption C is incorrect because raising the discount rate is a contractionary monetary policy measure, which would decrease the money supply and increase interest rates, not increase it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because lowering the discount rate is a contractionary monetary policy measure, which would decrease the money supply and increase interest rates, not increase it.",
