He who has understanding, who is mindful and always pure, indeed reaches that place from whence he is not born again.\nfrom the Upanishads, India, circa 600s\u2013400s B.C.E.\nWhich of the following changes to Indian religious practice took place under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka?\n\nA. The rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith\nB. The arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders\nC. The eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force\nD. The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts\n\nassistant:The passage provided refers to a concept from the Upanishads, which is a collection of Hindu scriptures. The passage describes a spiritual state, where the individual understands their true nature and reaches a higher state of consciousness. This concept is closely tied to the Hindu philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, which is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy.\n\nThe question asks which of the following changes to Indian religious practice took place under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Ashoka was a Buddhist monarch who ruled the Mauryan Empire in India from 268 to 232 BCE. He is known for his conversion to Buddhism and his efforts to spread Buddhism throughout his empire.\n\nOption A, the rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith, does not refer to Ashoka's time period. Sikhism emerged in the Punjab region of India in the 15th century, long after the time of Ashoka.\n\nOption B, the arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders, also does not refer to Ashoka's time period. Islam began in the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century, more than a millennium after Ashoka's reign.\n\nOption C, the eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force, is incorrect. Ashoka is known for his promotion of Buddhism, not the eradication of Hinduism. In fact, he was a devout Hindu before his conversion to Buddhism.\n\nOption D, the official encouragement of Buddhist edicts, is the correct answer. Ashoka's reign saw the spread of Buddhism throughout his empire, and he is known for commissioning edicts to promote Buddhism and to discourage violence and war. These edicts were carved on rocks and pillars throughout his empire, and many of them have survived to this day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts.",
