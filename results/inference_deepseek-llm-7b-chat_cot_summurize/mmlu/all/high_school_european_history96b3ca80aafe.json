Germany promised to help regain Soviet land lost in the First World War\nB. the attempt by the Soviets to form an alliance with Britain and France had failed\nC. they wanted to assist the Germans in seizing land from Czechoslovakia\nD. they held debt to Germany stemming from the First World War\n\nassistant:The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union, was a non-aggression pact that laid the foundation for the eventual German-Soviet invasion of Poland, and ultimately, the outbreak of World War II. The pact itself was a product of several factors, including the desire of both countries to maintain peace, as well as their mutual desire to avoid being encircled by the other's potential enemies.\n\nIn the context of the question, the Soviets were most strongly motivated to create this agreement because the attempt by the Soviets to form an alliance with Britain and France had failed. This is option B. The Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, was eager to avoid being encircled by Western powers and to establish friendly relations with Germany, the dominant power in Europe at the time. The Soviet Union had already suffered a humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet War in 1920, and it was keen to avoid a similar fate.\n\nThe other options are not as strongly motivated as option B. While Germany did promise to help regain Soviet land lost in the First World War, this was not a significant factor in motivating the Soviets to sign the pact. Similarly, the Soviets did not want to assist the Germans in seizing land from Czechoslovakia, and they did not hold debt to Germany stemming from the First World War.\n\nIn conclusion, the Soviets were most strongly motivated to create the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact because the attempt by the Soviets to form an alliance with Britain and France had failed. This allowed the Soviet Union to establish friendly relations with Germany, paving the way for the eventual German-Soviet invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II.",
