The New Left.\n\nassistant:The Port Huron Statement, excerpted above, can most clearly be seen as an important document in the New Left movement. The New Left was a political and social movement in the United States and other countries during the 1960s and 1970s. It was a reaction against the policies and values of the U.S. government and corporate power during the Cold War era, and it sought to promote social and political change through nonviolent means. The movement was characterized by its focus on issues such as civil rights, nuclear disarmament, and opposition to the Vietnam War. The excerpt from the Port Huron Statement highlights the concerns of the movement, including the struggle against racial bigotry, the threat of nuclear war, and the importance of individual freedom and equality.",
