No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\n\nThe customer's lawsuit should not be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant solely due to negligence. The restaurant may have taken reasonable measures to eliminate foreign objects from its product, such as inspecting the fish for hooks before serving them. Therefore, strict liability should be imposed on the seller for selling an unreasonably dangerous product, which caused the minor child to suffer injuries.",
