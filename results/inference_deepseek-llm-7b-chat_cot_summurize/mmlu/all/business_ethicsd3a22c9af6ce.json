Top, Standardisation, Political, Economic\n\nassistant:The answer is A. Bottom, Globalisation, Social, Environmental.\n\nThe race to the bottom is a concept in international relations, in which countries compete with each other to attract foreign investment by weakening their social, environmental, and economic regulations and standards. The aim is to make their countries more attractive to businesses by offering lower costs, such as lower wages and fewer environmental regulations.\n\nGlobalisation is a driving force behind this competition, as it allows companies to operate on a global scale and seek out the most advantageous locations for their operations. This can lead to a race to the bottom, as countries compete to offer the lowest wages and environmental standards in order to attract foreign investment.\n\nSocial refers to the social regulations and standards that a country may weaken in order to attract foreign investment. This can include issues such as worker's rights, safety regulations, and environmental protection.\n\nEnvironmental refers to the environmental regulations and standards that a country may weaken in order to attract foreign investment. This can include issues such as pollution controls, conservation efforts, and climate change mitigation.",
