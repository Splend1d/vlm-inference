Which of the harmonics, if any, will survive once the pipe is closed at one end?\n\nA. 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\nB. 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\nC. 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\nD. None\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's first understand the concept of harmonics in organ pipes.\n\nHarmonics are overtones or partials that are produced by a vibrating object in addition to the fundamental frequency. In the case of organ pipes, the fundamental frequency is the lowest note that can be produced. When the pipe is open at both ends, all harmonics are produced. However, when the pipe is closed at one end, only the harmonics that have even multiples of the fundamental frequency will be produced. The harmonics with odd multiples will be absorbed by the pipe.\n\nGiven the harmonics produced by the organ pipe, let's analyze which ones will survive when the pipe is closed at one end:\n\n1. 50 Hz (odd multiple) - Absorbed\n2. 100 Hz (even multiple) - Survives\n3. 150 Hz (odd multiple) - Absorbed\n4. 200 Hz (even multiple) - Survives\n5. 250 Hz (odd multiple) - Absorbed\n\nThe only harmonics that survive are 100 Hz and 200 Hz. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 100 Hz and 200 Hz only.",
