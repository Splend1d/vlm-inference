She divides her stickers equally among herself and two friends. Each person gets 4 stickers. Which equation represents the total number, s, of stickers?\n\nA. s + 3=4\nB. s - 3=4\nC. s/3 = 4\nD. 3s = 4\n\nassistant:To find the total number of stickers, we need to add the number of stickers each person gets. There are 3 people, so we multiply the number of stickers each person gets by 3.\n\nElizabeth, her two friends, and herself have 4 stickers each. So the equation to represent the total number of stickers is:\n\ns = 4 \\* 3 = 12\n\nThe correct answer is C. s/3 = 4.",
