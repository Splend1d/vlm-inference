The victim State may use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor\nB. The victim State may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor\nC. The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor\nD. The victim State can do nothing without Security Council approval\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The victim State may only use such means and force as is necessary to defeat the aggressor.\n\nIn international law, proportionality is a principle that requires that any response to an aggression or threat must be proportionate to the threat or aggression. This means that a victim State must only use the minimum amount of force necessary to effectively respond to the aggression or threat. This principle is derived from the principle of necessity, which states that a State may only use force if it is absolutely necessary to respond to an aggression or threat.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the victim State may use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor, which is not in accordance with the principle of proportionality.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that the victim State may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor, which is not necessarily in accordance with the principle of proportionality.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that the victim State can do nothing without Security Council approval, which is not in accordance with the principle of proportionality, which allows for the use of force only when necessary.",
