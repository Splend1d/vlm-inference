The commerce clause.\n\nassistant:The most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge would be the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This provision states that all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside, and shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. In this case, the tax imposed on nonresident's city derived income is different from the tax imposed on resident's income, which could be seen as a form of unequal treatment. Additionally, the tax is reduced if the nonresident's state of residence would impose a lesser tax had the income been earned in that state, which could also be seen as unequal treatment based on the location of the nonresident's income.",
