If her daily round trip is rounded to the nearest 5 miles, which of the following is the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days?\n\nA. 75 miles\nB. 100 miles\nC. 125 miles\nD. 180 miles\n\nassistant:To find the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days, we need to first round Abby's daily mileage to the nearest 5 miles.\n\nAbby's daily mileage is 18 miles, so the closest 5-mile increment is 13 (18 - 5).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total miles driven in 5 days:\n\nTotal miles = (18 miles per day) x (5 days)\nTotal miles = 90 miles\n\nNow, let's round 90 miles to the nearest 5 miles.\n\n90 miles is closest to 95 miles.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days is 95 miles.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 180 miles.",
