Inquiry and other procedures such as observation.\n\nExplanation: When written documentation is not available to verify the operating effectiveness of a control, an auditor must gather evidence through inquiry and other procedures such as observation. This is because the purpose of an audit is to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Therefore, auditors must rely on their professional judgment and obtain evidence from various sources to assess the operating effectiveness of a control. Mailing confirmations and analytical procedures are not as effective in this scenario. Recalculating the balance in related accounts is not relevant to the auditor's objective of assessing the operating effectiveness of a control.",
