Cyanobacteria reduce sulfur compounds.\nB. Cyanobacteria lack cell walls.\nC. Cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\nD. Green algae produce cell membranes.\n\nassistant:A. Cyanobacteria reduce sulfur compounds.\n\nCyanobacteria and green unicellular algae are both photosynthetic organisms, but they have some differences. Cyanobacteria are able to reduce sulfur compounds, which helps them to obtain energy from the sun. In contrast, green unicellular algae do not have this ability. Additionally, cyanobacteria have a unique ability to produce oxygen through photosynthesis, which is essential for life on Earth.",
