At her current consumption bundle, the marginal utility of chips is 12 and the marginal utility of dip is 30. Mrs. Johnson should\n\nA. do nothing; she is consuming her utility maximizing combination of chips and dip.\nB. increase her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.\nC. decrease her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.\nD. decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nassistant:To determine the best course of action for Mrs. Johnson, we can use the indifference curves method. Let's denote the consumption of chips as C and the consumption of dip as D. The budget constraint is given by:\n\nC + D = $18 (daily budget)\n\nThe utility function is given by:\n\nU(C, D) = 12(C - k) + 30(D - m)\n\nwhere k and m are the marginal utilities of chips and dip, respectively.\n\nMrs. Johnson is currently consuming a bundle of (6, 2), meaning she has consumed 6 chips and 2 dips. To find the utility of this bundle, we can plug in the values into the utility function:\n\nU(6, 2) = 12(6 - k) + 30(2 - m) = 72 - 12k + 60 - 30m\n\nNow, let's find the utility of the bundle (0, 0) (no consumption of chips or dip):\n\nU(0, 0) = 12(0 - k) + 30(0 - m) = -12k + 30m\n\nMrs. Johnson should consume the bundle that maximizes her utility. Since the utility function is linear, the indifference curve is a straight line. The maximum utility bundle is given by:\n\nU(6, 2) = 72 - 12k + 60 - 30m\n\nSince the marginal utility of chips is 12 and the marginal utility of dip is 30, the indifference curve will be a straight line through the point (6, 2). To find the optimal consumption bundle, we need to find the point on this curve that maximizes utility.\n\nWe can find the slope of the indifference curve by taking the derivative of the utility function with respect to C or D:\n\n\u2202U/\u2202C = -12 + 30m\n\u2202U/\u2202D = 12k - 30\n\nThe slope of the indifference curve is the negative of the derivative with respect to C:\n\n-12 + 30m\n\nNow, we can set up the following equation to find the optimal consumption bundle:\n\n-12 + 30m = 72 - 12k + 60 - 30m\n\nSolving for k:\n\n-12 + 30m = 72 - 12k\n30m = 84 - 12k\nm = (84 - 12k) / 30\n\nNow, we can find the optimal consumption of chips:\n\n-12 + 30((84 - 12k) / 30) = 60\n(84 - 12k) = 48\nk = 48 / 12 = 4\n\nSo, the optimal consumption bundle for Mrs. Johnson is (4, 2).\n\nTo answer the question, Mrs. Johnson should do nothing; she is consuming her utility maximizing combination of chips and dip. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
