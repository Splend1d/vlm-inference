Conduction\nB. Radiation\nC. Convection\nD. Induction\n\nassistant:D. Induction is not one of the three methods of heat transfer. Induction refers to the process of transferring energy through a magnetic field, which is not a method of heat transfer. The other three methods are conduction (transfer through direct contact), radiation (transfer through electromagnetic waves), and convection (transfer through movement of a fluid, such as air or water).",
