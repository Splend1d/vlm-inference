These peoples were engaged in the practice of farming, which required a stable and reliable food supply. They were likely organized into communities with some form of social hierarchy, indicating that they had a degree of control over their resources.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. affluent foragers: This option is not accurate as the peoples who built these structures were not foragers, but rather agriculturalists who cultivated crops and raised livestock.\n\nC. archaic states: This option is not entirely accurate either, as the people who built these structures were not in a state that can be described as archaic, but rather they were agricultural societies.\n\nD. primitive civilizations: This option is also incorrect, as the people who built these structures were not primitive civilizations, but rather agricultural societies that were organized into communities and had some degree of control over their resources.",
