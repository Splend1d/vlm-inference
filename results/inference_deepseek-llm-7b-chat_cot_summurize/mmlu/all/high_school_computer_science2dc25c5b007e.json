Assuming that the most efficient searching algorithm is used, what is the maximum number of elements that must be examined?\n\nA. 7\nB. 8\nC. 20\nD. 100\n\nassistant:To determine the maximum number of elements that must be examined when searching for a specific value in a sorted list, you can use the binary search algorithm. This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, starting from the beginning of the list, until the value is found or until the interval is empty.\n\nIn the binary search algorithm, the maximum number of elements examined is always equal to the logarithm of the number of elements in the list, rounded down. In this case, the number of elements in the list is 120.\n\nLog base 2 of 120 is approximately 6.18. Since you can't have a fraction of an element, the maximum number of elements examined is rounded down to 6. Therefore, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is 6.\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided do not include 6. Therefore, the best answer is B. 8. This is because the binary search algorithm, in its worst-case scenario, would examine 8 elements before finding the target value or determining that it is not in the list.",
