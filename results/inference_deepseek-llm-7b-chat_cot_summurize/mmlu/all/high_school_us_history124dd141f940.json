A supporter of feminism in the 1970s\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to understand the context of Logan's speech and identify the key themes and issues he addresses. In the speech, Logan expresses his love for the whites, his advocacy for peace, and his desire to live in harmony with them. However, he also describes the brutal murder of his family by Colonel Cresap and his pursuit of revenge. The speech concludes with Logan expressing his joy for peace and his refusal to turn away from his cause, even if it means sacrificing his life.\n\nNow, let's consider the options for finding a group or individual that might see themselves in Logan's position:\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s: This group might have similar sentiments to Logan's love for the whites, advocating for peace and harmony. However, they might also face oppression and retaliation from the government, similar to Logan's experience with Colonel Cresap. This group could potentially identify with Logan's pursuit of revenge against the government.\n\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s: This group might share Logan's advocacy for peace, but consumerism is not a theme directly related to his speech. They might not have the same experiences of persecution or conflict, so this option is less likely.\n\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s: This group might share Logan's love for the whites and his desire for peace. However, their focus on individual rights and freedoms might not align with Logan's advocacy for his people and his desire to protect them from harm. This option is less likely.\n\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s: This group might share some similarities with Logan, such as their advocacy for peace and their desire to protect their people. However, their focus on women's rights might not align with Logan's advocacy for his people as a whole. This option is less likely.\n\nConsidering all the options, the group most likely to see themselves in Logan's position is an opponent of big government in the 1930s. Like Logan, they might face oppression and retaliation from the government, and they might feel compelled to seek revenge or protect their people.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
