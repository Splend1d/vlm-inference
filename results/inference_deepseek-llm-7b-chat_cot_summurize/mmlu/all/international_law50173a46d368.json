The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction on the State sharing the nationality of the offender\nD. The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction to the State on whose territory the conduct produces effects\n\nassistant:The effects doctrine is a legal principle that serves to confer jurisdiction on the State that is most closely linked to the harmful conduct, even if it does not have effective jurisdiction. This means that a State can be granted jurisdiction over a case if the conduct in question has a significant effect within its territory, even if the offender is not a citizen of the State or the offense was committed there. This doctrine is typically used in cases of criminal law and is intended to prevent extraterritoriality, or the exercise of jurisdiction beyond a State's borders. The answer is D. The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction to the State on whose territory the conduct produces effects.",
