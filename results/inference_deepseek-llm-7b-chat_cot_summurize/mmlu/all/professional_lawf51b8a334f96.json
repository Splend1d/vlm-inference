Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer.

The farmer, because he has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nIn this case, the farmer has used the water from the stream for irrigation purposes since 1974, while the rancher began taking water from the stream only in 2008. The farmer's use of the water is therefore established and superior to the rancher's. Additionally, the farmer has used the water continuously for farming purposes, while the rancher's use is intermittent and for domestic purposes only. Therefore, the farmer's water rights should be considered superior to the rancher's, and the full flow of the stream should be passed to the farmer.",
