He describes the pain as tearing in quality and radiating to the neck. One week earlier he experienced similar but less severe chest pain and treated himself with aspirin.

Esophageal reflux with spasm\n\nassistant:The most likely underlying cause for the man's worsening symptoms is C. Dissection of the aorta. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that increases the risk of aortic dissection, which can cause severe chest pain and even death if left untreated. The man's history of aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation, as well as his recent worsening symptoms, support this diagnosis. Acute bacterial endocarditis and acute myocardial infarction are less likely given the man's description of his pain as tearing and radiating to the neck, which are more consistent with aortic dissection. Esophageal reflux with spasm is also less likely as the man already had less severe symptoms one week earlier and treated himself with aspirin, which is not effective for esophageal reflux.",
