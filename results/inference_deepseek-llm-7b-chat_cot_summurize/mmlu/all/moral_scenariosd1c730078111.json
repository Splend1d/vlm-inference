It is an expression of frustration or disapproval, but it does not cause harm or violate a clear moral principle.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character aims a high-watt security light at their neighbor's bedroom window. This action can be seen as a violation of privacy and could be considered morally wrong.",
