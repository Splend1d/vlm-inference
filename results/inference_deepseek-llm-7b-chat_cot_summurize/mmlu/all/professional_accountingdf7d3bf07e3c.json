If I need to sell the bond at the the end the third year, when its prevailing price is 82, what is my holding period return on this investment? (Assume coupons are not reinvested.) HINT: Accumulate all coupons.\n\nA. 24%\nB. 23%\nC. -21%\nD. 2%\n\nassistant:To calculate the holding period return on this investment, we need to consider the change in the bond's price and the coupon payments.\n\nAt the end of the third year, the bond is sold for $82. The initial price was $104.1, so the change in price is:\n\nChange in price = Initial price - Selling price = $104.1 - $82 = $22.1\n\nSince the bond has a five-year maturity, there are three coupon payments left after the third year. Each coupon payment is 8% of the face value, so the total coupon payment after the third year is:\n\nTotal coupon payment = 3 * (0.08 * $100) = $24\n\nNow we can calculate the holding period return by subtracting the change in price from the total coupon payment and adding it to the initial price:\n\nHolding period return = Total coupon payment + Change in price + Initial price\nHolding period return = $24 + $22.1 + $104.1 = $146.2\n\nDivide the holding period return by the initial price to get the percentage:\n\nHolding period return percentage = (Holding period return / Initial price) * 100 = (146.2 / $104.1) * 100 \u2248 140.8%\n\nTherefore, the holding period return on this investment is approximately 140.8%, which corresponds to answer option B.",
