Passive, Individuals, Represented, Retain\n\nassistant:The answer is A. Proactive, Groups, Under-represented, Increase.\n\nAffirmative action is a proactive attempt to target groups who are underrepresented within an organization's workforce. This means that the organization tries to increase the proportion of women, disabled, or racial minorities in senior management positions. The correct answer is A because it correctly describes affirmative action as targeting underrepresented groups and increasing their presence in the organization.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it is passive, not proactive, and it focuses on retaining the current representation of underrepresented groups rather than increasing it. Option C is incorrect because it targets individuals, not groups, and it only increases the representation of underrepresented groups, not necessarily their proportion in senior management positions. Option D is incorrect because it is passive, not proactive, and it focuses on retaining the current representation of underrepresented groups rather than increasing it.",
