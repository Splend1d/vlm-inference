This is because in the state of nature, each individual is free to act as they please, without any external authority to control them. However, this freedom is also accompanied by uncertainty and vulnerability, as individuals are subject to the whims of chance and the actions of others. In order to escape this state of uncertainty and vulnerability, individuals are willing to relinquish some of their freedom in exchange for the security and protection that the state can provide. This is why option C is the correct answer.",
