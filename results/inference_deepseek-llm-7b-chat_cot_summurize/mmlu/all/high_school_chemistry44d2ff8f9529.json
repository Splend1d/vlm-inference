Does reduction or oxidation occur when dichromate forms Cr3+?\n\nA. 3+, reduction\nB. 12+, reduction\nC. 6+, reduction\nD. 6+, oxidation\n\nassistant:The oxidation state of chromium in the dichromate ion, Cr2O7^2-, is +6. When the dichromate ion reacts, it forms chromium(III) ions, Cr3+, through a process of reduction. The oxidation state of chromium in Cr3+ is +3. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 6+, reduction.",
