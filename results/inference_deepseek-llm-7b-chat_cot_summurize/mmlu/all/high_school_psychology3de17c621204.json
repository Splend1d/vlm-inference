In a sample of 30 supporters, it was discovered that 22 of them gave $60, six of them gave $1,000, and two of them gave $10,000. Based on this sample, which of the following measures of central tendency would provide the most useful information to the radio station?\n\nA. Median\nB. Mode\nC. Histogram\nD. ANOVA\n\nassistant:The most useful measure of central tendency in this case would be the median. The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in order. In this case, since there are 30 supporters, the median would be the 15th value when arranged in order. If the other values were evenly distributed, the median would be the average of the 15th and 16th values. However, since there are two supporters who gave $10,000, the median will be higher than the average of the $60 and $1,000 contributions. Therefore, the median will provide a better estimate of the typical contribution amount than the average. The mode, which is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset, would not be useful in this case since there are multiple values that occur more than once. A histogram is a visual representation of the frequency distribution of the dataset, but it does not provide a single measure of central tendency. An ANOVA (analysis of variance) is a statistical technique used to determine differences between means, but it is not a measure of central tendency. Therefore, the most useful measure of central tendency in this case is the median.",
