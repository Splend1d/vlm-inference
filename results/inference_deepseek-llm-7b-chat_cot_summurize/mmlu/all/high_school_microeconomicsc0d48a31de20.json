Enact stricter antitrust legislation\nB. Provide more complete information about the relevant goods\nC. Supply public goods using tax dollars\nD. Tax those creating negative externalities\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Supply public goods using tax dollars.\n\nThe free rider problem occurs when individuals who benefit from a public good do not contribute to its cost, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. To avoid this problem, the government can supply public goods using tax dollars. This approach ensures that all individuals contribute to the cost of providing the good, which can help prevent free ridership.\n\nA. Enacting stricter antitrust legislation may address competition issues in the private market, but it does not directly address the free rider problem related to public goods.\n\nB. Providing more complete information about the relevant goods can help individuals make informed decisions about whether or not to use the public good, but it does not incentivize them to contribute to its cost.\n\nD. Taxing those creating negative externalities is a valid approach to address the free rider problem in certain contexts, but it does not directly address the issue of public goods.",
