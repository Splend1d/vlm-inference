Christian abolitionist rejection of slavery on moral grounds\n\nassistant:The reference to \"the sanctions of a more erroneous religious belief\" in the excerpt above most probably refers to A. Southern Baptist justification of slavery on the grounds of white racial superiority. This is because the excerpt discusses the Republican party's stance on slavery, and it is known that Southern Baptists, as a religious group, supported slavery and believed it was justified based on their interpretation of the Bible and the idea of white racial superiority.\n\nThe excerpt also mentions that the Republican party plans to wage war against slavery until it ceases throughout the United States, which further indicates that the religious belief being referred to is likely Southern Baptist justification of slavery.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Southern Baptist justification of slavery on the grounds of white racial superiority.",
