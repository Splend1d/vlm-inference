This is indicated in the passage, which states that \"Strange and costly objects do not interest me. As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things.\" This suggests that the Chinese already had everything they needed and did not see the value in trading with Great Britain for additional goods.\n\nA. The Chinese were not angry over Britain's interference in their foreign affairs, as the passage does not mention any such interference.\nB. The Chinese did have a preexisting exclusive trade agreement with the Dutch, but this does not explain their lack of interest in expanding trade with Great Britain.\nD. The Chinese were not afraid that the British would gain too much influence within China, as the passage does not mention any such concerns.",
