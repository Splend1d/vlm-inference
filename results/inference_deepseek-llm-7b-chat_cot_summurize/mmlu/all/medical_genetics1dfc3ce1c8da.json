Almost 100%\n\nassistant:I'm sorry, but I am not able to provide medical advice. However, I can tell you that phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to process the amino acid phenylalanine. If a woman has PKU and does not follow a low-phenylalanine diet, her unborn child has a higher risk of developing neurological problems. The exact risk varies depending on the severity of the mother's PKU and other factors, but it is generally accepted that the risk is higher than 1%.",
