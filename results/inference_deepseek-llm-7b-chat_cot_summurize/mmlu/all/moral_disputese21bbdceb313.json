(i) explain the harms of anal sex and (ii) establish that all homosexuals will inevitably suffer those harms.\nB. (i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and (ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.\nC.

(i) explain the value of naturalness and (ii) why nothing \"unnatural\" can be of value.\n\nassistant:The charge of \"unnaturalness\" in the context of Corvino's argument refers to the belief that homosexual behavior is morally wrong because it goes against nature. According to Corvino, for this charge to carry moral weight, those who level it must be able to do the following:\n\nA. Provide evidence of the harms associated with anal sex, and establish that all homosexuals will inevitably suffer those harms. This would involve showing that anal sex is linked to specific health risks or negative outcomes, and that these risks apply to all homosexual individuals regardless of their choices or circumstances.\n\nB. Clearly define what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and explain why unnaturalness (as defined) is relevant to moral evaluation. This would involve providing a definition of what constitutes \"unnatural\" behavior, and explaining why this definition is relevant to moral judgments about actions and choices.\n\nC. Establish that one's sexual orientation is a matter of choice, and that people who choose homosexuality have an intrinsic desire for self-harm. This would involve arguing that homosexual orientation is a decision or preference made by the individual, and that engaging in homosexual behavior is therefore a form of self-harm or self-destructive behavior.\n\nD. Explain the value of naturalness and why nothing \"unnatural\" can be of value. This would involve presenting a view of what constitutes \"natural\" behavior or values, and arguing that anything that deviates from this natural state is inherently flawed or without value.\n\nBy failing to meet these criteria, critics of Corvino's argument may be seen as relying on unsubstantiated moral judgments or subjective preferences, rather than objective evidence or rational arguments.",
