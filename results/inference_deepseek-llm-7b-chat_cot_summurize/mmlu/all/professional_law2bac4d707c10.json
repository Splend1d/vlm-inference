The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.\n\nassistant:The best argument for the son in this situation would be that the condition in the Declaration of Covenants cannot be enforced against him because his deed did not reference the Declaration of Covenants or any of its provisions. As the son was unaware of the Declaration of Covenants, he was not in violation of its restrictions. Therefore, the geologist cannot enforce the restriction against the son.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the son's deed did not create a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter.\nOption D is incorrect because there is no law that prohibits a fee simple determinable.\nOption C is incorrect because an injunction is not the only remedy available to the geologist. Ejectment, which is what the geologist brought against the son, is another possible remedy.\n\nTherefore, the best argument for the son is that the son is not in violation of the restriction in the Declaration of Covenants because he was not aware of it and it was not included in his deed.",
