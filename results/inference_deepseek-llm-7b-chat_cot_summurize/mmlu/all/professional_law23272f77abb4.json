The neighbor wheeled his lawn mower to the man's property and started the engine.

Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\nB. Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\nC. No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\nD. No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\n\nIn this scenario, the man made an offer to the neighbor that if the neighbor mows his lawn, the man will pay him $50. The neighbor accepted the offer by purchasing gasoline for the mower and starting to mow the lawn. At this point, the man attempted to revoke his offer, but it was too late. Once an offer becomes irrevocable, it cannot be revoked. In this case, the man's offer had become irrevocable prior to his attempted revocation, so the neighbor would be entitled to the $50.\n\nOption B is incorrect because quasi-contracts are not applicable in this scenario. A quasi-contract is a legal theory that allows a court to impose a legal duty on one party to compensate another party for services rendered when there is no valid contract between them. However, in this scenario, there was a valid contract between the man and the neighbor, and the man attempted to revoke it before the neighbor completed performance.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the man's revocation was not effective. The revocation only became effective after the neighbor had completed performance, which was after the man attempted to revoke the offer.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the neighbor had not done anything more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation. The neighbor had not yet completed performance when the man attempted to revoke the offer.",
