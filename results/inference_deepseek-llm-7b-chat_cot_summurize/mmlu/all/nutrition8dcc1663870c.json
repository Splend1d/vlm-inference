Stool bulking occurs mainly through the action of insoluble fibres such as cellulose\n\nassistant:B. Fermentation studies in vitro, with human faeces, have shown that soluble and insoluble forms are fermented completely within 24 hours.\n\nThis statement is most correct as it accurately describes the process of dietary fiber fermentation in the human body. Both soluble and insoluble forms of dietary fiber are fermented within 24 hours, producing short-chain fatty acids that have a beneficial effect on the colon.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the end products of dietary fiber fermentation are not mainly malic, succinic, and propionic acids. Instead, they are primarily short-chain fatty acids like butyric, propionic, and acetate.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it mentions hemicelluloses, pectins, and inulin as dietary fiber sources, which are not as prevalent as insoluble fiber sources like cellulose. Additionally, the statement does not mention the complete fermentation of dietary fiber within 24 hours.\n\nOption D is incorrect because stool bulking mainly occurs through the action of soluble fibers like pectin and gums, not insoluble fibers like cellulose.",
