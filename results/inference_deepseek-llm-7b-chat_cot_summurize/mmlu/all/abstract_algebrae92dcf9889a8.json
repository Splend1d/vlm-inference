Statement 2 | If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian.\n\nThis statement is true. If K is a subgroup of a free abelian group, then K is also abelian because the order of an element in K divides the order of the group, which in turn is infinite since the group is free abelian. Hence, K is free abelian.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian.\n\nThis statement is false. The quotient group G / K is not necessarily free abelian. In fact, it is often a free group, but it can also be a non-free group. For example, consider the group of integers modulo 4, which is a free abelian group. If we consider the subgroup generated by 1 (the integers), then the quotient group is the free group on two generators, which is not free abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B.
