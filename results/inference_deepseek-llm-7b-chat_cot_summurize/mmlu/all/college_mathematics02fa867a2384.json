Additionally, there is no identity element in this operation because for any element m in Z, (m \u2022 0) \u2260 m (m + 0 + m0) \u2260 m (m + 0) \u2260 m (0 + m + m0) \u2260 0. Therefore, statements I and II are true. Statement III is not true because every element in Z has an inverse (the additive inverse). Statement IV is not true because the operation is not a group.",
