You decide to add in $\\ell_2$ regularization to penalize the weights. As you increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, what will happen to the bias and variance of the model?\n\nA. Bias increase ; Variance increase\nB. Bias increase ; Variance decrease\nC. Bias decrease ; Variance increase\nD. Bias decrease ; Variance decrease\n\nassistant:As you increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, the model's bias and variance will change in the following way:\n\n1. Bias: The bias will increase. This is because the regularization term will penalize the model's ability to fit the training data perfectly, causing it to shift towards underfitting.\n\n2. Variance: The variance will decrease. This is because the regularization term will penalize the model's complexity, causing it to become simpler and less sensitive to the noise in the training data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Bias increase ; Variance decrease.",
