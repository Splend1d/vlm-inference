Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones. They selectively bind to androgen receptors, allowing them to produce anabolic androgenic effects, while minimizing side effects associated with anabolic steroids.",
