Gastroesophageal reflux disease\nD. Postnasal drip syndrome\n\nassistant:The most likely diagnosis in this case is A. Asthma. The patient's symptoms, such as exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, as well as her family history of asthma, suggest a diagnosis of asthma. The other options are less likely because they do not typically present with exercise-induced cough and do not typically affect the upper respiratory tract.",
