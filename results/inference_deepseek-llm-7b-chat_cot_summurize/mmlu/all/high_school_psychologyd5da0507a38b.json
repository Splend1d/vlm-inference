She has difficulty focusing on the teacher's words and looks around the classroom while the teacher is talking, which are common symptoms of ADHD. Additionally, she may not know what to do when others are starting their assignments, as she may struggle with organization and time management. While panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder can also cause similar symptoms, ADHD is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",
