The numbers in the first expression are 3.18, 3, and 1, and the numbers in the second expression are 8, 3.8, 3.18, and 3.\n2. In the first expression, the numbers are in descending order, so we will swap the numbers to make them in ascending order: 1, 3, and 3.18.\n3. In the second expression, we need to compare the numbers 3.18, 3, and 1 to the numbers in the second expression.\n4. The numbers in the second expression are also in descending order, so we will swap the numbers to make them in ascending order: 3.8, 3.18, 8, and 3.\n5. Now, we can compare the numbers from the first expression to the numbers from the second expression:\n\n3.18 (from the first expression) < 3.8 (from the second expression)\n3 (from the first expression) < 3.18 (from the second expression)\n1 (from the first expression) < 8 (from the second expression)\n\nSo, the order from greatest to least is: 3, 1, 3.18, 3, 8, 3.18, 3.8.\n\nThe correct answer is B.",
