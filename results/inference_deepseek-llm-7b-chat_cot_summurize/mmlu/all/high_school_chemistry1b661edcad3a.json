CH3COOH\nB. HC2H3O2\nC. PCl5\nD. HBr\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. HC2H3O2, which is the molecular formula for acetic acid, is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water.\n\nA strong electrolyte is a substance that dissociates completely into ions when it is dissolved in water. In this case, acetic acid dissociates completely into a positively charged hydrogen ion (H+) and a negatively charged acetate ion (C2H3O2-). When these ions are present in water, they can conduct electricity, making acetic acid a strong electrolyte.\n\nThe other molecules listed (A, C, and D) are not strong electrolytes when dissolved in water. In the case of A, CH3COOH, only a small fraction of the molecule dissociates, and it is not enough to conduct electricity. The same is true for C, PCl5, which does not dissociate at all when dissolved in water. And D, HBr, dissociates to some extent, but it is not a strong electrolyte like acetic acid.",
