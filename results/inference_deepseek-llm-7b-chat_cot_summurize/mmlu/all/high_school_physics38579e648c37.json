How far does the car travel during this time?\n\nA. 150 m \nB. 300 m\nC. 450 m\nD. 600 m\n\nassistant:The distance traveled by the car during acceleration is given by the formula:\n\ndistance = initial_velocity * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time^2\n\nwhere initial_velocity = 0 (the car starts from rest), acceleration = final_velocity / time, and time = 15 s.\n\nSo,\n\ndistance = 0 * 15 + 0.5 * (20/15) * 15^2\ndistance = 0 + 0.5 * 4 * 225\ndistance = 0 + 450\n\nTherefore, the car travels 450 meters during this time. The correct answer is C. 450 m.",
