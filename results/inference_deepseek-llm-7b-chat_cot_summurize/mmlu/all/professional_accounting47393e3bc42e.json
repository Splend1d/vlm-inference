No effect No effect\n\nassistant:To determine how the error in the amortization of the premium bonds affected the carrying amount and retained earnings, we need to examine the financial statements for Dean Co. on June 30, year 12.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the financial statements.\nTo calculate the carrying amount of the bond and retained earnings, we need to use the effective interest method, which takes into account both the interest and principal portion of the bond.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the corrected amortization amount.\nUsing the effective interest method, we can calculate the corrected amortization amount for the bond as follows:\n\nCorrected amortization amount = (Face value of the bond * Interest rate) / (365 days in a year)\n\nStep 3: Compare the corrected amortization amount with the original amortization amount.\nIf the original amortization amount was calculated using the straight-line method, we can compare the corrected amortization amount with the original amount to determine the impact on the carrying amount of the bond and retained earnings.\n\nStep 4: Determine the effect on bond carrying amount and retained earnings.\nIf the corrected amortization amount is higher than the original amortization amount, the carrying amount of the bond will be overstated, and retained earnings will be overstated. If the corrected amortization amount is lower than the original amortization amount, the carrying amount of the bond will be understated, and retained earnings will be understated. If the corrected amortization amount is equal to the original amortization amount, there will be no effect on the carrying amount of the bond or retained earnings.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot determine the exact effect on bond carrying amount and retained earnings. However, if we assume that the straight-line method overestimates the amortization amount, the corrected amortization amount would be lower than the original amortization amount, and there would be an understatement of the carrying amount of the bond and retained earnings. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nD. No effect on bond carrying amount and retained earnings.",
