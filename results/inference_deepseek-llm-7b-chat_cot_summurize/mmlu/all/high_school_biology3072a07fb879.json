Biogeography\nC. Physiology\nD. Biochemistry\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Biogeography.\n\nThe difference in prehensile tails between monkeys of South and Central America and those of African and Asian monkeys can be explained by biogeography. Biogeography is the study of the distribution of species and their environments, and how these distributions have evolved over time. In this case, the prehensile tails of South and Central American monkeys may have evolved as a result of their geographic isolation from other monkey populations, allowing them to adapt to their specific environment.",
