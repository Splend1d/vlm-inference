Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\n\nThis question is based on the United States Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause. The Farstate Department of Wealth Equality is a state agency, and its actions are subject to the same constitutional scrutiny as other state agencies.\n\nA. The action is arbitrary and capricious, so it is unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny standard. This answer is incorrect because the rule in question is not arbitrary or capricious. The rule is based on a legitimate governmental purpose: to eliminate wealth inequality and provide aid to the poor.\n\nB. The action is not deemed done by a state actor because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function. This answer is also incorrect because wealth redistribution is an essential government function in some cases, such as providing welfare benefits to the poor.\n\nD. Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny. This answer is incorrect because the rule is not targeting a quasi-suspect class. It is targeting individuals with a net worth over $10,000.00, which is not a protected class under the Constitution.\n\nC. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process. This answer is correct because the employees in this case have a protected property interest in their employment, and the state agency violated their due process rights by firing them without providing notice or a hearing. The state agency's rule was not necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, and the rule's implementation was therefore unconstitutional.",
