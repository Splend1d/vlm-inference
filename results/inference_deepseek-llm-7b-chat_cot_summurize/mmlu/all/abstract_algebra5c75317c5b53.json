Z\n\nassistant:To find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of the group 2Z, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Write down the subgroup 4Z: {0, 4, 8, 12, 16}\n2. Subtract the identity element 0 of 2Z from every element in 4Z: {4, 8, 12, 16}\n3. Add the identity element 0 of 2Z to each element of the coset {4, 8, 12, 16}: {0, 4, 8, 12, 16}\n4. The cosets are {0, 4, 8, 12, 16}, {0, 4, 8, 12, 16}, and {0, 4, 8, 12, 16}.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Z",
