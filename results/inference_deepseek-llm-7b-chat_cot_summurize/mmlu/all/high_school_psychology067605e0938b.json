This exemplifies negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement involves removing or reducing an unpleasant stimulus, which in this case is the child being removed from the classroom. This is different from positive reinforcement, which involves adding a pleasant stimulus, and positive punishment, which involves increasing an unpleasant stimulus. Omission training involves not providing a desired stimulus, which is also different from the scenario described.",
