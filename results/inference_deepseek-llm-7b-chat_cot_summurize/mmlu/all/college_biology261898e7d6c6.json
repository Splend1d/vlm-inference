Disruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the metapopulation\n\nGene flow between populations can result in a disruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the metapopulation. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium refers to the condition where allele and gene frequencies remain constant over time in a population. Gene flow can cause allele and genotype frequencies to change, leading to a disruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.",
