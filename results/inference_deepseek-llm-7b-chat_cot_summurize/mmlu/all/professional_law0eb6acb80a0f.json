The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison.

The defendant's attorney objects to this, as they believe it would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.\n\nThe trial judge should consider the purpose of demonstrative evidence and whether it is non-objectionable. According to the Federal Rules of Evidence, demonstrative evidence is non-objectionable if it is not highly prejudicial. In this case, the judge should permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence to help the jury better understand the facial resemblances between the child and the reputed father.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the judge should not prevent the child from being exhibited solely because it would be highly prejudicial. The judge should weigh the prejudicial effect against the probative value of the evidence.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the child's exhibit does not fall under the hearsay exception of pedigree. Pedigree evidence is used to prove family relationships, but the baby's exhibit is not related to her pedigree.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the judge should not permit the child to be exhibited solely because it is self-serving to the complainant. The judge should consider the purpose of the evidence and whether it is non-objectionable.",
