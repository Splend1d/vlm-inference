Aquinas, a 13th-century philosopher, believed that prudence was a cardinal virtue and the first of the four virtues of practical wisdom. He believed that acts of prudence involve making judgments about the right course of action in a given situation, taking into account the consequences of one's actions and the good of oneself and others.\n\nAquinas believed that the first step in the act of prudence is the recognition of one's own abilities and limitations. This is followed by the consideration of the potential outcomes of one's actions, including the possible good and bad consequences. Based on this analysis, the prudent person then chooses the action that will most likely lead to the best overall outcome, while also considering the good of oneself and others.\n\nTherefore, Aquinas's view on acts of prudence is not solely about matters of pleasure, desire, piety, or moral virtue. Rather, it is a complex process that involves practical wisdom, judgment, and the consideration of multiple factors in order to make the best decision for oneself and others.",
