The reserve requirement is 10 percent, which means that banks must hold 10 percent of their deposits as reserves.\n2. The FED sells $29 million worth of government securities.\n3. To calculate the change in the reserve requirement, we need to find the percentage change in the money supply. Since the reserve requirement is 10 percent, a 1 percent change in the money supply will result in a 10 percent change in the reserve requirement. Therefore, a 1 percent change in the money supply will result in a 10 percent change in the reserve requirement.\n4. To calculate the change in the money supply, we need to find the percentage change in the value of the securities sold. Since the FED sells $29 million worth of government securities, a 1 percent change in the value of these securities will result in a $290,000 change in the value of the securities. Therefore, a 1 percent change in the value of the securities will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply.\n5. To calculate the change in the reserve requirement, we need to multiply the percentage change in the money supply by the percentage change in the value of the securities. Since a 1 percent change in the value of the securities will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply, a 1 percent change in the value of the securities will result in a 1 percent change in the reserve requirement.\n6. To calculate the change in the money supply, we need to multiply the percentage change in the money supply by the initial money supply. Since a 1 percent change in the money supply will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply, a 1 percent change in the money supply will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply.\n7. To calculate the total change in the money supply, we need to add the change in the reserve requirement to the change in the money supply. Since a 1 percent change in the reserve requirement will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply, a 1 percent change in the reserve requirement will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply.\n8. To calculate the final answer, we need to add the change in the money supply to the initial money supply. Since a 1 percent change in the money supply will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply, a 1 percent change in the money supply will result in a 1 percent change in the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the money supply can increase by $2.9 million.\n\n$\\boxed{A}$.",
