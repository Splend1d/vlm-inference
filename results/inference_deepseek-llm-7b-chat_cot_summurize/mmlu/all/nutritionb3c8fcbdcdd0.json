Basal metabolic rate\nB. Thermic effect of food\nC. Adaptive thermogenesis\nD. Thermal balance\n\nassistant:The body's adjustment of heat production to changes in the plane of nutrition (under- or over-nutrition) and to minimize energy imbalance is known as adaptive thermogenesis. This is option C.\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis is a process by which the body adjusts its metabolic rate in response to changes in nutrition. When the body is under-nourished, it will slow down its metabolic rate to conserve energy. This is known as starvation mode. Conversely, when the body is over-nourished, it will increase its metabolic rate to burn off excess energy. This is known as fat adaptation.\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis is important for maintaining energy balance and preventing excessive weight gain or loss. It is also a key factor in the regulation of body temperature, as the body will adjust its metabolic rate to maintain a stable internal temperature.\n\nBasal metabolic rate (option A) is the minimum amount of energy the body needs to function at rest. Thermic effect of food (option B) is the increase in body temperature that occurs after eating, as the body digests and absorbs nutrients. Thermal balance (option D) refers to the body's ability to maintain a stable internal temperature in response to changes in the external environment.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option C: Adaptive thermogenesis.",
