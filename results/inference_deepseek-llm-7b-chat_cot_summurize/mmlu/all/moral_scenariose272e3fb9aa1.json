Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is using a bra to get laughs, which may be considered morally wrong if it involves taking advantage of their parents or using them in an inappropriate way. However, the action itself is not clearly morally wrong in general.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character likes to barter at the bazaar because it's fun to negotiate. This action is not morally wrong and is actually a common and acceptable practice in many cultures.",
