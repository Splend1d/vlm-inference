The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples\n\nassistant:To determine the unrestricted residual sum of squares (RSS) for the given regression model, we need to calculate the RSS for both sub-samples and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's define the sub-sample regressions:\n\n1. Sub-sample 1: Observations 1 to 100\n2. Sub-sample 2: Observations 101 to 200\n\nNow, let's calculate the RSS for each sub-sample:\n\n1. RSS for Sub-sample 1:\n$y_1 = \\beta_1 + u_1$\n$y_2 = \\beta_1 + u_2$\n...\n$y_100 = \\beta_1 + u_{100}$\n\n2. RSS for Sub-sample 2:\n$y_{101} = \\beta_1 + u_{101}$\n$y_{102} = \\beta_1 + u_{102}$\n...\n$y_{200} = \\beta_1 + u_{200}$\n\nNow, we need to calculate the sum of squares for each sub-sample:\n\n1. RSS for Sub-sample 1:\n$RSS_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (y_i - \\beta_1 - u_i)^2$\n\n2. RSS for Sub-sample 2:\n$RSS_2 = \\sum_{i=101}^{200} (y_i - \\beta_1 - u_i)^2$\n\nFinally, we sum up the RSS for both sub-samples to get the unrestricted RSS:\n\n$RSS = RSS_1 + RSS_2$\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{(D) The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples}}$",
