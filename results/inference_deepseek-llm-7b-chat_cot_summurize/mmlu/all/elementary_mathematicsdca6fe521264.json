What was the ratio of the number of pears to the number of apples in the fruit salad?\n\nA. 1:03\nB. 1:04\nC. 1:06\nD. 1:09\n\nassistant:To find the ratio of the number of pears to the number of apples, we can divide the number of pears by the number of apples.\n\nNumber of pears: 3\nNumber of apples: 9\n\nThe ratio is: 3/9\n\nTo simplify the ratio, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3.\n\n3/9 \ufffd 3/3 = (3/3) / (9/9) = 1/3\n\nSo the ratio of the number of pears to the number of apples is 1:3.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 1:03.",
