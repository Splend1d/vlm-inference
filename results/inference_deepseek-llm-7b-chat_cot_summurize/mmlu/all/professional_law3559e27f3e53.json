She was not aware that the city council had recently passed a law prohibiting the sale of cats and dogs from a retail pet store. The statute had a provision that allowed the pet store to give space to a non-profit humane society to adopt animals from the pet store. The owner sued the city in federal court, claiming a violation of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court used the rational basis test to conclude that the statute served a legitimate state interest and was enforceable. The pet store owner appealed the decision. Will the appellate court likely affirm the decision of the lower court?\n\nA. Yes, because the pet store owner was not treated differently than any other pet store owner.\nB. Yes, because the correct test requires only that the law in question will satisfy any set of facts that could establish a rational basis for achieving legitimate government ends.\nC. No, the pet store owner has a vested constitutional right to earn a living and that is unreasonably precluded by the law in question.\nD. No, because this ordinance is so invidiously discriminatory that it must pass the strict scrutiny test, which it fails to do.\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Yes, because the correct test requires only that the law in question will satisfy any set of facts that could establish a rational basis for achieving legitimate government ends.\n\nThe pet store owner's claim that the statute is a violation of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment is based on the assumption that the statute is unfairly targeting her business. However, the lower court used the rational basis test, which is an appropriate standard for determining the constitutionality of laws that are not clearly arbitrary or capricious.\n\nThe rational basis test requires that a law be supported by some rational basis in order to be valid. In this case, the court found that the statute served a legitimate state interest in promoting animal welfare and adoption, and that the provision allowing the pet store to work with a non-profit humane society was a reasonable way to achieve that goal. The court also found that the statute was not invidiously discriminatory, as the owner claims.\n\nThe appellate court is likely to affirm the decision of the lower court because the statute passes the rational basis test, and the owner has not presented any evidence that would establish a rational basis for finding the statute unconstitutional. The fact that the pet store owner is being treated differently than other pet store owners does not necessarily mean that the statute is unconstitutional. The owner may have a valid claim if she can show that the statute is discriminatory or arbitrary, but in this case, she has not provided any such evidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Yes, because the correct test requires only that the law in question will satisfy any set of facts that could establish a rational basis for achieving legitimate government ends.",
