Board of Education\n\nassistant:The Supreme Court decision that established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine of state-sponsored racial segregation was in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation of the races, as long as it does not deny a person equal rights, is constitutional. This decision was overturned in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, which declared segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional.",
