Concealment of a deadly weapon.\n\nassistant:B. Murder.\n\nThe defendant gave his friend his gun, and the friend shot the victim to death. This is enough to be convicted of murder, even though the defendant did not pull the trigger himself. The other options are not as serious as murder. Attempted murder is when someone tries to commit murder but fails. Assault with a deadly weapon is when someone threatens someone else with a deadly weapon. Concealment of a deadly weapon is when someone hides a deadly weapon.",
