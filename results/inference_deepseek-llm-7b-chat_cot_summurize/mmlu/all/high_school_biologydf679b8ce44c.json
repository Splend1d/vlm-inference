Which of the following endocrine glands produces GnRH?\n\nA. Anterior pituitary\nB. Posterior pituitary\nC. Hypothalamus\nD. Pineal gland\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Hypothalamus.\n\nThe GnRH is produced in the hypothalamus, which is a region in the brain that acts as a link between the nervous system and endocrine system. GnRH then travels to the anterior pituitary gland, where it stimulates the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones then regulate the menstrual cycle and ovulation in females, as well as sperm production in males.",
