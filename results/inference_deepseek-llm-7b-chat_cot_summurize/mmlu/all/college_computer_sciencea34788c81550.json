A height-balanced binary search tree is a special type of binary search tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most 1.\n\nI. Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nII. Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nIII. Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.\n\nIV. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nA binary search tree with an unbalanced left subtree and a right subtree with height k, where k > 1, would be considered height-unbalanced. In such a tree, the height of the tree would not be logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nTherefore, only I and III are true statements about a height-balanced binary search tree.\nThe answer is A.
