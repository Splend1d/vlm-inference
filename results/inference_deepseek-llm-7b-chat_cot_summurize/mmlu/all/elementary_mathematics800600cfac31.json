What is the probability he rolls a three?\n\nA. 6-Jan\nB. 5-Jan\nC. 3-Jan\nD. 2-Jan\n\nassistant:To find the probability of rolling a three on a six-sided cube, you need to divide the number of successful outcomes (rolling a three) by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nThere are 2 successful outcomes (rolling a three or a six) and 6 possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a three is:\n\n2 successful outcomes / 6 possible outcomes = 1/3 or approximately 0.3333\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. 3-Jan.",
