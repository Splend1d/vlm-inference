Geographic isolation: Two populations of a species become separated by a geographical barrier, such as a body of water or a mountain range.\n2. Reproductive isolation: As the two populations become isolated from each other, they also become reproductively isolated from one another. This means that individuals from one population are unable to mate with individuals from the other population.\n3. Differential changes in allele frequencies: Over time, the populations that are isolated from each other will begin to undergo genetic changes. These changes will occur at a faster rate in the population that is more isolated from the other population.\n4. Reproductive barriers: As the genetic differences between the two populations increase, the reproductive barriers between them will also increase. This means that individuals from one population will be less likely to mate with individuals from the other population.\n5. New species: As the genetic differences between the two populations continue to increase and the reproductive barriers between them remain high, the two populations will eventually split into two distinct species.\n\nTherefore, the process of allopatric speciation can be summarized as: geographic isolation \u2192 reproductive isolation \u2192 differential changes in allele frequencies \u2192 reproductive barriers \u2192 new species.
