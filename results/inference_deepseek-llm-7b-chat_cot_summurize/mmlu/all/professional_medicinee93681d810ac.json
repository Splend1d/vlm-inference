Which of the following best describes this mass?\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\n\nassistant:The mass is likely a granulosa tumor, as it has characteristics consistent with a tumor of the ovaries. This would explain the increased testosterone concentration, clitoral enlargement, and the 12-cm ovarian mass. It is important for the woman to have further testing and evaluation to determine the best course of treatment.",
