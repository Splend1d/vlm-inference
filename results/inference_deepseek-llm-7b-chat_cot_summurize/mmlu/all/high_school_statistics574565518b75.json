A third group that randomly hears either classical or light rock music each day\nC. A third group that hears day-long R & B music\nD. A third group that hears classical music every morning and light rock every afternoon\n\nassistant:To determine the best control group for this study, we should consider the factors that are expected to affect the piecework output of the workers. Since the goal is to study the effect of music on output, it would be ideal to have a group that is exposed to the same type of music as the experimental groups (i.e., classical or light rock).\n\nOption A, a group with no music, would not be a suitable control since it would not provide any information about the impact of music on output. Option B, a random assignment of music types, would also not be suitable as it could introduce additional variables that could confound the results. Option C, a group listening to R&B music, is not relevant to the experimental groups since it does not align with the types of music being studied.\n\nOption D, a group that listens to classical music in the morning and light rock music in the afternoon, could be a suitable control group. This group would be exposed to the same types of music as the experimental groups, but in different durations. This would allow for a comparison between the two experimental groups, while still providing a control group that can help isolate the effects of music on output.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. A third group that hears classical music in the morning and light rock music in the afternoon.",
