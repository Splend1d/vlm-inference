Scattering occurs when light interacts with small particles in the water, such as water molecules or dissolved substances. This process causes the light to be scattered in all directions, leading to the visible blue and green colors that we see in the ocean.\n\nScattering can also occur when light interacts with the air-water interface, such as when light enters the water from above. However, this process is less important for the overall color of the ocean water, as it is typically less intense than scattering within the water itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) scattered.",
