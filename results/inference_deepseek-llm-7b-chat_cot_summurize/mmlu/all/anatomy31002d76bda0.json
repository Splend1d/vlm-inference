Loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. A malignant tumor can damage the glossopharyngeal nerve, which affects the taste and somaesthetic sensations on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. Loss of somaesthetic sensation: Somaesthetic sensation refers to the feeling of touch, not taste.\nC. Loss of taste and somaesthetic sensation over the posterior third of the tongue: This option is incorrect because it refers to the posterior third of the tongue, not the anterior two-thirds.\nD. Paralysis of the muscles of the tongue: This option is incorrect because the question states that the patient will experience a loss of taste, not paralysis of the tongue muscles.",
