Cholesterol uptake involves all of the following EXCEPT\n\nA. cell-surface receptors\nB. adhesion plaques\nC. endosome formation\nD. receptor-mediated endocytosis\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the process of cellular uptake of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a lipid that is transported in the bloodstream by low-density lipoproteins (LDL). It is internalized into cells through a process called endocytosis.\n\n2. Endocytosis is a process by which cells engulf particles or vesicles to bring them inside the cell. It can be classified into two types: receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis.\n\n3. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a type of endocytosis where the cell membrane forms vesicles around the particle to be internalized, and the vesicles then move into the cell and fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the particle inside the cell.\n\n4. The question asks for the process that occurs in cholesterol uptake but is NOT involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n\n5. The answer is D. Receptor-mediated endocytosis, as it is the process involved in cholesterol uptake.\n\nIn summary, the process that occurs in cholesterol uptake but is NOT involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis is receptor-mediated endocytosis.",
