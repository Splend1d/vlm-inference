What amount of the above costs should be expensed as research and development costs?\n\nA. $40,000\nB. $100,000\nC. $140,000\nD. 145000\n\nassistant:To determine which costs should be expensed as research and development (R&D) costs, we need to identify if the costs are directly related to the development of a new or improved product, process, or software.\n\n1. Labor and material costs incurred in producing a prototype: These costs are directly related to the development of Product X, as they are necessary to create the prototype.\n2. Cost of testing the prototype: This cost is also directly related to the development of Product X, as it is necessary to test the prototype to ensure its functionality and quality.\n3. Legal costs to file a patent: While this cost is related to protecting the intellectual property of Product X, it is not directly related to the development of the product itself.\n\nTherefore, we can exclude the legal costs from the R&D costs. The R&D costs would be the sum of the labor and material costs incurred in producing the prototype ($100,000) and the cost of testing the prototype ($40,000).\n\nR&D costs = Labor and material costs + Cost of testing\nR&D costs = $100,000 + $40,000\nR&D costs = $140,000\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. $140,000.",
