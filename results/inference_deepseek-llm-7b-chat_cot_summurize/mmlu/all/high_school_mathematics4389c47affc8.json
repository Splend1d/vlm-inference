How many distinct symbols can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes?\n\nA. 3\nB. 4680\nC. 30\nD. 10\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. For 1 dot or dash, there are 2 possibilities (either a dot or a dash).\n2. For 2 dots or dashes, there are 2 possibilities for the first symbol (dot or dash) and 2 possibilities for the second symbol (dot or dash). This gives us a total of 2 * 2 = 4 possibilities.\n3. For 3 dots or dashes, there are 2 possibilities for the first symbol, 2 possibilities for the second symbol, and 2 possibilities for the third symbol. This gives us a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possibilities.\n4. For 4 dots or dashes, there are 2 possibilities for each of the four symbols. This gives us a total of 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16 possibilities.\n\nNow, we sum up the possibilities for each case:\n1 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 distinct symbols that can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes.
