Spanish colonists enslaved native American populations outright.\n\nThe system of labor described in the first passage, where Indian workers were forced to work in the mercury mine, was not the result of Spanish colonists enslaving native American populations outright. Instead, it was a result of Spanish authorities adapting local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes.\n\nThe passage describes how the Spanish king, through a system of tribute, sent monetary payments to the Peruvian authorities to pay for the labor of the native Indians working in the mercury mine. This system was not based on slavery, but rather on the use of the local Indian population for labor purposes. The Indian workers were not enslaved, but rather were obligated to work under the terms of the tribute system.\n\nThe second option, B. Spain refused to purchase slaves from Africa, relying instead on native American labor, is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the use of African slaves.\n\nOption C, Spanish authorities adapted local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes, is the correct answer. The passage describes how the Spanish authorities used the local Indian population for labor purposes, adapting the existing system of tribute to pay for the labor of the Indians in the mercury mine.\n\nOption D, Spanish landowners came to depend heavily on plantation monoculture, is not relevant to the system of labor described in the passage. The passage does not mention anything about plantation monoculture or Spanish landowners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{C}$",
