Flat on a firm surface.\n\nPerforming CPR on a flat, firm surface is the most appropriate position for delivering chest compressions that are both consistent and effective in delivering adequate blood flow to the heart. Additionally, maintaining a stable and firm surface can also help to prevent injury to the rescuer and the patient during CPR.",
