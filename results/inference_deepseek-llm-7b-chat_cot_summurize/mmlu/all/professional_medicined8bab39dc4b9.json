Staphylococcus aureus\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Escherichia coli.\n\nA perforated appendix can lead to peritonitis, which is an infection of the peritoneal cavity. The most common cause of peritonitis is E. coli, which can be found in the gut and cause an infection when it enters the peritoneal cavity. The other options are not commonly associated with peritonitis.",
