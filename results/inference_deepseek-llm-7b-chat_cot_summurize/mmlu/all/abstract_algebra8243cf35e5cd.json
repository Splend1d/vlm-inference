False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian.\nThis statement is false. A group of order p^2 where p is prime can be non-Abelian. An example of such a group is the quaternion group of order 8, which is a group of order 8^2.\n\nStatement 2: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.\nThis statement is true. This is a well-known result in group theory, known as the Sylow theorems. The statement says that if H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and G is a group of order p^n, then H is a normal subgroup of G if and only if the index [G : H] = p^k for some k.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B.
