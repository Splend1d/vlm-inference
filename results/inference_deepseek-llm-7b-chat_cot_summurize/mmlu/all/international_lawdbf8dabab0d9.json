An agreement in 1215 between the King and his barons, which guaranteed certain protections for subjects\n\nThe Magna Carta was an important document signed in 1215 by King John of England and his barons. It set a number of protections for subjects, including the right to a fair trial, protection against arbitrary arrest, and the right to petition the King. The Magna Carta is considered one of the foundations of the modern concept of constitutional government and human rights.\n\nA. An agreement in 1689 which guaranteed freedom of speech in Parliament: This is incorrect. The English Bill of Rights, signed in 1689, is the document that guaranteed freedom of speech in Parliament.\n\nC. A constitutional document in the 19th century guaranteeing the right to vote: This is incorrect. The right to vote in England was not guaranteed until the Representation of the People Act of 1918.\n\nD. A document setting a complete Bill of Rights for England: This is incorrect. While the Magna Carta did set some protections for subjects, it did not create a complete Bill of Rights for England. The English Bill of Rights, signed in 1689, is the document that established the rights and freedoms of English subjects.",
