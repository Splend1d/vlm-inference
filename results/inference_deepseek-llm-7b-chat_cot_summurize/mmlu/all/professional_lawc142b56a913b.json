The businessman is responsible for ensuring that the construction site is safe for pedestrians to pass by, as it is located along a public sidewalk. The negligence of the builder in constructing the wall with thinly cut wood and failing to properly secure it to the sidewalk makes it a dangerous condition. As a result, the businessman can be held liable for the pedestrian's injuries.",
