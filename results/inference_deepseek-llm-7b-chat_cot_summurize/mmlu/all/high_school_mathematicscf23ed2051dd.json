Given the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$, find the area of the rectangle.\n\nA. 2500\nB. 2\nC. 50\nD. 25\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length and width of the rectangle, and then use the formula for the area of a rectangle: length \u00d7 width.\n\nFirst, let's denote the length as L and the width as W. We are given that L = 2W.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nL^2 + W^2 = D^2\n\nSince the length of the diagonal (D) is given as 5\u221a5, we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n(2W)^2 + W^2 = (5\u221a5)^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4W^2 + W^2 = 250\u221a5\n\nCombining the terms, we have:\n\n5W^2 = 250\u221a5\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nW^2 = 50\u221a5\n\nTo find W, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nW = \u221a(50\u221a5)\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length using the equation L = 2W:\n\nL = 2\u221a(50\u221a5)\n\nNow we can find the area of the rectangle:\n\nArea = L \u00d7 W\nArea = 2\u221a(50\u221a5) \u00d7 \u221a(50\u221a5)\nArea = 2\u221a(50\u221a5) \u00d7 \u221a(50\u221a5)\nArea = 2 \u00d7 50\u221a5\nArea = 100\u221a5\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 100\u221a5, so the correct answer is:\n\nC. 50",
