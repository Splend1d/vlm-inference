Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.\nD. Racial superiority confers responsibility to the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations.\n\nassistant:Beveridge employs the rationale that governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations. This is evident in his argument that the United States and Europe have a responsibility to govern less developed nations, stating that \"the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them.\" This argument is not about racial superiority, but rather about the benefits of governing territories for both European and nonwhite nations. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nA. The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas: This is not a rationale employed by Beveridge in the passage. He does not mention the closing of the western frontier or the need to expand territory.\n\nC. Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations: This is not a rationale employed by Beveridge in the passage. He does not discuss a moral duty, but rather focuses on the benefits of governing territories for both European and nonwhite nations.\n\nD. Racial superiority confers responsibility to the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations: This is not a rationale employed by Beveridge in the passage. He does not mention racial superiority or the responsibility of the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations.",
