This can have several effects on aggregate demand, output, and the price level.\n\n1. Nominal Interest Rate: A contractionary monetary policy will cause the nominal interest rate to increase. This is because the central bank is selling securities in the open market, which increases the supply of money and decreases the demand for money. This leads to a higher interest rate, as people are willing to pay more to borrow money.\n\n2. Aggregate Demand: A contractionary monetary policy will decrease aggregate demand. This is because a higher interest rate increases the cost of borrowing, which reduces consumer and business spending. Additionally, a higher interest rate reduces the incentive for investment, as the returns on investment are lower.\n\n3. Output: A contractionary monetary policy will decrease output. This is because a decrease in aggregate demand reduces the total amount of goods and services produced by firms. As firms produce fewer goods and services, unemployment may increase, as there are more people looking for work than there are jobs available.\n\n4. Price Level: A contractionary monetary policy will decrease the price level. This is because a decrease in aggregate demand reduces the amount of money in circulation. When there is less money in circulation, prices tend to fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease, as a contractionary monetary policy will cause the nominal interest rate, aggregate demand, output, and price level to decrease.",
