It focuses on the relationship between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) and the subsequent conditioned response (CR). The model posits that the CS and US must be present for the CR to occur, and that the CR will only occur if the CS is followed by the US. This perspective is concerned with observable behavior and the learning process.",
