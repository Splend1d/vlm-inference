This occurs when there is a decrease in overall demand for goods and services, causing prices to rise and economic growth to slow. A leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve would actually lead to stagflation, as it would increase production costs and reduce supply, causing prices to rise even further. A rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve would lead to inflation, not stagflation, as it would increase production and reduce prices.",
