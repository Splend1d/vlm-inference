Despite that knowledge, the hospital issued him an unrestricted weekend pass. When he got out he shot and killed his wife. The man's children sued the hospital for negligence. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss mainly because there was no privity with the decedent and no duty owed to her. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the hospital is strictly liable for releasing patients who it knows or should know represent an unreasonable danger to third persons.\nB. No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an in-patient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.\nC.

Yes, because the intervening acts of third parties are unforeseeable and cannot give rise to liability.\n\nassistant:The court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss, based on the arguments provided. The hospital is not strictly liable for releasing the man with a known history of harm, as there is no clear duty to control the patient's conduct. Additionally, the special relationship and control between the doctor and the patient do not mandate due care to prevent foreseeable danger to others. The intervening acts of third parties are also unforeseeable and cannot give rise to liability. The hospital's motion to dismiss should be granted.",
