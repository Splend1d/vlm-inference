Aggression vs. pacifism\nB. Competency vs. failure\nC. Insurgence vs. retreat\nD. Appeasement vs. provocation\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Competency vs. failure.\n\nDuring the Vietnam conflict, President Lyndon Johnson was in office from 1963 to 1969. He took a more aggressive approach to the conflict, increasing the number of American troops and resources being used in the war. He also expanded the conflict by sending American troops into Cambodia and Laos. Johnson's approach was characterized by a strong commitment to winning the war and a belief in the domino theory, which held that if Vietnam fell to communism, other countries in the region would also fall to communism.\n\nOn the other hand, Richard Nixon was in office from 1969 to 1974. He took a different approach to the conflict, which can be characterized as a retreat from the aggressive tactics of Johnson. Nixon pursued a policy of Vietnamization, which involved training and arming the South Vietnamese military to take over more of the fighting, while simultaneously withdrawing American troops. His approach was characterized by a greater willingness to negotiate with the North Vietnamese and a recognition that the costs of the war were becoming too great for the United States to bear.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the approaches of Presidents Johnson and Nixon to the Vietnam conflict can be best characterized as competency (Johnson's aggressive approach) vs. failure (Nixon's retreat from the conflict).",
