A private individual from discriminating against a person based on race.\nB. A private individual from discriminating against a person based on nationality.\nC. A state official from discriminating against a person based on race.\nD. A federal official from discriminating against a person based on nationality.\n\nassistant:The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects citizens from discrimination based on certain characteristics, such as race and nationality. The enabling clause of the Fourteenth Amendment allows states to pass laws that further protect citizens from discrimination.\n\nUnder this clause, a state would most likely be able to regulate option A, which involves a private individual discriminating against a person based on race. This is because the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination based on race, and a state could pass laws to enforce this prohibition.\n\nOption C, which involves a state official discriminating against a person based on race, could also be regulated by a state. However, this is not the most likely scenario, as state officials are typically subject to the same protections against discrimination as private individuals.\n\nOption D, which involves a federal official discriminating against a person based on nationality, is not a scenario that would likely be regulated by a state under the enabling clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is because the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state and local governments, not to the federal government.\n\nOption B, which involves a private individual discriminating against a person based on nationality, is also not a scenario that would likely be regulated by a state under the enabling clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is because the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination based on race, not nationality.\n\nIn summary, a state would most likely be able to regulate option A, which involves a private individual discriminating against a person based on race.",
