Any of these\n\nassistant:The resultant of two vectors can be found by adding their magnitudes and subtracting their angle. The angle can be found using the dot product of the two vectors. The dot product of two vectors a and b is given by a.b. If the angle between the two vectors is \u03b8, then the magnitude of the resultant is |a| + |b|cos(\u03b8), and the angle between the resultant and the first vector is \u03b8 - arctan(b/a).\n\nThe first vector has a magnitude of 3 N, and the second vector has a magnitude of 4 N. The dot product of the two vectors is given by:\n\na.b = (3)(4) = 12\n\nThe angle between the two vectors is \u03b8 = arctan((b/a)) = arctan(4/3)\n\n\u03b8 - arctan(4/3) = 0\n\nSince the angle between the resultant and the first vector is 0, the resultant is parallel to the first vector. Therefore, the resultant is 3 N.\n\nThe answer is A. 0 N.",
