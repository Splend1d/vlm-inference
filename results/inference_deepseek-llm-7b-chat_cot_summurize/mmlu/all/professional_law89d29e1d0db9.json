The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.\n\nThis statement best supports the carpenter's position because it implies that the general contractor has an obligation to consider the bids of all bidders who were involved in the calculation of their main bid. In this case, the carpenter's bid was the lowest and therefore should be awarded the carpentry subcontract. The general contractor's agreement to give the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter only if their bid was successful is a conditional promise, and the carpenter detrimentally relied on this promise by incurring time and expense in preparing their bid. Therefore, the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.",
