She has 60 female friends and 50 male friends and belongs to 5 social groups. If 30% of her female friends live in town and 40% of her male friends live in town, how many out-of-town friends does she have on the social networking site?\n\nA. 38\nB. 72\nC. 110\nD. 360\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the number of friends living in town and then subtract that from the total number of friends to find the number of out-of-town friends.\n\nMorgan has 60 female friends and 30% of them live in town, so:\n60 friends * 0.30 = 18 friends living in town.\n\nMorgan also has 50 male friends and 40% of them live in town, so:\n50 friends * 0.40 = 20 friends living in town.\n\nTo find the total number of friends living in town, we add the number of female friends living in town and the number of male friends living in town:\n18 friends + 20 friends = 38 friends living in town.\n\nMorgan has a total of 60 female friends + 50 male friends = 110 friends.\n\nTo find the number of out-of-town friends, we subtract the number of friends living in town from the total number of friends:\n110 friends - 38 friends = 72 out-of-town friends.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 72 out-of-town friends.",
