All of the options given.\n\nWhen epidemiologists judge the evidence to establish possible causes of a health outcome, they take into account various factors such as the estimated strength of the association between an exposure and the outcome (A), the evidence that the exposure of interest has appeared before the outcome (B), and evidence showing that reductions in the exposure level will reverse the risk of the outcome (C). This allows them to make a comprehensive and well-informed judgement on the possible causes of the health outcome.",
