Gamma rays are a type of high-energy radiation that are produced when an atomic nucleus decays or when particles collide. Gamma rays have very high frequencies and are not easily absorbed by matter, which is why they are used in medical imaging and other applications. Microwaves, ultraviolet radiation, and visible light are all forms of electromagnetic radiation, but they have different properties and are not typically associated with nuclear radiation.",
