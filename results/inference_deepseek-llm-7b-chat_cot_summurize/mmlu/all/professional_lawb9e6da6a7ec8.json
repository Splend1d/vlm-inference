Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer. This is because the man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise, and since the man revoked his offer before the mechanic had a chance to return the promise, no contract was formed. This is because the man's offer was revocable and could be withdrawn at any time before acceptance. Therefore, the mechanic could not rely on the man's offer and the man's revocation of the offer did not create a binding contract.",
