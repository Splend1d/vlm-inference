During conjugation, the DNA is transferred from one bacterium to the other, allowing for the exchange of genetic information.\n\nSpecialized transduction is a type of horizontal gene transfer that occurs between two or more cells, but it is not the specific process of transferring DNA between two bacterial cells connected by sex pili. Generalized transduction is a term used to describe the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another without the involvement of a specialized transducing device, but it does not specifically refer to the process of transferring DNA between two bacterial cells connected by sex pili. Transformation is a type of genetic transformation that occurs when a plasmid containing foreign DNA is introduced into a bacterial cell, but it does not specifically refer to the process of transferring DNA between two bacterial cells connected by sex pili.",
