A ball is drawn at random from the bin. If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars. If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?\n\nA. 6\nB. 12\nC. 3\nD. 4\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we can use the concept of expected value. Let $x$ be the probability of drawing a green ball. Then, the expected value is given by:\n\n$E = x \\cdot 2 + (1-x) \\cdot (-2) = 0.50$\n\nWe can solve for $x$ by substituting the expected value equation into the equation for the expected value:\n\n$x \\cdot 2 + (1-x) \\cdot (-2) = 0.50$\n\n$2x - 2(1-x) = 0.50$\n\n$2x - 2 + 2x = 0.50$\n\n$4x = 2.50$\n\n$x = 0.50$\n\nNow that we have the probability of drawing a green ball, we can find the value of $k$. Since there are 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls, the probability of drawing a green ball is $\\frac{5}{5+k}$. We can substitute this into the equation for the expected value:\n\n$\\frac{5}{5+k} \\cdot 2 + (1-\\frac{5}{5+k}) \\cdot (-2) = 0.50$\n\n$10 - \\frac{10}{5+k} - 2k = 0.50$\n\n$2k + \\frac{10}{5+k} = 1.50$\n\n$2k = 1.50 - \\frac{10}{5+k}$\n\n$k = \\frac{3(1.50 - \\frac{10}{5+k})}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5+k}}{2}$\n\n$k = \\frac{4.50 - \\frac{15}{5",
