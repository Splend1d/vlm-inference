The family must prove that the patient would not have died if given 18. 5 milligrams of the drug.\n\nassistant:The family must prove that the patient would not have died if given 18.5 milligrams of the drug. This is because the dosage of the drug that was administered to the patient was 185 milligrams, which is much higher than the prescribed dosage of 18.5 milligrams. Therefore, the family needs to show that the mistake in dosage was the direct cause of the patient's death.",
