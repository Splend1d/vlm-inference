These codes are justified by the potential harm that may result from certain types of speech, such as offensive language or hate speech.\n\nAltman's argument is that codes that take account of both causal and expressive harm have the best prospects for success. Causal harm refers to the direct harm caused by the content of speech, such as inciting violence or discrimination. Expressive harm, on the other hand, refers to the harm caused by limiting or restricting speech, such as the violation of freedom of speech.\n\nAltman argues that codes that take account of both types of harm are the most effective because they balance the need to protect against harm caused by speech with the need to protect freedom of speech. Codes that only focus on one type of harm may not be effective in preventing harm, while codes that overly restrict speech may also be harmful in their own right.\n\nTherefore, Altman's justification of speech codes that take account of both causal and expressive harm are considered the best prospects for success.",
