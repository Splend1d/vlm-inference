Cowper's gland\nB. Prostate gland\nC. Bartholin glands\nD. Adrenal gland\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Bartholin glands.\n\nBefore the Masters and Johnson research, it was thought that vaginal lubrication was due to secretions of the Bartholin glands. The Bartholin glands are two small glands located on each side of the vaginal opening, and they secrete a clear, viscous fluid that helps to keep the vagina lubricated.\n\nIt's worth noting that Cowper's gland, Prostate gland, and Adrenal gland are also involved in the production of fluids in the body, but they do not play a direct role in vaginal lubrication. Cowper's gland produces the fluid that is mixed with sperm during ejaculation, Prostate gland produces the fluid that makes up part of semen, and Adrenal gland produces hormones that regulate a wide variety of functions in the body.",
