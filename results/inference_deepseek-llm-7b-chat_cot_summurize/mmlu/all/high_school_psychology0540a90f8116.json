It receives input from various sensory systems, including the somatosensory cortex, which processes touch and pain sensations, and the occipital lobes, which process visual information. However, the primary regulators of hunger and eating are the hypothalamus, which integrates sensory information and other signals to regulate appetite and control eating behavior.",
