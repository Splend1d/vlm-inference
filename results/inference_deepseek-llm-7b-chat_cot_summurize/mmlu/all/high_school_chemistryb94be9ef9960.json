Dissolve the copper penny in acid, precipitate the hydroxide, and heat in a Bunsen burner flame to make the oxide.\n\nassistant:To determine the easiest way to burn a copper penny, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Hold the copper penny with crucible tongs, and heat strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner.\nThis method requires the user to handle the penny carefully, which may not be easy for everyone, and the Bunsen burner may not provide enough heat to burn the penny easily.\n\nB. Use the method in (A), but use an oxyacetylene torch to reach a higher temperature.\nThis method may be more efficient in reaching a high temperature, but it also requires the use of a potentially dangerous oxyacetylene torch, which could pose a safety risk.\n\nC. Grind the copper penny into very small, dust-sized particles, and spray the particles into a Bunsen burner flame.\nThis method involves using a Bunsen burner, which is relatively safe, and grinding the penny into dust allows for easier burning. However, it may be time-consuming and messy.\n\nD. Dissolve the copper penny in acid, precipitate the hydroxide, and heat in a Bunsen burner flame to make the oxide.\nThis method involves using a Bunsen burner and potentially dangerous chemicals, which could pose a safety risk. It also requires a longer process of dissolving and heating.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C seems to be the easiest way to burn a copper penny, as it requires a Bunsen burner and a relatively simple process, although it might be time-consuming and messy.",
