The price will rise and each firm's output will fall as firms exit the industry.\nB. Market equilibrium quantity will increase as firms exit the industry.\nC. Nothing. The industry is currently in long-run equilibrium.\nD. The price will rise to the breakeven point as firms exit the industry.\n\nassistant:The perfectly competitive market has a long-run equilibrium where the price equals the minimum average total cost (MATC). In the long run, if the perfectly competitive price is below the minimum average total cost, firms will exit the industry, leading to a higher price and each firm's output will fall. This is because the remaining firms will be able to charge a higher price for their products, as they are now producing at a higher cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The price will rise and each firm's output will fall as firms exit the industry.",
