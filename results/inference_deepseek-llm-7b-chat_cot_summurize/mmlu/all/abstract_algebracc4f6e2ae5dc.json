A permutation is a rearrangement of the elements of a set. In other words, it is a specific type of cycle. Therefore, every permutation is a cycle.\n\nStatement 2: Every cycle is a permutation.\nThis statement is also true. As mentioned earlier, a cycle is a rearrangement of the elements of a set. This means that every cycle is a permutation.\n\nSo, both statements are true. The correct answer is A. True, True.",
