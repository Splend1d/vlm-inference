If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. I and II only\n\nassistant:This problem involves ring theory and the properties of right ideals in a ring. Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. R is commutative: A ring is commutative if for all a, b in R, ab = ba. However, this property does not necessarily hold for right ideals. For example, consider the ring R = {0, 1} with the operation addition, and let U = {0} be the additive subgroup of R. Since U is a right ideal, it satisfies the given condition. However, R is not commutative in this case (1 + 1 = 0 + 0 = 1). Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nII. R is a division ring: A division ring is a ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. This property is independent of the existence of right ideals. Thus, the existence of two right ideals does not guarantee that R is a division ring.\n\nIII. R is infinite: The size of the set of right ideals does not necessarily determine the size of the ring R. It is possible for R to be infinite even if there are only two right ideals.\n\nBased on the above analysis, none of the statements I, II, or III must be true. The answer is D: I and II only. This means that if R has exactly two right ideals, then it could be a commutative division ring, but it could also be a non-commutative division ring, an infinite ring, or any other type of ring.",
