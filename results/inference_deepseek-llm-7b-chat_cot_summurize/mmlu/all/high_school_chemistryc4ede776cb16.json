The graph of [A] versus time and the graph of ln [A] versus time both give a curved line; however, the graph of 1/[A] versus time and gives a straight line. This implies the rate law is\n\nA. Rate = k[A]\nB. Rate = k[A]^2\nC. Rate = k[A]^0\nD. Rate = k[A]^-1\n\nassistant:The chemist can determine the rate law by analyzing the rate expression for the reaction. The rate expression is the mathematical equation that describes how the concentration of a reactant changes over time.\n\nIn this case, the reaction is A \u2192 2B, and the rate law is the form of the rate expression that relates the reaction rate to the concentrations of the reactants.\n\nThe straight line on the graph of 1/[A] versus time indicates that the rate law is of the form rate = k[A]^n, where n is a positive integer. Since the straight line is not a straight line when n = 0, the correct answer is C. Rate = k[A]^0.",
