The contract assigned $10,000 to the bathroom and $15,000 to the kitchen with the $25,000 total due when all the remodeling was complete.

Charlie in an amount of $10,000 if the court finds the contract divisible and the $10,000 is an equivalent amount for the completed portion of the agreement.\nD. Nancy since Charlie will not complete the contract, he is not entitled to any compensation.\n\nassistant:To determine the likely outcome of the lawsuit, let's analyze the contract and the actions taken by both Charlie and Nancy.\n\n1. The contract allocated $10,000 for the bathroom and $15,000 for the kitchen, with a total of $25,000 due when all remodeling was complete.\n2. Charlie completed the bathroom portion of the contract.\n3. Nancy did not cooperate with Charlie, which led Charlie to refuse to start working on the kitchen.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that:\n\nA. Charlie believes Nancy breached the contract by not cooperating and not completing the entire contract.\n\nB. Charlie completed the bathroom, which is worth $10,000.\n\nC. The contract is divisible, as both parties have not completed their respective portions.\n\nGiven the information, the likely outcome of the lawsuit would be:\n\nC. Charlie would be entitled to $10,000 if the court finds the contract divisible, and the $10,000 represents an equivalent amount for the completed portion of the agreement. This outcome would be based on the fact that Charlie has completed the bathroom, which was worth $10,000, and since the contract is divisible, Nancy would need to pay that amount to Charlie.",
