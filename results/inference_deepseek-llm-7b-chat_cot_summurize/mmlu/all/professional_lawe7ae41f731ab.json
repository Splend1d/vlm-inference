An easement by prescription is created when a person uses another's land for a long enough period of time, typically five or more years, with the owner's implied consent. In this case, the buyer has used the path for several months, which is a relatively short period of time. However, if the buyer can prove that the seller's actions (standing by and watching the buyer clear the path, and then putting a barrier across it) were tantamount to implied consent, then the buyer may be able to establish an easement by prescription. This would depend on the strength of the court's feeling about the use of the path and whether it was reasonably necessary for the buyer's use of her land.",
