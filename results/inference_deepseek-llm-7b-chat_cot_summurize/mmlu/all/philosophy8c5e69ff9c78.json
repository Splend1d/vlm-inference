This is based on Hobbes' political philosophy, which argues that in the state of nature, humans are essentially selfish and prone to conflict. Therefore, to maintain order and avoid conflict, it is necessary for people to submit to a sovereign (a strong leader) who has the power to enforce laws and punish those who disobey. Therefore, disobedience to a sovereign is considered an injustice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. disobedience to a sovereign.",
