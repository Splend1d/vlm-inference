This is a fundamental concept in physics, specifically in electrical engineering, which states that the force between two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance is equal to 1 Faraday (F). \n\n1 F = 1 C/V\n\nTherefore, 1 F is equal to the ratio of 1 Coulomb (C) of charge to 1 Volt (V) of electric potential.",
