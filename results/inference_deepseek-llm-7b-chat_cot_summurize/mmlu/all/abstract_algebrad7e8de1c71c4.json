(G + H is the internal direct product.) Statement 2 | If r divides m and s divides n then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|.\nThis statement is true. The internal direct product of two groups G and H, denoted by G + H, is the direct product of G and H with the additional condition that the elements of G commute with the elements of H. It can be shown that the order (or cardinality) of the internal direct product is equal to the product of the orders of the original groups. Therefore, |G + H| = |G||H|.\n\nStatement 2: If r divides m and s divides n then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.\nThis statement is also true. If r divides m and s divides n, then r and s are divisors of both m and n. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a unique factorization of the sum of m and n in terms of the factorizations of m and n, i.e., m + n = r * m_1 + s * m_2, where r_1 and s_1 are the divisors of r and s, respectively. The subgroup generated by one of these factorizations, which is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s, is a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, and the correct answer is A. True, True.",
