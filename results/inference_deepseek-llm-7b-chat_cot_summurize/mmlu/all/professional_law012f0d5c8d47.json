Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that\n\nA. the leasehold contract was void ab initio.\nB. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.\nC. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.\nD. the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.\n\nassistant:The student's strongest argument to prevent eviction would have been that the widow had not given him requisitenotice for terminating a term of years. This is because, under most state laws, if a tenant has been paying rent for more than three months, the landlord must give the tenant written notice before ending the tenancy. In this case, the student had been paying rent for more than three years, so the widow would need to give him the required notice before evicting him.\n\nSo, the answer is B. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.",
