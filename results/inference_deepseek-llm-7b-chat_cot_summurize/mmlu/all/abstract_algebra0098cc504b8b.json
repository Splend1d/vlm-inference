In the case of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q, we are looking for the smallest field extension that contains Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nSince Q(sqrt(2)) contains all the elements of Q (the rational numbers) and also contains the element sqrt(2), the degree of the extension is at least 3. However, we can show that the degree is actually 1.\n\nLet's consider the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - 2 in Q(sqrt(2)). We can factor this polynomial as follows:\n\nf(x) = (x - sqrt(2))(x + sqrt(2))\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial g(x) = x in Q. We can show that g(x) is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)). To do this, we can use the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number a/b is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, then a is a factor of the constant term of the polynomial and b is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn the case of g(x), the leading coefficient is 1 and the constant term is 1. Therefore, there are no rational roots to g(x), and g(x) is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial h(x) = f(x)g(x). We can compute the result of h(x) as follows:\n\nh(x) = (x - sqrt(2))(x + sqrt(2))(x)\n       = x^3 - 2sqrt(2)x^2 + 2x - 2sqrt(2)\n\nSince g(x) is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)), h(x) must also be irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)). We can show this by again using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nNow, let's consider the polynomial k(x) = x^2 - 2 in Q(sqrt(2)). Since f(x) is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)), k(x) must also be irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)). We can show this by using the Rational Root Theorem again.\n\nWe have now shown that f(x), g(x), and k(x) are all irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)). Therefore, we can say that the extension Q(sqrt(2)) is generated by the polynomial h(x), and the degree of the extension is 1.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1.",
