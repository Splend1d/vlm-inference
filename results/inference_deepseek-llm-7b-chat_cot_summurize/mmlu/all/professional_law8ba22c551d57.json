Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The chemical company may not be entirely exempt from liability just because they took reasonable care and conformed to government regulations. The issue of whether the company's storage tank was state-of-the-art is not relevant to their liability.\n\nB. The state-of-the-art storage tank does not guarantee the safety of the toxic chemicals. The issue of the company's liability is not determined by the type or quality of the storage tank.\n\nC. The concept of strict liability in tort is not applicable in this case, as the question does not mention any specific statute or legal precedent. The company's liability would be determined based on the facts of the situation, not a legal doctrine.",
