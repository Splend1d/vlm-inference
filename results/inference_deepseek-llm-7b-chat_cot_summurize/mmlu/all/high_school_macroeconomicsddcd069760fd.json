How much does the bank have in excess reserves?\n\nA. 10 percent $450 in excess reserves\nB. 90 percent $50 in excess reserves\nC. 90 percent $450 in excess reserves\nD. 10 percent $50 in excess reserves\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we first need to calculate the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is the percentage of total deposits that the bank is required to hold as reserves.\n\nFirst, we calculate the reserve amount:\nReserve amount = Total deposits * Reserve ratio\nReserve amount = $500 * (Required reserve / Total deposits)\nReserve amount = $500 * ($50 / $500)\nReserve amount = $50\n\nNext, we calculate the excess reserves as follows:\nExcess reserves = Total deposits - Reserve amount\nExcess reserves = $500 - $50\nExcess reserves = $450\n\nNow, we can see that the bank has $450 in excess reserves, which is not the same as any of the given options. It seems there might be a mistake in the options provided.",
