Supply-side economists believe that lower taxes on corporate profits encourage investment and economic growth by allowing businesses to keep more of their earnings. This, in turn, leads to increased productivity and job creation. Additionally, lower taxes on interest earned from savings would be supported by supply-side economists as well, as this would incentivize individuals to save and invest more, leading to further economic growth. However, removal of investment tax credits and longer duration of unemployment benefits are not policies that supply-side economists typically advocate for.",
