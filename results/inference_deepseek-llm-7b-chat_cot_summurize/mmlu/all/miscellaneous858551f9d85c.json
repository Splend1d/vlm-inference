Appropriating funds\n\nCongress has several ways to influence the federal bureaucracy, but the most direct method is by appropriating funds. They can allocate more or fewer funds to specific agencies, which can influence their operations and priorities. Other options like increasing or decreasing departmental salaries, appointing agency heads, or dismissing cabinet secretaries may also have an impact, but they are not as direct or impactful as appropriating funds.",
