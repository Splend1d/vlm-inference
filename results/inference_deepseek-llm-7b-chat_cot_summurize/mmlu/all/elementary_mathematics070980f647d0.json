What is the mode?\n\nA. 23\nB. 24\nC. 35\nD. No mode\n\nassistant:To find the mode, we need to determine the number that appears most frequently in the list of numbers provided. The list of numbers is: 22, 25, 14, 11, 23, 27, 46.\n\nFirst, let's count the occurrence of each number in the list:\n\n22: 1 occurrence\n25: 1 occurrence\n14: 1 occurrence\n11: 1 occurrence\n23: 2 occurrences\n27: 1 occurrence\n46: 1 occurrence\n\nNow, let's find the number(s) that appear most frequently:\n\n23 appears twice in the list.\n\nSince there is only one number that appears more than once, the mode is 23.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 23.",
