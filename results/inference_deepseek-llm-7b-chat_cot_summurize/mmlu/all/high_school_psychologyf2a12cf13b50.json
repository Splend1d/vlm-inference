According to the Cannon-Bard theory, the thalamus acts as a relay center for sensory information, sending it to the brain for further processing. The hippocampus, medulla, and association areas are all involved in other aspects of emotional processing, but the thalamus is the key component in the Cannon-Bard theory.",
