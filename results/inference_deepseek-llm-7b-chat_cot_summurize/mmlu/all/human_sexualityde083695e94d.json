Sterilization\nB. The IUD\nC. The diaphragm\nD. The rhythm method\n\nassistant:The most common method of birth control for married couples in the U.S. is the IUD. The IUD, or intrauterine device, is a T-shaped object that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It is a highly effective method of birth control that can provide protection for up to 10 years. The IUD is a long-lasting and reversible method of birth control, and it is a popular choice among many couples. The rhythm method is also a method of birth control, but it is not as effective as the IUD and is not considered a reliable method of birth control.",
