This means that if a formula is unsatisfiable, then it will not be able to provide a proof of its unsatisfiability (I), and it will be able to prove the unsatisfiability of every satisfiable formula of propositional logic (II). Additionally, it is not a succinct proof system, as the length of the proof may not be polynomial in the length of the formula (III). Therefore, the answer is D, I and III only.",
