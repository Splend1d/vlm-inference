DNA provides the macromolecular basis of heredity.\nB. Mendelian principles explain why some traits are dominant and others are recessive.\nC. Prokaryotes include two major domains, the Bacteria and the Archaea.\nD. There exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. There exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct.\n\nThis fact was established prior to 1859. In the 18th and 19th centuries, numerous fossils were discovered, and scientists began to recognize that these fossils represented extinct species. The work of Georges Cuvier and others laid the foundation for the field of paleontology, which studies the history of life on Earth through the examination of fossils.\n\nA. DNA provides the macromolecular basis of heredity: This fact was discovered by Fred Sanger in 1953, when he determined the sequence of DNA.\n\nB. Mendelian principles explain why some traits are dominant and others are recessive: These principles were established by Gregor Mendel in 1866, when he conducted his famous pea plant experiments.\n\nC. Prokaryotes include two major domains, the Bacteria and the Archaea: This classification was proposed by Carl Woese and others in the 1970s and 1980s, based on molecular evidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. There exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct.",
