Running a business to create social benefits\n\nassistant:A social enterprise is a type of business that aims to achieve both financial and social goals. While they may still make a profit, the primary focus of a social enterprise is to provide public service and run a business to create social benefits. This means that they often prioritize the well-being of their community and the environment, as well as the well-being of their employees, over maximizing profits. In this way, social enterprises differ from traditional businesses, which are primarily focused on maximizing profit and market share.",
