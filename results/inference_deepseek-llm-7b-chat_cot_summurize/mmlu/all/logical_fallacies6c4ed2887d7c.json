A straw man argument occurs when someone misrepresents or oversimplifies the views of another person in order to make it easier to criticize or discredit them. In this case, the user describes a situation where someone claims to have defeated an opposing arguer's position, when in fact, the opposing arguer had not taken that position in the first place. This is a straw man because the user is misrepresenting the opposing arguer's position and then defeating it, giving the appearance of defeating an argument that never existed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. straw person.",
