False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3.\n\nThe symmetric group S_n is the group of all permutations of n elements. The group S_n is Abelian if it is commutative, meaning that the group operation is commutative, i.e., for any two elements a and b in the group, the equation a * b = b * a holds. In general, it is not true that S_n is Abelian for all n, but it is true that S_n is Abelian if n is odd.\n\nStatement 2: If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n).\n\nHere, |ab| denotes the order of the product ab, which is the number of elements in the set obtained by applying the product to the set. The lcm (least common multiple) of two numbers m and n is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both m and n.\n\nThis statement is true. If a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then the order of the product ab is the least common multiple of m and n. This is because the product ab consists of m + n - 1 distinct elements, and the least common multiple of m and n is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both m and n.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
