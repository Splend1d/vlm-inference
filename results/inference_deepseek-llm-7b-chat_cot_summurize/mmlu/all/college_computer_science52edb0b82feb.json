One's complement\nII. Two's complement\nIII. Sign and magnitude\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. I and II only\nD. I, II, and III\n\nassistant:To find the answer, we need to determine which of the three representations of numbers by 8-bit words has a range that includes the sum of 109 and -42.\n\nI. One's complement:\nIn the one's complement representation, the most significant bit of each 8-bit word is used as a sign bit. The remaining 7 bits are used to represent the magnitude. The range of this representation is -128 to 127.\n\nII. Two's complement:\nIn the two's complement representation, the most significant bit of each 8-bit word is used as a sign bit. The remaining 7 bits are used to represent the magnitude. The range of this representation is -128 to 127.\n\nIII. Sign and magnitude:\nIn the sign and magnitude representation, the most significant bit of each 8-bit word is used as a sign bit. The remaining 7 bits are used to represent the magnitude. The range of this representation is -128 to 127.\n\nSince the range of the one's complement representation is -128 to 127, and the sum of 109 and -42 is within this range (-127), the one's complement representation has the required range.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.
