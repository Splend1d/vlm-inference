Under those conditions, which of the following acids will have the highest percentage ionization?\n\nA. HNO2\nB. HClO4\nC. H2S\nD. H3PO4\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given options and their ionization behavior in water.\n\nA. HNO2: The ionization of HNO2 would result in H+ and NO2^- ions. The ionization of HNO2 is not very high, and it's not a strong acid.\n\nB. HClO4: The ionization of HClO4 would result in H+ and Cl^- ions. HClO4 is a strong acid, and its ionization behavior is very high, making it the strongest among the given options.\n\nC. H2S: The ionization of H2S would result in H+ and S^2^- ions. H2S is a weak acid, and its ionization behavior is not very high.\n\nD. H3PO4: The ionization of H3PO4 would result in H+ and PO4^3^- ions. H3PO4 is a weak acid, and its ionization behavior is not very high.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. HClO4 will have the highest percentage ionization among the given options.",
