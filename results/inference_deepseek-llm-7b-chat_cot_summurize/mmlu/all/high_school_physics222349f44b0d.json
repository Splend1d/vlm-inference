The electric field increases closer to the rod and then decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the rod.\n\nIn contrast, the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire depends on the current (I) and distance (r) from the wire. The magnetic field increases as the distance from the wire decreases, and then decreases as the inverse square of the distance.\n\nTherefore, the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the rod for distances far from the object producing the field, while the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire also decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the wire for distances far from the object producing the field.",
