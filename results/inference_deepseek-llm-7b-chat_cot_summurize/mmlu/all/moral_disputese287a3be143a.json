Immanuel Kant\nB. Aristotle\nC. Jeremy Bentham\nD. John Stuart Mill\n\nassistant:Singer, the animal rights philosopher, has identified a few historical defenders of the principle of equal consideration of interests who recognized that it applies to members of other species as well as our own. Among these defenders are Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.\n\nImmanuel Kant (option A) was one of the few philosophers who recognized that animals have rights and should be treated with respect and dignity. In his book, \"Critique of Practical Reason,\" Kant argued that all living beings, including animals, have inherent value and should be treated with the same respect and consideration as humans.\n\nJeremy Bentham (option C) was another philosopher who recognized that the principle of equal consideration of interests applies to animals as well as humans. Bentham believed that animals have the same right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as humans. He proposed a utilitarian approach to animal welfare, which emphasized the importance of considering the well-being of animals and their ability to experience pain, suffering, and pleasure.\n\nAristotle (option B), on the other hand, did not recognize that the principle of equal consideration of interests applies to animals. Aristotle believed that animals were simply living beings that lacked reason and consciousness, and as such, were not capable of experiencing emotions or engaging in moral behavior.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (option D) was a defender of the principle of equal consideration of interests, but he did not recognize that it applies to animals. Mill believed that all beings, including humans and animals, have inherent value and should be treated with respect and dignity. However, he did not extend this principle to animals, arguing that their lack of reason and consciousness meant that they were incapable of experiencing emotions or engaging in moral behavior.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham were the historical defenders of the principle of equal consideration of interests who recognized that the principle applies to members of other species as well as to our own.",
