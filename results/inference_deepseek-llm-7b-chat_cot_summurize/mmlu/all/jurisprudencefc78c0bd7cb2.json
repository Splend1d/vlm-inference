Its principal concern is with moral or political values.\nB. It is represented by the positivist view of law as developed by HLA Hart.\nC. It expresses the idea that law consists only of norms.\nD. It is preoccupied with the analysis of the application of legislation to moral issues.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Normative legal theory is represented by the positivist view of law as developed by HLA Hart. This view focuses on the concept of law as a system of rules created by a sovereign authority to regulate social behavior. Normative legal theory, on the other hand, is concerned with the evaluation of these rules and their relationship to moral or political values.\n\nOption A is incorrect because normative legal theory is not primarily concerned with moral or political values, but rather with the evaluation of legal rules and their relationship to these values.\n\nOption C is incorrect because normative legal theory does not express the idea that law consists only of norms. Law consists of rules, principles, and doctrines, not just norms.\n\nOption D is incorrect because normative legal theory is not preoccupied with the analysis of the application of legislation to moral issues. Its primary concern is with the evaluation and critique of legal rules and principles.",
