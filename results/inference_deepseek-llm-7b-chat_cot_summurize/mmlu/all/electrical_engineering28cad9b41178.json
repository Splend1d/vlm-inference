With normal frequeny supply the electromagnetic forces causes severe stirring action in the molten metal.\n\nLow frequency supply is necessary for direct core type induction furnaces because the electromagnetic forces generated by normal frequency supply can cause severe stirring action in the molten metal, which is not desirable in this type of furnace. In direct core type induction furnaces, the electromagnetic forces are used to heat the metal by inducing eddy currents in the metal, rather than using magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuits. This means that the stirring action caused by normal frequency supply can actually reduce the efficiency of the heating process. Therefore, low frequency supply is necessary to avoid this issue and ensure optimal performance of the furnace.",
