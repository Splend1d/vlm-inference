I only.\n\nSteroids are a type of molecule that are derived from cholesterol and are known as steroid-based molecules. Steroids are important for various biological processes in the body, such as regulating inflammation, hormone production, and immune system responses.\n\nAmong the molecules listed, only testosterone and progesterone are steroid-based molecules. Testosterone is a male sex hormone that is produced in the testes and is responsible for the development of male characteristics. Progesterone is a female sex hormone that is produced in the ovaries and is responsible for maintaining the uterine lining and regulating the menstrual cycle.\n\nTriglycerides and DNA are not steroid-based molecules. Triglycerides are a type of fat that is stored in the body and is used for energy. DNA, on the other hand, is a genetic molecule that contains the genetic information needed to make proteins in the body.",
