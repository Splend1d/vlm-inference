He avoids eye contact with people and resists alterations to routine. Daniel is most likely to be diagnosed with\n\nA. Down syndrome.\nB. fetal alcohol syndrome.\nC. mental retardation.\nD. autism.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze the information given about Daniel and look for any indications that might suggest a specific diagnosis.\n\n1. Daniel is a toddler who lags behind his peers in terms of speech development. This information is relevant as it indicates a potential delay in cognitive or neurological development.\n\n2. Daniel avoids eye contact with people. This is a common symptom of autism, as individuals with autism often struggle with social interactions and may avoid making eye contact.\n\n3. Daniel resists alterations to routine. This is a common symptom of autism as well, as individuals with autism tend to have a hard time with changes to their daily routine or environment.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is most likely that Daniel is diagnosed with autism (option D). While Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome could also be potential diagnoses, the information given does not specifically mention any symptoms that would suggest these conditions. Mental retardation is not mentioned at all, so it is not a likely diagnosis based on the information provided.",
