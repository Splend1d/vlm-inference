All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane.\nB. All cells have at least one nucleus.\nC. All cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria.\nD. The surface-to-volume ratio of all cells is the same.\n\nassistant:All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane.\n\nThe plasma membrane is a selectively permeable membrane that surrounds the cell and separates the cell from its external environment. This membrane is made up of lipids and proteins and allows specific molecules to pass through while blocking others. The plasma membrane plays a crucial role in the cell's homeostasis, allowing for the movement of molecules in and out of the cell, and regulating the cell's interactions with its environment.\n\nWhile the other options listed may be true for certain types of cells, they do not provide a comprehensive picture of the unity of all life. The presence of a nucleus is not exclusive to all cells, as some cells, such as red blood cells, do not have a nucleus. Cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria, which are present in all cells, but not all cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria. The surface-to-volume ratio of cells is not a universally applicable aspect of cell structure.\n\nTherefore, the plasma membrane is the aspect of cell structure that best reveals the unity of all life.",
