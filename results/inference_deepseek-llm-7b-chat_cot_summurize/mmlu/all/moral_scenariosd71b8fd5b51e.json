Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character throws a frisbee to their daughter. While this action may be considered reckless or dangerous, it does not necessarily involve a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character guides a plane over the tallest mountain that they can see. This action could potentially be dangerous or irresponsible, and it might be seen as a violation of aviation safety regulations. However, it is more likely to be considered morally wrong than the first scenario.",
