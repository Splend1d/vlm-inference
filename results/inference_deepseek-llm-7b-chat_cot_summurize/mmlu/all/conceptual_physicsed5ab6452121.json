A common nuclear fission reactor heats water, which is then used to generate steam and power a turbine. The turbine spins a generator, which produces electricity. Nuclear fission is the process of splitting atomic nuclei into smaller parts, releasing energy in the process. This energy can be used to generate electricity, but it is not obtained from nothing, as some people might think. The process of fission requires a certain amount of energy to initiate, and the waste products of fission are radioactive and can be harmful to the environment if not properly handled. Therefore, option D is also true, but the primary function of a nuclear fission reactor is to generate electricity through the process of fission.",
