False, False\n\nassistant:Statement 1 is a statement about the topology of a set, and Statement 2 is a statement about a specific type of function. We can address each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1: If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected.\nThis statement is true. In general, the closure of a connected set is connected. This is because the closure of a set is the union of the set and its closure, which is the smallest closed set containing the set. Since the set is connected, its closure is also connected.\n\nStatement 2: Every continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) has a fixed point.\nThis statement is also true. A fixed point of a function is a value that the function maps back to itself. For a continuous function on the interval (0, 1), it is possible for the function to have multiple fixed points, or no fixed points at all. However, if the function is continuous and maps the interval (0, 1) to itself, it must have at least one fixed point. This is because the function can approach its own fixed points, and if it does not have any fixed points, it would have to approach the endpoints of the interval, which would create a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A.
