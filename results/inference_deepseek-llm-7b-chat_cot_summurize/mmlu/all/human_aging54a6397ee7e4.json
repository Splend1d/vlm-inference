Unhappy people\nB. Older adults\nC. People with very low SES\nD. Terminally ill people\n\nassistant:The Paradox of Well-Being refers to the finding of high levels of happiness among people with very low SES. This paradox suggests that people with lower socioeconomic status may experience higher levels of happiness than those with higher socioeconomic status. One possible explanation for this paradox is that people with lower socioeconomic status have fewer material possessions and are less focused on accumulating material wealth, which can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and happiness.\n\nAdditionally, people with lower socioeconomic status may be more likely to have strong social connections and a sense of community, which can also contribute to greater happiness. Furthermore, research has shown that people with lower socioeconomic status may have a greater sense of control over their lives and a more positive outlook on the world, which can also lead to higher levels of happiness.\n\nOn the other hand, people with very high socioeconomic status may be more focused on material wealth and status, which can lead to a greater sense of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. Additionally, people with very high socioeconomic status may have fewer social connections and a greater sense of isolation, which can also contribute to lower levels of happiness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. People with very low SES.",
