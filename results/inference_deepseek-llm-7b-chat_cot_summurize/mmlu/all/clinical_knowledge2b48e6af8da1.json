One gram of glucose\nB. One gram of palmitic acid\nC. One gram of leucine\nD. One gram of alcohol\n\nassistant:When completely oxidised in the body, the release of energy is highest for a substance with the highest amount of calories per gram. Let's compare the calories per gram of each of the options you provided:\n\nA. One gram of glucose: 4 calories\nB. One gram of palmitic acid: 9 calories\nC. One gram of leucine: 4 calories\nD. One gram of alcohol: 7 calories\n\nAs you can see, the highest amount of calories per gram is in option B, one gram of palmitic acid. Therefore, when completely oxidised in the body, palmitic acid releases the most energy.",
