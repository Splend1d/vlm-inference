This term refers to the large mammals that lived during this period, including species like mammoths, mammoth-like animals, and giant sloths. These creatures thrived in the colder climates of the Ice Age and played a significant role in shaping the ecosystems of their time.\n\nMegafauna is derived from the Greek words \"mega,\" which means \"large,\" and \"fauna,\" which refers to the animal life of a region. The term was first coined in the late 19th century by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who used it to describe the large fossilized bones he discovered in the American Southwest.\n\nMegafauna became a popular concept in the field of paleontology and was widely accepted as the term to describe the large, extinct herbivores of the Pleistocene era. These animals left behind evidence of their existence in the form of fossils, which have been instrumental in reconstructing the history of life on Earth and understanding the various ecosystems that existed during the Ice Age.\n\nThe extinction of megafauna has been attributed to a combination of factors, including climate change, competition with smaller species, and human impact on their habitats. The extinction of these large herbivores had a significant impact on the ecosystems they inhabited, as they played a critical role in shaping the composition and structure of their environments.\n\nIn conclusion, the large, extinct herbivores of the Pleistocene era are referred to as megafauna. This term captures the significance of these creatures in the history of life on Earth and the role they played in shaping the ecosystems of their time.",
