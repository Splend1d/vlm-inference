The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas. After one week, how many amoebas are in the puddle? (Assume the puddle has no amoebas before the first one is placed in the puddle.)\n\nA. 256\nB. 1024\nC. 64\nD. 128\n\nassistant:To calculate the total number of amoebas after one week, we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\nNumber of amoebas = Initial number of amoebas * (2^(number of days))\n\nIn this case, the initial number of amoebas is 1 (the first amoeba), and the number of days is 7 (one week).\n\nNumber of amoebas = 1 * (2^7)\nNumber of amoebas = 1 * 128\nNumber of amoebas = 128\n\nSo, there are 128 amoebas in the puddle after one week.
