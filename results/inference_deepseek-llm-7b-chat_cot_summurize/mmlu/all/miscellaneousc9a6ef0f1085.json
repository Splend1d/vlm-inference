Creating a chart with the class that shows the many ways students in the class are similar.\n\nJustifying my answer, the best way to help the class become aware of the common interests they share with the new student is by creating a chart that highlights the similarities between them. This will help to reduce the feeling of difference and increase understanding and acceptance. Option A is not the best choice as it may not directly address the issue of exclusion. Option C is too focused on the new student's background and not on the similarities. Option D is more focused on the new student's learning needs, rather than bringing the class together.",
