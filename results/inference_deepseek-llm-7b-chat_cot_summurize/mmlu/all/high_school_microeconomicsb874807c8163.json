This is because as the number of workers or the amount of capital increases, the marginal product of labor or capital will decrease.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the average product of labor is not the same as the marginal product of labor. The average product of labor is the total output divided by the total input, while the marginal product of labor is the change in output divided by the change in input.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the total product of labor is the sum of the marginal products of all the workers, not just one worker.\n\nOption C is not relevant to the diminishing marginal returns concept. It is related to the concept of negative marginal product of labor, which occurs when the additional unit of labor input does not increase output.",
