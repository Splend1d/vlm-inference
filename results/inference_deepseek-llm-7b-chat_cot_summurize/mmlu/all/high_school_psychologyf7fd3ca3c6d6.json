Collective unconscious. Carl Jung's concept of a repository of ideas, feelings, and symbols shared by all humans and passed genetically from one generation to another is known as Jung's theory of the collective unconscious. This theory suggests that the collective unconscious contains universal archetypes and inherited images that are present in the shared human psyche, transcending individual differences and cultural backgrounds.\n\nOption A, cultural subconscious, refers to the collective unconscious's influence on cultural expressions and behaviors. Option B, general awareness, refers to the awareness of one's surroundings and general knowledge. Option C, heritability coefficients, refer to the proportion of an individual's trait variance that is attributed to genetic factors. None of these options accurately represents Jung's theory of the collective unconscious.",
