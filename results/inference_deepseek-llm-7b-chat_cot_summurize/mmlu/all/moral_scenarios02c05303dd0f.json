Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character changed their small son's diaper whenever they felt like it, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, the main character sticks out their cane to trip the thief who is running from the police. This action can be considered morally wrong as it may cause harm to the thief, and interfering with the police could be illegal.",
