These physical reactions were most directly regulated by his\n\nA. sensorimotor system\nB. somatic nervous system\nC. sympathetic nervous system\nD. pineal gland\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. sympathetic nervous system.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response, which is the body's natural reaction to stress or perceived danger. In this case, Jared's physical reactions (increased blood pressure, faster breathing rate) were most directly regulated by his sympathetic nervous system.\n\nThe other options are not the most accurate answer:\n\nA. sensorimotor system - This system is responsible for the body's sensory and motor functions, but it does not directly regulate physical reactions to stress.\n\nB. somatic nervous system - This system is responsible for controlling the body's voluntary muscles, but it does not directly regulate the body's stress response.\n\nD. pineal gland - This gland produces the hormone melatonin, which regulates sleep and wake cycles, but it does not directly regulate the body's stress response.",
