False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1 is true. If R is a commutative ring with unity (an integral domain) and a is in R, then a[x] is in R[x], and since R is an integral domain, a[x] is also in R[x]. Therefore, R[x] is an integral domain.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. If f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then the polynomial fg(x) is in R[x]. The degree of fg(x) is the sum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x), which is the same as the degree of f(x) plus the degree of g(x).",
