All of these\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. circular.\n\nExplanation: The magnitude of the gravitational force on a satellite is constant if the orbit is circular. This is because in a circular orbit, the satellite moves in a perfect circle around the Earth or another celestial body, and the gravitational force acting on it remains constant.\n\nParabolic and elliptical orbits do not maintain a constant gravitational force, as the satellite's path in these orbits is not a perfect circle. In a parabolic orbit, the gravitational force is constant along the path, but the force is not constant over time. In an elliptical orbit, the gravitational force is not constant along the path, and it is not constant over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. circular.",
