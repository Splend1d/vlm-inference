I and II only\n\nassistant:Let's substitute the given determinant expression into the equation for the determinant of A - \u03bbI and solve for \u03bb.\n\ndet(A - \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3\n\nRearrange the equation to obtain the characteristic equation:\n\n(\u03bb^3 - 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3) = 0\n\nFactor the equation:\n\n\u03bb(\u03bb^2 - 3\u03bb + 1) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n\u03bb^2 - 3\u03bb + 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\u03bb = (3 \u00b1 \u221a(3^2 - 4(1)))/2 = (3 \u00b1 \u221a(0))/2 = 1/2 or 3/2\n\nWe have two eigenvalues: \u03bb1 = 1/2 and \u03bb2 = 3/2.\n\nNow, let's compute the trace and determinant of A:\n\nTr(A) = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2\n\ndet(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 = (1/2) * (3/2) = 3/4\n\nSince the determinant of A is not equal to -3, neither I nor II are true.\n\nThe matrix A has eigenvalues 1/2 and 3/2. Therefore, the correct answer is C. III only.",
