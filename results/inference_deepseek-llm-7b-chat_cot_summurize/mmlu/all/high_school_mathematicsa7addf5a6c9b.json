[-\\frac{1}{2}, 0] - This interval contains all values between -1/2 and 0, which are all numbers that are not less than -1 or greater than -1/2. However, if we apply the condition \"neither 2u nor -20u is in the interval (-infty, -1)\", then all values in this interval should be valid, as neither 2u nor -20u will be in the interval (-infty, -1) for any value of u.\n\nB. [-1,1] - This interval contains all values between -1 and 1, which are all numbers that are not less than -1 or greater than 1. However, if we apply the condition \"neither 2u nor -20u is in the interval (-infty, -1)\", then all values in this interval should be valid, as neither 2u nor -20u will be in the interval (-infty, -1) for any value of u.\n\nC. [-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{20}] - This interval contains all values between -1/2 and -1/20, which are all numbers that are not less than -1/2 or greater than -1/20. However, if we apply the condition \"neither 2u nor -20u is in the interval (-infty, -1)\", then all values in this interval should be valid, as neither 2u nor -20u will be in the interval (-infty, -1) for any value of u.\n\nD. [0,2] - This interval contains all values between 0 and 2, which are all numbers that are not less than 0 or greater than 2. However, if we apply the condition \"neither 2u nor -20u is in the interval (-infty, -1)\", then all values in this interval should be invalid, as 2u or -20u would be in the interval (-infty, -1) for some value of u.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
