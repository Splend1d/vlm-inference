An eight month old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglect the child\nD. A thirteen month old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child\n\nassistant:A two-month-old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment is most likely to attach to a male psychologist, previously unknown to the child, in the course of a psychological study. According to attachment theory, a secure attachment is formed when the child experiences a consistent and reliable caregiver who provides emotional support, comfort, and security. A two-month-old female infant who has been raised in a safe, stable environment is more likely to form a secure attachment and be open to forming attachments with others, including a male psychologist.\n\nOn the other hand, a five-month-old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment, an eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child, a thirteen-month-old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child, are less likely to attach to a male psychologist, previously unknown to the child, in the course of a psychological study.",
