Then, using the same number of subdivisions, and with L, R, M, and T denoting, respectively, left, right, midpoint, and trapezoid sums, it follows that\n\nA. R <= T <= M <= L\nB. L <= T <= M <= R\nC. R <= M <= T <= L\nD. L <= M <= T <= R\n\nassistant:We can analyze the given information to determine the correct order of the sums. \n\nSince the graph of f is both increasing and concave up on a <= x <= b, this means that f is a decreasing function on the interval (a, b). Therefore, the left sum (L) will be greater than the right sum (R) for this interval.\n\nNow, let's consider the trapezoid sum (T). The trapezoid sum is equal to the average of the left and right sums over the interval. Since the left sum is greater than the right sum, the average will be greater than both sums. Therefore, the trapezoid sum will be greater than the left sum (M) and the right sum (R).\n\nFinally, let's consider the midpoint sum (M). The midpoint sum is equal to the average of the left and right sums over the interval. Since the left sum is greater than the right sum, the average will be greater than both sums. Therefore, the midpoint sum will be greater than the left sum (L) and the right sum (R).\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that L <= M <= T <= R. Therefore, the answer is D. L <= M <= T <= R.",
