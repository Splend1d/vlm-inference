Analyze the given information to understand the context of the question.\n2. Identify the correct answer based on the context.\n3. Justify the reasoning behind the correct answer.\n\nStep 1: Analyzing the given information\nThe question is about water and minerals reaching the xylem in the center of a plant root.\n\nStep 2: Identifying the correct answer\nThe correct answer is B. \"move through neighboring phloem vessels.\"\n\nStep 3: Justifying the reasoning\nThe xylem transports water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. When water and minerals reach the xylem in the center of a plant root, they must first pass through the root epidermis through stomata. These stomata are tiny openings in the root epidermis that allow gases to pass through. The water and minerals can then move through the neighboring phloem vessels, which are tubes that carry water and sugars between the roots and other parts of the plant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. move through neighboring phloem vessels.",
