The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.\nB. Management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory.\nC. The entity omits the statement of cash flows from its financial statements.\nD. The auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary.\n\nassistant:Option A is the correct answer. According to auditing standards, an auditor of a nonissuer may not issue a qualified opinion when the auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity. This means that the auditor must be able to provide an objective and impartial opinion on the financial statements, and any lack of independence can result in a qualified opinion being issued.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect. While options B and C relate to specific issues that an auditor may encounter when auditing a nonissuer, they do not prevent the auditor from issuing a qualified opinion. Option D is incorrect because the auditor's report referring to the work of an actuary is not relevant to the issue of whether a qualified opinion can be issued by the auditor of a nonissuer.",
