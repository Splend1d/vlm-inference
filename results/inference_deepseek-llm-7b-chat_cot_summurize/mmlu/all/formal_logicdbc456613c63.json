P \u2283 Q: If P is true, Q must be true for the argument to be true. This is not always the case in the truth table.\n2. Q \u00b7 R / ~P \u00b7 R: If Q is true and R is true, the argument is true. If P is false, ~P is true, and the argument is false. This also does not hold for every combination in the truth table.\n3. P \u2283 R: If P is true, R must be true for the argument to be true. This is always true.\n4. P \u2283 (Q \u2227 R): If P is true and Q and R are both true, the argument is true. This is always true.\n5. P \u2283 (~P \u2228 R): If P is false or R is true, the argument is true. This is always true.\n\nThe argument is invalid since it does not hold true for every combination of P, Q, and R. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and Q are true",
