It also mentions that the whites consider the blacks their property by natural right.\n\nNow, I will look for the specific development that contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region. - This option does not seem relevant to the general sentiment expressed in the text.\n\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States. - This option also does not seem relevant to the general sentiment expressed in the text.\n\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England. - This option might be relevant, as it could have contributed to the sentiment of the people towards the rights of the Negroes. The French could have been seen as supporting the rights of the African Americans, which could have exacerbated the sentiment of the whites towards the blacks.\n\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland. - This option does not seem relevant to the general sentiment expressed in the text.\n\nBased on the analysis, the specific development that contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15 was likely option C: French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.",
