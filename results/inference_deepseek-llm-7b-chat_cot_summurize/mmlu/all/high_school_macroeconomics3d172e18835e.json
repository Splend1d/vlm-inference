Higher disposable income lower consumption higher real GDP lower unemployment\nC. Lower disposable income higher consumption higher real GDP lower unemployment\nD. Lower disposable income lower consumption lower real GDP higher unemployment\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Higher disposable income higher consumption higher real GDP lower unemployment.\n\nWhen the government lowers personal income taxes, people have more money left after paying taxes, which is called disposable income.

This is not consistent with the effects of lowering personal income taxes.\n\nC is incorrect because it says lower disposable income higher consumption higher real GDP lower unemployment. This is not consistent with the effects of lowering personal income taxes.\n\nD is incorrect because it says lower disposable income lower consumption lower real GDP higher unemployment. This is not consistent with the effects of lowering personal income taxes.",
