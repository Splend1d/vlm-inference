Providing legal services to the client in a foreign jurisdiction.\n\nassistant:The answer is C. Providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client.\n\nAccording to the rules issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, an accounting firm is permitted to provide nonaudit services to an issuer audit client without impairing its independence, as long as the services are not material or substantial. In this case, providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client is considered a permissible nonaudit service.\n\nThe other options are not allowed because they would impair the accounting firm's independence:\n\nA. Providing an expert opinion in order to advocate the client's interest in litigation - This would involve the accounting firm taking a position on behalf of the client, which could be seen as engaging in lobbying or advocacy, and therefore could impair the firm's independence.\n\nB. Providing an expert opinion in order to advocate the client's position in a regulatory investigation - Similar to option A, this would involve the accounting firm taking a position on behalf of the client, which could be seen as engaging in lobbying or advocacy, and therefore could impair the firm's independence.\n\nD. Providing legal services to the client in a foreign jurisdiction - This would involve the accounting firm providing legal services to the client, which could be seen as engaging in a non-accounting service, and therefore could impair the firm's independence.",
