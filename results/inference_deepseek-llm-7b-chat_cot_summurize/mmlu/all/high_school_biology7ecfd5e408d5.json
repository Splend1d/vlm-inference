Reproductive isolation was not complete.\n\nThe passage mentions that the populations of mosquito fish, Gambusia hubbsi, colonized a series of ponds that are no longer connected. However, it does not mention anything about geographic isolation. Therefore, the passage suggests that reproductive isolation was not complete, as the ponds are still connected and the environments are very similar in most aspects.",
