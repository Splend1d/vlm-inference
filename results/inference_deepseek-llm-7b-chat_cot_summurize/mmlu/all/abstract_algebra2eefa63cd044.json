False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z.\nZ is the set of integers, while 4x - 2 is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, 4x - 2 is always irreducible over Z. This statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.\nQ is the set of rational numbers, while 4x - 2 is a polynomial with integer coefficients. In general, a polynomial with integer coefficients is irreducible over Q if and only if it is irreducible over Z. Therefore, 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q, which is also true.\n\nBoth statements are true, so the correct answer is A. True, True.",
