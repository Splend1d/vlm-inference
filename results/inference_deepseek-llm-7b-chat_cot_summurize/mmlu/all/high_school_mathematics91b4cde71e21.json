The function f (x) is decreasing for x \u2264 \u20133.\n\nassistant:To determine which statement is true, we can analyze the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18.\n\nA. f (x) = 0 has three real solutions.\nWe can find the roots of the function by setting it equal to zero and solving for x:\nx^3 + 2x^2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18 = 0\n\nUsing the Rational Root Theorem, we can test for possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of 18, which are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16, \u00b19, and \u00b118. We can test these values and find that x = -1 is a root:\n\n(1)(-1)^3 + 2(1)^2 \u2013 9(1) \u2013 18 = 1 + 2 \u2013 9 \u2013 18 = 0\n\nSince we found a root, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n(x^3 + 2x^2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18) / (x \u2013 1) = (x^2 + 5x + 18)\n\nNow we can find the remaining roots by factoring the quadratic:\n\nx^2 + 5x + 18 = (x + 6)(x + 3)\n\nSo the roots are x = -6, x = -3, and x = 3.\n\nB. f (x) \u2265 \u201318 for all x \u2265 0.\nWe can analyze the function for x \u2265 0:\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18 \u2265 0\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot find a simple expression for this inequality, so we would need to use numerical methods or graphing to analyze it. However, if we graph the function, we can see that it has a local minimum at x = 3 and then increases for x > 3. Therefore, f(x) \u2265 0 for all x \u2265 0.\n\nC. f (x) \u2264 \u201318 for all x \u2264 0.\nWe can analyze the function for x \u2264 0:\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18 \u2264 0\n\nAgain, we cannot find a simple expression for this inequality, so we would need to use numerical methods or graphing to analyze it. If we graph the function, we can see that it has a local maximum at x = -3 and then decreases for x < -3. Therefore, f(x) \u2264 0 for all x \u2264 0.\n\nD. The function f (x) is decreasing for x \u2264 \u20133.\nWe can analyze the function for x \u2264 \u20133:\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 \u2013 9x \u2013 18 \u2264 0\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot find a simple expression for this inequality, so we would need to use numerical methods or graphing to analyze it. If we graph the function, we can see that it has a local maximum at x = -3 and then decreases for x < -3. Therefore, f(x) is decreasing for x \u2264 -3.\n\nIn summary, none of the options are true for the given function.",
