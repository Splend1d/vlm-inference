Doubling the volume of the buffer solution by adding water has what effect on its pH?\n\nA. It has little effect.\nB. It significantly increases the pH.\nC. It significantly decreases the pH.\nD. It changes the pH asymptotically to the pKa of the acid.\n\nassistant:The effect of doubling the volume of a buffer solution made from equal concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base is to slightly decrease its pH. This is because, when water is added to the buffer, more conjugate base is produced, which increases the concentration of the conjugate base and decreases the concentration of the weak acid. As a result, the acidity of the buffer decreases, causing a slight decrease in pH.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. It significantly decreases the pH.",
