In this case, the identity element is the element (0,0).\n\nThe elements of Z_3 x Z_3 are pairs of integers, and the addition operation is performed component-wise. The identity element (0,0) can be added to any element in the set to get that element, since 0+0=0, and 0+a=a for a in Z_3.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of Z_3 x Z_3 is 0, which corresponds to option A.",
