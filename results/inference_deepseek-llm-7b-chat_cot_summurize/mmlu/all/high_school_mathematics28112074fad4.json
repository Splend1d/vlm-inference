There are 20 computers available, two of which do not work. Mr. Cleary\u2019s class has 14 kids, and Ms. Ntuala\u2019s class has 12 kids. If every student must use a computer and there can only be 2 students on a computer at most, what is the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves?\n\nA. 2\nB. 6\nC. 10\nD. 14\n\nassistant:To find the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves, we need to divide the total number of computers by 2 (since each computer can have at most 2 students).\n\n20 computers - 2 non-working computers = 18 working computers\n18 working computers / 2 students per computer = 9 students per computer\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of computers that are already occupied by both Mr. Cleary's and Ms. Ntuala's classes.\n\n14 students (Mr. Cleary's class) + 12 students (Ms. Ntuala's class) = 26 students total\n18 working computers * 2 students per computer = 36 total student capacity\n\nSince there are already 26 students, we cannot accommodate all the students. Therefore, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is 26 students - 2 non-working computers = 24 students.\n\nThe answer is not listed in the options, but it should be D. 14.",
