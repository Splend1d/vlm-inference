Increasing the discount rate\nB. Increasing the reserve ratio\nC. Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks\nD. Lowering income taxes\n\nassistant:C. Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks\n\nExpansionary monetary policy is implemented by the Federal Reserve to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. One of the ways the Fed implements this policy is by buying Treasury securities from commercial banks. This increases the money supply in the economy, making it easier for people and businesses to borrow money and spend money.\n\nA. Increasing the discount rate is a restrictive monetary policy measure, which is the opposite of expansionary policy. It makes it more expensive for banks to borrow money from the Fed, which can slow down economic growth.\n\nB. Increasing the reserve ratio is also a restrictive monetary policy measure. It requires banks to hold more reserves at the Fed, which can limit the amount of money they can lend out to borrowers.\n\nD. Lowering income taxes is a fiscal policy measure, which is separate from monetary policy. While it can increase economic growth by increasing consumer spending, it is not a direct action of the Federal Reserve.",
