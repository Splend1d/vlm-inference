With the string taut one book is pushed off the edge of the table. As it falls the other book is dragged horizontally across the table surface. With no friction acceleration of the books is\n\nA. zero\nB. g/2\nC. g\nD. a value between zero and g\n\nassistant:To determine the acceleration of the books, we need to consider the forces acting on them. The force of gravity is acting on both books, pulling them towards the center of the Earth. The string is also acting as a force, trying to keep the books together and in a straight line.\n\nSince the string is taut, it is in tension. The tension force is equal and opposite to the gravitational force on each book. The tension force is pulling the books towards each other, while the gravitational force is pushing them apart.\n\nThe net force acting on each book is the difference between the tension force and the gravitational force:\n\nNet force = Tension force - Gravitational force\n\nSince the books are tied together, the net force on each book is the same. We can find the tension force by using the formula:\n\nTension force = mg + m(g - v^2/r^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of each book, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), v is the velocity of the books, and r is the distance between the centers of the books.\n\nSince the books are tied together, they are in contact and their centers of mass are the same distance apart. Therefore, r = 0, and the formula simplifies to:\n\nTension force = mg + m(g - v^2)\n\nSince the string is taut, the tension force is equal to the weight of one book:\n\nmg = Tension force\n\nNow we can find the acceleration of each book:\n\na = (Tension force - Gravitational force) / m\na = (mg - m(g - v^2)) / m\na = (mg - mg + m(g - v^2)) / m\na = (g - g + g - v^2) / m\na = (4g - v^2) / m\n\nSince the net force on each book is the same, we can set the acceleration of each book equal to each other:\n\n(4g - v^2) / m = (4g - v^2) / m\n\nThis equation holds true for any value of v, so the acceleration of the books is:\n\na = g\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
