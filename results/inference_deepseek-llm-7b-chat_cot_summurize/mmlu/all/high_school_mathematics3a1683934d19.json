If the ratio of the length to the height of the television screen is 5 to 3, how much shorter, to the nearest inch, will the horizontal length of the television screen be if the measure is made along the diagonal of the television screen rather than along the horizontal length?\n\nA. 3\nB. 7\nC. 8\nD. 9\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to determine the diagonal length of the television screen.\n\nLet's denote the length of the screen as L, the width of the screen as W, and the height of the screen as H. We are given that the ratio of the length to the height is 5 to 3, which can be represented as L/H = 5/3.\n\nWe can also use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal length of the television screen. The diagonal length (D) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the screen's width and height.\n\nD^2 = L^2 + W^2\nD^2 = (5/3) * H^2 + W^2\n\nWe are given that the width of the television screen is 48 inches, so W = 48 inches.\n\nNow we need to find the value of H. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again:\n\nH^2 = (5/3) * H^2 + W^2\n2 * H^2 = (5/3) * H^2 + 48^2\nH^2 = (3/5) * 48^2\nH = 48 * sqrt(3/5)\n\nNow we can find the diagonal length (D) using the equation:\n\nD^2 = (5/3) * H^2 + W^2\nD^2 = (5/3) * (48 * sqrt(3/5))^2 + 48^2\nD^2 = (5/3) * (48 * sqrt(3*5/5)) + 48^2\nD^2 = (5/3) * 48 * 6 + 48^2\nD^2 = 1440 + 2304\nD^2 = 3744\n\nNow we can find the diagonal length (D):\n\nD = sqrt(3744)\nD \u2248 66.7 inches\n\nNow we can find the difference in length between the diagonal measurement and the horizontal measurement:\n\nDifference = 66.7 inches - 48 inches\nDifference \u2248 18.7 inches\n\nThe customer is unsure of whether the advertised width of the television is along the horizontal length or the diagonal length. If the width is measured along the diagonal length, the horizontal length of the television screen will be about 18.7 inches shorter than the advertised width.\n\nTo the nearest inch, the answer is:\n\nB. 7",
