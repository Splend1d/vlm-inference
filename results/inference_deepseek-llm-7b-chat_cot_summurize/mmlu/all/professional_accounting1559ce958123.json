What amount should the production budget show for units to be produced during the first quarter?\n\nA. 36000\nB. 33000\nC. 24000\nD. 12000\n\nassistant:To find the production budget for units to be produced during the first quarter, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total projected sales for the year.\n2. Calculate the total inventory at the end of the year.\n3. Calculate the quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of each quarter.\n4. Find the difference between the total inventory at the end of the year and the beginning inventory.\n5. Divide the difference by the number of quarters to find the average inventory per quarter.\n6. Calculate the quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of the first quarter.\n7. Subtract the quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of the first quarter from the total projected sales for the first quarter to find the quantity of units to be produced.\n\nNow let's perform the calculations:\n\n1. Total projected sales for the year = 120,000 units\n2. Total inventory at the end of the year = 9,000 units + 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales = 9,000 + 0.3 \\* (40,000 + 30% of 40,000) = 9,000 + 0.3 \\* (40,000 + 0.3 \\* 40,000) = 9,000 + 0.3 \\* 80,000 = 9,000 + 24,000 = 33,000 units\n3. Quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of each quarter = 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales = 0.3 \\* (40,000 + 30% of 40,000) = 0.3 \\* (40,000 + 0.3 \\* 40,000) = 0.3 \\* 80,000 = 24,000 units\n4. Difference between the total inventory at the end of the year and the beginning inventory = 33,000 - 9,000 = 24,000 units\n5. Average inventory per quarter = 24,000 units / 4 = 6,000 units\n6. Quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of the first quarter = 24,000 units - 6,000 units = 18,000 units\n7. Quantity of units to be produced = Total projected sales for the first quarter - Quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of the first quarter = 40,000 - 18,000 = 22,000 units\n\nThe production budget should show 22,000 units to be produced during the first quarter. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 12,000.",
