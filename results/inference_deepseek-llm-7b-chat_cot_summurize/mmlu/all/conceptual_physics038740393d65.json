When did the number of neutrons reach half a billion?\n\nA. 1 minute.\nB. 2 minutes.\nC. 5 minutes.\nD. 9 minutes.\n\nassistant:To find the answer, we can use a simple math equation:\n\nInitial_number * (2^(time_passed/60)) = Final_number\n\nInitial_number = 0 (since the number of neutrons starts at 0)\nFinal_number = 1,000,000,000 (since the number of neutrons reaches one billion in 10 minutes)\ntime_passed = 10 minutes\n\nInitial_number = 0\nFinal_number = 1,000,000,000\ntime_passed = 10 minutes\n\n0 * (2^(10/60)) = 0\n\nNow, let's plug the values into the equation:\n\nInitial_number * (2^(time_passed/60)) = Final_number\n\n0 * (2^(10/60)) = 1,000,000,000\n\nTo find the time it takes for the number of neutrons to reach half a billion, we need to find the value of (10/60) and use the equation:\n\n(10/60) = 1/6\n\n(2^(1/6)) = (2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6))\n\n(2^(1/6))^9 = (2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6) * 2^(1/6))\n\n(2^(1/6))^9 = 1024\n\nNow, we'll find the time it takes for the number of neutrons to reach half a billion:\n\nTime_to_half_billion = 9 minutes\n\nThe number of neutrons reached half a billion in 9 minutes. Therefore, the answer is D. 9 minutes.",
