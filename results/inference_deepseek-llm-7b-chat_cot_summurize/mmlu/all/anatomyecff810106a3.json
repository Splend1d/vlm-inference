Inferior vena cava.\n\nThe blood that flows from the right ventricle of the heart enters the inferior vena cava, which is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood back to the heart. From there, the blood is pumped back into the lungs to receive oxygen. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. Left ventricle: The left ventricle of the heart pumps oxygenated blood to the body, not receiving deoxygenated blood from the lungs.\nC. Pulmonary arteries: These arteries carry oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the lungs, not receiving deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle.\nD. Pulmonary veins: These veins carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs to receive oxygen, not receiving deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle.",
