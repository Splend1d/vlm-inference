Scenario 1 | The surgeon general says smoking causes cancer, so I hide my husband's cigarettes. Scenario 2 | The antiques dealer gave me too much money for the trade so i took it back.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is hiding their husband's cigarettes because they believe that the surgeon general's statement about smoking causing cancer is true. While this may be seen as morally questionable, it is not clear that the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character takes back the extra money they received from the antiques dealer. This action is not morally wrong, as it is not considered dishonest or theft. The dealer gave the main character too much money, so taking it back is not considered stealing. Therefore, this scenario does not involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.",
