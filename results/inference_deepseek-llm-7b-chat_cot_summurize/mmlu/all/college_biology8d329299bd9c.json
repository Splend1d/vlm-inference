Absence of a group of contiguous segments\nB. Transformation of one segment into another\nC. Polarity defects in every segment along the anterior-posterior axis\nD. Tumor formation in imaginal discs\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Polarity defects in every segment along the anterior-posterior axis.\n\nMutation of homeotic cluster genes often results in developmental defects in Drosophila, including polarity defects in every segment along the anterior-posterior axis. Homeotic genes encode transcription factors that play a critical role in determining the identity and patterning of body segments in animals. When these genes are mutated, it can lead to a variety of developmental defects, including abnormalities in the patterning of body segments, segmentation, and organogenesis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a mutation of homeotic cluster genes does not typically result in the absence of a group of contiguous segments. Instead, it can lead to segmentation abnormalities, which may include the appearance of additional or missing segments.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while a mutation of homeotic cluster genes can result in the transformation of one segment into another, this is not a common or specific consequence of these mutations.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a mutation of homeotic cluster genes does not typically result in tumor formation in imaginal discs. Instead, it can lead to a variety of developmental defects, including abnormalities in the patterning of body segments and organogenesis.",
