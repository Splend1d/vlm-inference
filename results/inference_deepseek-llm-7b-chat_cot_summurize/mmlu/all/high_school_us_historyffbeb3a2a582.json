This was different from previous policies, which primarily focused on regulating trade between Britain and the colonies. The Sugar Act imposed new duties on certain colonial imports, including sugar, molasses, and other goods, in an attempt to raise revenue for the British government. This marked a significant departure from the earlier policy of relying on the colonies to pay for their own defense and protection, and was a key factor in the growing tensions between the colonies and the British government in the years leading up to the American Revolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. levied taxes aimed at raising revenue rather than regulating trade.",
