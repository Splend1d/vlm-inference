Nitric acid has one oxygen atom more than nitrous acid, which increases its acidic strength. The increased number of oxygen atoms in the molecule of nitric acid creates a larger surface area for the hydrogen atoms to donate electrons to, which allows for a stronger bond between the hydrogen and nitrogen atoms, resulting in a more acidic compound.",
