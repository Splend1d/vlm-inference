The acid donates a proton (H+) and the base accepts a proton.\n\nA. H3O+ and OH- are the conjugate acid-base pair in this case. The H3O+ is the acid that donates a proton (H+) to form water (H2O), and OH- is the base that accepts the proton.\n\nB. H3PO4 and H3PO3 are not the conjugate acid-base pair because H3PO4 is a strong acid and H3PO3 is a weak acid, but they are both acids.\n\nC. HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2- are not the conjugate acid-base pair because HC2H3O2 is a weak acid and C2H3O2- is a weak base, but they are both species.\n\nD.
