The Clayton Antitrust act\nB. The Hepburn Act\nC. The Sherman Antitrust Act\nD. The Pure Food and Drug Act\n\nassistant:The question is asking for a regulatory law that was passed as a result of Upton Sinclair's book \"The Jungle.\" \"The Jungle\" exposed the unsanitary conditions and worker exploitation in the meatpacking industry, leading to increased public demand for food safety regulations.\n\nAmong the options provided, the answer is D. The Pure Food and Drug Act. This law was passed in 1906, long before \"The Jungle\" was published. However, the book's exposure of the meatpacking industry's unsanitary conditions and worker exploitation did contribute to public demand for more stringent food safety regulations, which eventually led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) being established in 1906.",
