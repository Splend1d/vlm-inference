First, we rewrite the equation as $3^{x^2+4x+4}=(3^2)^{x+2}$. Using the property $a^{mn}=(a^m)^n$, we can simplify this to $3^{x^2+4x+4}=3^{2(x+2)}$. Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $x^2+4x+4=2(x+2)$. Next, we can simplify this equation by distributing the 2 to get $x^2+4x+4=2x+4$. Subtracting $2x+4$ from both sides gives $x^2+2x=0$. Factoring out an $x$ gives $x(x+2)=0$. Therefore, the solutions are $x=0$ and $x=-2$. Thus, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $0+(-2)=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0",
