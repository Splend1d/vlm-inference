This relationship is an example of\n\nA. commensalism\nB. parasitism\nC. mutualism\nD. gravitropism\n\nassistant:Lampreys attaching to the skin of lake trout and absorbing nutrients from its body is an example of parasitism. Parasitism occurs when one organism (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the host organism. In this case, the lamprey benefits from the nutrients it absorbs from the lake trout, while the trout is negatively affected.\n\nA commensalism is a relationship where one organism benefits, while the other is neither benefited nor harmed. Mutualism is a relationship where both organisms benefit from the interaction. Gravitropism is the growth of a plant in response to gravity. These options do not describe the lamprey-lake trout relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is B. parasitism.",
