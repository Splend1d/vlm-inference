Treaties may only negotiated and concluded by the heads of State and ministers of foreign affairs\nC. Treaties are negotiated and signed only by the persons that bear the necessary 'full powers' and no person is presumed to hold such authority\nD. Treaties are concluded only by members of the diplomatic missions of States\n\nassistant:The answer is A. Treaties are concluded by the competent representatives of States. Heads of States, heads of governments, ministers of foreign affairs and heads of diplomatic missions are presumed to have such authority.\n\nA treaty is a binding international agreement between two or more countries. The authority to conclude a treaty on the part of States is determined by the constitutional or legal framework of each country. In general, the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties lies with the competent representatives of a State.\n\nIn most countries, heads of State, heads of government, ministers of foreign affairs, and heads of diplomatic missions are presumed to have the authority to conclude treaties. However, this authority may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the nature of the treaty in question.\n\nIt is important to note that not all persons within a country have the authority to conclude treaties. Only those who bear the necessary \"full powers\" are deemed competent to negotiate and sign treaties. These full powers are typically granted by the head of State or government in the form of a specific mandate or instructions.\n\nIn addition, treaties are often negotiated and concluded through diplomatic channels, which require the participation of diplomats accredited to the relevant country. However, this does not necessarily mean that only members of diplomatic missions can conclude treaties. The authority to conclude treaties may also be delegated to other officials or representatives of a country, depending on the specific circumstances and the nature of the treaty in question.\n\nIn summary, the authority to conclude a treaty on the part of States lies with the competent representatives of each country, including heads of State, heads of government, ministers of foreign affairs, and heads of diplomatic missions. These representatives are presumed to have the necessary authority to negotiate and conclude treaties, but they must bear the necessary \"full powers\" and be accredited to the relevant country.",
