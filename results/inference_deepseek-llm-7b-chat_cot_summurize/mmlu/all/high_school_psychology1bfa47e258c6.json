The fact that she failed to realize that the newspaper she was carrying would have made a great makeshift umbrella is an example of\n\nA. confirmation bias\nB. limited visualization\nC. functional fixedness\nD. conceptual constriction\n\nassistant:The user is describing an instance where Donia did not realize that the newspaper she was carrying could be used as an umbrella, which is an example of functional fixedness. Functional fixedness is a cognitive bias that limits our ability to perceive objects or tools in new ways beyond their intended purpose. In this case, Donia was unable to see the newspaper as a useful tool for protection from rain, as she was only able to visualize it in its traditional, folded form for reading. Therefore, the answer is C. functional fixedness.",
