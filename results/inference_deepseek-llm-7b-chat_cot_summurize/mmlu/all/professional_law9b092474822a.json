The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\nB. inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\nD. admissible as an admission.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege is a legal principle that protects communications between an attorney and their client from disclosure to third parties, including the government. In this case, the accountant's proposed testimony would be considered confidential communications between the accountant and the taxpayer's attorney, and therefore should not be admissible in court.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination does not apply in this situation. This privilege protects individuals from being compelled to testify against themselves, but it does not apply to third parties like the accountant.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the work-product rule does not apply in this case. The work-product rule generally protects documents and materials prepared by a party in anticipation of litigation from being discovered by the other party or a court. However, it does not apply to communications between a client and their attorney, which is the issue at hand here.\n\nOption D is incorrect because an admission is not a valid basis for excluding evidence under the attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between an attorney and their client, not the outcome of those communications.",
