Archaeologists seek to understand the past by examining physical evidence, such as artifacts, architecture, and human remains, and by conducting systematic research and analysis. They are constrained by the evidence they find, and their interpretations are based on the evidence they have uncovered.\n\nPseudoscientific speculation and fantasies about ancient extraterrestrials, on the other hand, do not follow the scientific method and are not constrained by evidence or lack thereof. They are based on unproven theories or personal beliefs, and are not supported by empirical evidence.\n\nTherefore, archaeology differs from pseudoscientific speculation and fantasies about ancient extraterrestials because archaeologists follow the scientific method and are constrained by evidence or lack of evidence.",
