A two-sample t-test of population means\n\nTo compare the mean salaries of the math and English teachers, we would use a two-sample t-test of population means. This test is appropriate when the samples are independent and the variances are equal. In this case, the teachers are likely independent and have the same variance, as they are all from the same school.",
