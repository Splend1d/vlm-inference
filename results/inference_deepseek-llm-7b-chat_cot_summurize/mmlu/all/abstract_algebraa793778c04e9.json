Statement 2 | Every field is an integral domain.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.\nThis statement is true. The unity of a subring is the identity element of the subring, and the unity of the ring is the identity element of the ring. Therefore, they must be the same.\n\nStatement 2: Every field is an integral domain.\nThis statement is false. A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. An integral domain, on the other hand, is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is always non-zero. Therefore, not every field is an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
