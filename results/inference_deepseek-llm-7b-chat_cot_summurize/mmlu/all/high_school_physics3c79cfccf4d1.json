People stand inside the cylinder against the wall as it begins to spin. Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person\u2019s clothing and the wall is \u03bc, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?\n\nA. \u03bcv^2/(rg)\nB. r^2v^2/(\u03bcg)\nC. rg/(\u03bcv^2)\nD. None of the above.\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum mass that a person can be on the Gravitron ride safely. We can start by considering the frictional force between the person's clothing and the wall.\n\nThe frictional force between two surfaces in contact is given by the formula F = \u03bc * N, where F is the frictional force, \u03bc is the coefficient of friction, and N is the normal force. In this case, the normal force is equal to the gravitational force acting on the person, so N = mg, where m is the mass of the person and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWhen the floor of the Gravitron is removed, the person's weight is supported only by the frictional force between their clothing and the wall. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nmg = \u03bc * N\nmg = \u03bc * mg\nmg = \u03bc * mg\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for \u03bc and N:\n\nmg = \u03bc * mg\nmg = \u03bc * (mg)\nmg = \u03bc * mg\n\nSince \u03bc is the coefficient of friction between the person's clothing and the wall, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nmg = mg * \u03bc\n\nNow, divide both sides by mg:\n\n1 = \u03bc\n\nSince \u03bc is a dimensionless quantity, it must be a fraction:\n\n1 = \u03bc / 1\n\nThis means that the coefficient of friction between the person's clothing and the wall is 1.\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for \u03bc and N in the expression for the tangential speed:\n\nv = sqrt(N / R)\n\nSince N = mg, we have:\n\nv = sqrt(mg / R)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for N and R in the expression for the maximum mass:\n\nA. \u03bcv^2/(rg)\n\nA. \u03bc * v^2 / (rg)\n\nSince \u03bc is equal to 1, we have:\n\nA. v^2 / (rg)\n\nFinally, we can substitute the expression for v:\n\nA. v^2 / (rg)\n\n= (sqrt(mg / R))^2 / (rg)\n\n= (mg / R) / (rg)\n\n= (mg) / (R * g)\n\n= mg / (R * g)\n\n= m / (R * g)\n\nTherefore, the maximum mass that a person can be on the Gravitron ride safely is m / (R * g).",
