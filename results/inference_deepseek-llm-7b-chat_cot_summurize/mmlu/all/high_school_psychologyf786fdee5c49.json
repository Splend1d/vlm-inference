At first, she praises the student for playing correct notes. After the student begins to show proficiency with the notes, the teacher only praises the student when he adds the proper dynamics and interpretation to the segments he plays. The teacher's method of instruction is an example of which of the following types of training techniques?\n\nA. Negative reinforcement\nB. Negative punishment\nC. Shaping\nD. Chaining\n\nassistant:The teacher's method of instruction can be described as shaping. Shaping is a training technique in which a desired behavior is gradually established through the presentation of increasingly precise or specific stimuli. In this case, the teacher starts by praising the student for playing correct notes, and then gradually increases the level of praise when the student also adds the proper dynamics and interpretation to the segments he plays. This approach is different from negative reinforcement, which involves eliminating an aversive stimulus when the desired behavior occurs, and also different from chaining, which involves pairing two behaviors together to create a new one. Negative punishment, on the other hand, involves the removal of a reinforcing stimulus when the desired behavior does not occur.",
