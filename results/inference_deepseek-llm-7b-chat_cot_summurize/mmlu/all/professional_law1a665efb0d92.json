The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\nC. inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\nD. inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.\n\nassistant:B. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\n\nThe former employee's testimony is admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that tends to show a fact indirectly, based on other evidence. In this case, the fact that the manufacturer created a new design three weeks after the player's injury could suggest a connection between the old design and the player's injury. However, it is important to note that the fact that the manufacturer created a new design is not sufficient to prove that the old design was defective and caused the player's injury. The manufacturer's new design would need to be compared to industry standards, and the player's injury would need to be compared to the new design's defects in order to establish a causal link between the two.",
