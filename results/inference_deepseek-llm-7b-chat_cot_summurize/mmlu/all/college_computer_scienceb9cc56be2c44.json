The threat is often permanent until the entire disk is wiped clean.\n\nKilling the process or rebooting the operating system may temporarily resolve the issue, but it does not address the underlying problem. The malicious process may have already caused damage to the system, and the malware it installed may still be present on the system.\n\nReplacing files that show a virus infection may help to remove the immediate symptoms of the infection, but it does not address the underlying problem. The malware may have infected other files or components of the system, and may continue to cause damage.\n\nTherefore, it is important to take immediate action to address the threat by wiping the entire disk and reinstalling the operating system, as well as scanning the system for malware and implementing appropriate security measures to prevent future infections.",
