The pH of the solution gradually decreases throughout the experiment and the pH at the equivalence point is below 7.\n\nThis is because the weak base is added to the strong acid until the reaction is complete, and the pH will decrease gradually until it reaches the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, the weak base is completely neutralized by the strong acid, and the pH will decrease rapidly to a value below 7.",
