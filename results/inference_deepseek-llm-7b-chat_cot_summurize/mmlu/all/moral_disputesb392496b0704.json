Eugenics and genetic enhancement could potentially lead to unwanted changes in these areas. For example, selective breeding could lead to the creation of a \"superior\" class of humans, which could result in discrimination and inequality. Additionally, genetic enhancement could lead to a decrease in solidarity, as some individuals may have access to better healthcare and resources than others, leading to a widening gap between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. all of the above. Eugenics and genetic enhancement could lead to unwelcome changes in humility, responsibility, and solidarity.",
