If 0.0623 gram of metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen at STP, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is\n\nA. 98.6 g\nB. 493 g\nC. 24.7 g\nD. 49.3 g\n\nassistant:To determine the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction. We know that 0.0623 grams of metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen at STP. We can use the ideal gas law to convert the volume of hydrogen produced to moles of hydrogen produced.\n\nThe ideal gas law states that PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. At STP, the pressure is 101325 Pa and the temperature is 273.15 K. We can use the ideal gas law to convert the volume of hydrogen produced to moles of hydrogen produced:\n\n28.3 mL * (1/36) L/mL * (8.314 J/(mol\u2022K) * (273.15 K) / (101325 Pa)) = 0.00021 moles\n\nSince 0.0623 grams of metal produces 0.00021 moles of hydrogen, we can calculate the molar mass of hydrogen:\n\n0.0623 grams / 0.00021 moles = 30 grams/mole\n\nNow we can calculate the mass of one mole of hydrogen:\n\n30 grams/mole * 1 mole = 30 grams\n\nFinally, we can calculate the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid:\n\n30 grams * 1 mole = 30 grams\n\nSo the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is 30 grams, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
