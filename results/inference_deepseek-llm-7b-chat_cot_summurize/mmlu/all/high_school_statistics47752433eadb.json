The most reasonable conclusion from the given information is that we should be 90% confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6 and 12 years. This conclusion is based on the fact that the 90% confidence interval estimate of the difference is (6, 12), which means that we are 90% certain that the true difference in life expectancies lies between 6 and 12 years.",
