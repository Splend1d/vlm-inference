Just ahead, the pedestrian noticed a private dinner club. As the pedestrian approached the club, he noticed a sign over the front door that read: \"ADMITTANCE TO MEMBERS ONLY. \" Although the pedestrian was not a member of the exclusive club, he entered the dimly lit club, found a door marked \"Gentlemen,\" and entered the restroom. Which of the following would best describe the pedestrian's legal status when he was in the restroom?\n\nA. Trespasser.\nB. Guest.\nC. Licensee.\nD. Invitee.\n\nassistant:The pedestrian's legal status when he was in the restroom would best be described as a Licensee. A licensee is a person who is invited onto the property for a specific purpose, such as using the restroom, and is owed a duty of care by the property owner to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. The fact that the sign over the front door read \"ADMITTANCE TO MEMBERS ONLY\" implies that the pedestrian was not a member of the club, but he entered anyway, which means he was not a trespasser. Additionally, the fact that he found a door marked \"Gentlemen\" and entered the restroom suggests that he was invited onto the property for a specific purpose. Therefore, the best answer is C. Licensee.",
