The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\nassistant:The passage describes Hernando Cortes as a man filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise, who was not deterred by dangers and difficulties. It mentions that Cortes was a great general who achieved great achievements with the resources of his own genius. The passage also describes the diverse group of individuals who fought under Cortes' command, including adventurers, noblemen, and natives. Despite these differences, the passage states that this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, and to move on a common principle of action.\n\nFrom this perspective, William Hickling Prescott believed that Hernando Cortes was a great general, not primarily motivated by a desire for wealth, and that the diverse group of individuals fought under his command were able to work together despite their differences. Therefore, the answer is D: The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.",
