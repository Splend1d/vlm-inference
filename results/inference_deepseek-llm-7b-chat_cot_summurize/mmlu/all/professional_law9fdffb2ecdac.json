Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nThe defendant argued that she should have the burden of producing some evidence of duress, but the prosecution should be required to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court denied her request and instead instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. This is consistent with the common law rule that the defense of duress shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the jury instructions were correct, and the defendant's claim on appeal that they violated the due process clause is without merit.",
