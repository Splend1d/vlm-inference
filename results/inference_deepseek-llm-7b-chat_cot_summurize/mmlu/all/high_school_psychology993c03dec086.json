Optic nerve; ganglion cells; bipolar cells; rods and cones\nB. Bipolar cells; ganglion cells; fovea; optic nerve\nC. Rods and cones; retina; optic nerve; ganglion cells\nD. Rods and cones; bipolar cells; ganglion cells; optic nerve\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Optic nerve; ganglion cells; bipolar cells; rods and cones.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the order of the transmission of visual information:\n\n1. The eye detects light, which enters through the cornea, lens, and vitreous humor.\n2. The light is then focused on the retina, which is a layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye.\n3. The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for low-light vision, while cones are responsible for color vision and high-light vision.\n4. Bipolar cells receive signals from rods and cones and transmit them to ganglion cells.\n5. Ganglion cells then transmit the signals to the optic nerve, which carries the visual information to the brain.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. This option reverses the order of the transmission of visual information, starting with the optic nerve and ending with rods and cones.\nC. This option is almost correct, but it places bipolar cells before rods and cones.\nD. This option is also almost correct, but it places bipolar cells before rods and cones.",
