Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.\n\nThe court is more likely to grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants. The purchaser assumed the risk that a title search would not reveal any outstanding mortgages or liens on the property, and the seller had no legal responsibility to clear the mortgage before the conveyance. Therefore, the court would order the original four owners to make the mortgage payments and clear the lien from the property, rather than ordering the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage.",
