Aborigines have been occupying the harsh interior of Australia for thousands of years. They arrived in Australia at least 65,000 years ago, and by 40,000 years ago, they had already spread across the continent. Their presence in the interior dates back at least 20,000 to 25,000 years ago.\n\nDuring this time, the climate was much colder and wetter than it is today, and the interior was covered by a vast inland sea. The Aborigines had to adapt to this harsh environment and develop unique skills and technologies to survive. They were skilled in hunting, gathering, and fishing, and they used tools made from stone, wood, and animal hides. They also had a deep spiritual connection with the land and its natural resources.\n\nThe Aborigines' occupation of the harsh interior of Australia was not without challenges. They faced extreme temperatures, droughts, and lack of food, but they were resilient and innovative in finding ways to survive. They also had to deal with the arrival of European colonizers in the 18th and 19th centuries, which led to the loss of land and culture.\n\nToday, the Aborigines are the oldest continuous culture in the world, and their history and traditions are an essential part of Australia's identity.",
