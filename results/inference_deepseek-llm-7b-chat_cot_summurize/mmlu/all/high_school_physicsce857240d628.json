The temperature is increased in an isochoric process. Which of the following is NOT true?\n\nA. The average speed of the molecules increases.\nB. The pressure increases.\nC. The kinetic energy of the system increases.\nD. The volume increases.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The average speed of the molecules increases.\nThis is true. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to the temperature, the average speed of the molecules will increase.\n\nB. The pressure increases.\nThis is true as well. The pressure of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the temperature. Since the temperature is increased, the pressure will also increase.\n\nC. The kinetic energy of the system increases.\nThis is true. As mentioned earlier, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature. Since the temperature is increased, the kinetic energy of the system (which includes the molecules and the container) will increase.\n\nD. The volume increases.\nThis is false. The volume of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the temperature. Since the temperature is increased, the volume will decrease, not increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The volume does NOT increase.",
