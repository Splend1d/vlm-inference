If G is true and H is true, then ~G \u2283 H is true (T), and ~H / G is true (T). The argument is true when both sides are true, so it is valid.\n\n2. If G is true and H is false, then ~G \u2283 H is false (F), and ~H / G is false (F). The argument is false when both sides are false, so it is valid.\n\n3. If G is false and H is true, then ~G \u2283 H is false (F), and ~H / G is true (T). The argument is false when both sides are false, so it is invalid.\n\n4. If G is false and H is false, then ~G \u2283 H is false (F), and ~H / G is false (F). The argument is false when both sides are false, so it is invalid.\n\nThe answer is A. Valid.",
