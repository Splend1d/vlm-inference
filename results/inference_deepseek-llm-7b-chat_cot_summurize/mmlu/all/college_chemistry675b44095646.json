MgO\nB. MgS\nC. NaF\nD. NaCl\n\nassistant:To determine the lattice enthalpy of each ionic substance, we need to look at the average distance between the cations and anions in the crystal lattice. The lattice enthalpy is a measure of the energy required to break a mole of these bonds in the crystal structure.\n\nA. MgO - Magnesium Oxide:\nLattice enthalpy = 412 kJ/mol\n\nB. MgS - Magnesium Sulfide:\nLattice enthalpy = 294 kJ/mol\n\nC. NaF - Sodium Fluoride:\nLattice enthalpy = 122 kJ/mol\n\nD. NaCl - Sodium Chloride:\nLattice enthalpy = 480 kJ/mol\n\nBased on the lattice enthalpy values, the ionic substance with the greatest lattice enthalpy is NaCl (Sodium Chloride) with 480 kJ/mol.",
