Which of the following represents a position of stable equilibrium?\n\nA. x = \u20134\nB. x = \u20132\nC. x = 0\nD. x = 4\n\nassistant:To find the position of stable equilibrium, we need to find the point where the potential energy is minimized. The potential energy function is U(x) = (x \u2013 2)3 \u2013 12x.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the potential energy function with respect to x:\n\ndU/dx = d(x\u00b3 - 12x)/dx = 3x\u00b2 - 12\n\nNow, let's set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x to find the points of potential energy minima:\n\n0 = 3x\u00b2 - 12\nx\u00b2 = 4\nx = \u00b12\n\nNow, let's evaluate the potential energy function at each of these points:\n\nU(-2) = (-2 - 2)\u00b3 - 12(-2) = 10\nU(2) = (2 - 2)\u00b3 - 12(2) = 10\nU(0) = (0 - 2)\u00b3 - 12(0) = -24\nU(-4) = (-4 - 2)\u00b3 - 12(-4) = -28\n\nComparing the values of potential energy, we can see that the potential energy is minimized at x = 0, which corresponds to option C.",
