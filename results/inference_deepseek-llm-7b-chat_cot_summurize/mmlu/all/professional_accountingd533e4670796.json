You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: The standard deviations of Stocks A and B are respectively 6% and 18%. If their correlation is 0.2 and an equal weighted portfolio is formed, what is the standard deviation of such a portfolio?\n\nA. 10%\nB. 5%\nC. 3.40%\nD. 9.70%\n\nassistant:Let's use the formula for the standard deviation of a portfolio:\n\n\u03c3P = \u221a(w^2 * \u03c3A^2 + (1-w)^2 * \u03c3B^2 + 2 * w * (1-w) * \u03c3A * \u03c3B * \u03c1)\n\nwhere \u03c3P is the standard deviation of the portfolio, w is the weight of Stocks A, \u03c3A is the standard deviation of Stock A, \u03c3B is the standard deviation of Stock B, and \u03c1 is the correlation between the two stocks.\n\nGiven that the standard deviations of Stocks A and B are 6% and 18%, respectively, and the correlation between them is 0.2:\n\n\u03c3P = \u221a(w^2 * 0.06^2 + (1-w)^2 * 0.18^2 + 2 * w * (1-w) * 0.06 * 0.18 * 0.2)\n\nTo find the standard deviation of the portfolio, we need to determine the value of w. We can do this by setting up an equation and solving for w.\n\nUsing the fact that the total weight of the portfolio is 100%:\n\n1 = w + (1-w)\n2 = w * (1-w)\n\nNow we can solve for w:\n\nw = 1/3\n\nNow we can plug w = 1/3 into the formula for \u03c3P:\n\n\u03c3P = \u221a((1/3)^2 * 0.06^2 + (2/3)^2 * 0.18^2 + 2 * (1/3) * (2/3) * 0.06 * 0.18 * 0.2)\n\u03c3P = \u221a(0.0168 + 0.2888 + 0.0864)\n\u03c3P = \u221a(0.3828)\n\u03c3P \u2248 0.340%\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3.40%.",
