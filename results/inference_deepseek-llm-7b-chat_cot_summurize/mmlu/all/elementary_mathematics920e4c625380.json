The basketball player scored 18 points in his first game.\n2. The player scored 4 points fewer in his second game.\n\nWe can write an equation to represent this information:\n\n18 = p - 4 (Option B)\n\nNow we can solve for p:\n\np = 18 + 4\np = 22\n\nSo the player scored 22 points in his second game. The correct answer is Option B: 18 = p \u2212 4; 22.",
