The example given is to show that private clubs have the right to exclude outsiders, as they regularly arrange noisy late-night gatherings. This can also be seen as an example of how the actions of a group (the club members) can affect members outside of that group (the residents who live near the club). Additionally, it can be seen as an example of how there is no difference between an individual's and a group's freedom of association, as the club has the right to associate with its members and hold gatherings, while outsiders are excluded.",
