This means that we should avoid using violent and harmful tactics to combat terrorism, and instead focus on addressing the root causes of the problem. This approach emphasizes the importance of protecting human rights and avoiding harm to innocent civilians, which aligns with option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B. we avoid harming terrorists to the same extent that we would avoid harming innocent civilians.",
