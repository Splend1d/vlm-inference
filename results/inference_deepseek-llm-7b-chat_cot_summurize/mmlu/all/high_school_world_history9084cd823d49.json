The supremacy of piety\n\nassistant:The views expressed in this journal passage are best seen as evidence of the supremacy of piety. The passage describes Aden, a hot and barren port city with little vegetation or water, as a hub of trade between India and the Middle East. It mentions that the inhabitants are merchants, porters, and fishermen, and that some of them are immensely rich. Despite their wealth, they are described as pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treating strangers well and giving liberally to devotees. The passage also mentions that they pay in full the tithes due to God, indicating their strong religious beliefs and practices. This suggests that piety was highly valued and esteemed in medieval Islamic societies.",
