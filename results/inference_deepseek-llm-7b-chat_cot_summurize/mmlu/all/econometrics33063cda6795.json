(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nExplanation:\n\ni) This statement is true. A triangular or recursive system cannot be estimated using OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) on each equation separately because the error terms in the other equations will be correlated with the error terms in the current equation, leading to biased parameter estimates.\n\nii) This statement is also true. The independent variables in a triangular or recursive system may be correlated with the error terms in other equations, which can lead to biased parameter estimates.\n\niii) This statement is true. An application of 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) will not lead to unbiased parameter estimates because the error term in the first stage will be correlated with the error term in the second stage, resulting in biased estimates.\n\niv) This statement is also true. The independent variables in a triangular or recursive system may be correlated with the error terms in their own equations, which can lead to biased parameter estimates.",
