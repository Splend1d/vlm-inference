The equation E = mc^2 states that energy is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by the square of the object's speed of light. This equation, proposed by Albert Einstein, shows a deep connection between mass and energy, and demonstrates that they are interchangeable.\n\nTo provide more context, let's break down the options:\n\nA. The equation E = mc^2 indicates that energy equals mass moving at the speed of light squared. This is the correct interpretation of the equation, as it shows the equivalence of mass and energy.\n\nB. The equation E = mc^2 does not imply that energy equals moving mass. Rather, it shows that energy is equal to mass, which means that they are interchangeable.\n\nC. The equation E = mc^2 does not demonstrate that energy is fundamentally different than mass. Rather, it shows that they are interchangeable and can be converted between one another.\n\nD. The equation E = mc^2 does not imply that energy and mass are closely related. Rather, it shows that they are interchangeable and can be converted between one another.",
