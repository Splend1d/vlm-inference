The median of the team's scores is\n\nA. 9\nB. 8\nC. 7.5\nD. 7\n\nassistant:To find the median, we need to first arrange the scores in ascending order and then find the middle value.\n\nThe scores in ascending order are: 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10.\n\nSince there are an even number of scores (12), the median will be the average of the two middle values (the 6th and 7th values).\n\nThe 6th value is 7 and the 7th value is also 7.\n\nSo, the median of Brian's team's scores is the average of 7 and 7, which is (7 + 7) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 7.",
