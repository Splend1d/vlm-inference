First, we need to find the points of intersection between the three curves.\n\nSetting x^2 = cos(x), we find that x = 0 is the only real root of this equation. Therefore, the curves y = x^2 and y = cos(x) intersect at x = 0, and the region we are interested in is the region above the line y = x^2 and below the curve y = cos(x) and the y-axis.\n\nNow, we can integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, \u221e):\n\nArea = \u222b(x^2 - cos(x)) dx from 0 to \u221e\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nArea = [x^3/3 - sin(x)] from 0 to \u221e\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nArea = (0^3/3 - sin(0)) - [(\u221e)^3/3 - sin(\u221e)]\nArea = 0 - (-3/3) - [\u221e - 0]\nArea = 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
