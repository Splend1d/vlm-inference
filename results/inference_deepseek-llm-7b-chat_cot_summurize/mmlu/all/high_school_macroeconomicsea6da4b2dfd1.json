This means that the total government spending (expenditure) and the total government taxes (revenue) will remain the same after the policy change.\n\nThe MPC (Multiplier for Government Expenditure) is 0.75, which means that for every $1 increase in government spending, there will be an additional $0.75 increase in GDP. Therefore, the total increase in GDP will be $2.25 (1 + 0.75) for the $1 increase in government spending.\n\nThe MPC for taxes is not given, so we can't determine the exact tax multiplier. However, since the government is increasing spending and taxes by the same amount, we can assume that the tax multiplier is also 0.75. This means that for every $1 increase in government taxes, there will be an additional $0.75 increase in GDP. Therefore, the total increase in GDP will be $2 (1 + 0.75) for the $1 increase in government taxes.\n\nSince the government is keeping a balanced budget by increasing spending and taxes by the same amount, the net increase in government spending and taxes will be zero. Therefore, the total increase in GDP will also be zero. This means that the government's policy change will have no effect on the economy.\n\nHowever, since the government is increasing spending and taxes by the same amount, we can still calculate the total increase in government spending and taxes. The total increase in government spending will be $1 (the initial spending increase), and the total increase in government taxes will also be $1. Therefore, the total increase in government spending and taxes will be $2 (1 + 1).\n\nFinally, since the total increase in government spending and taxes will be $2, and the MPC for government spending is 0.75, we can calculate the total increase in GDP by multiplying the MPC by the total increase in government spending: 0.75 \\* 2 = $1.50. This means that the government's policy change will increase GDP by $1.50.\n\nIn summary, the government's policy change will have no effect on the economy, but will increase GDP by $1.50. Therefore, the correct answer is B. expansionary 4 3.",
