He sent 190 of the muffins to a local hotel. He will put the rest of the muffins in boxes. Each box can hold 6 muffins. Which equation can be used to find 6, the number of boxes the baker will need?\n\nA. (232 - 190)/6=b\nB. (232 + 190)x6=b\nC. (232 - 190)x6=b\nD. (232 + 190)/6=b\n\nassistant:To find the number of boxes the baker will need, we can use the equation (232 - 190)x6=b.\n\n(232 - 190) is the number of muffins left after sending 190 muffins to the hotel, and x6 is the number of muffins in each box.\n\n(232 - 190) x 6 = b\n42 x 6 = b\n\nb = 252\n\nThe baker will need 252/6 = 42 boxes.\nThe answer is: 42",
