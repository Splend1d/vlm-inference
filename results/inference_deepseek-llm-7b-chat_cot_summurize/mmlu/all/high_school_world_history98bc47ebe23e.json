Central Asia\nB. Europe\nC. The Middle East\nD. The New World\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to identify the source of the additional two hundred thousand coins in silver that the Portuguese bring yearly from India.\n\nFrom the text, we can see that the Portuguese not only bring silver from Japan but also silver from India. The question specifically asks about the volume of additional silver, which is not mentioned in the first paragraph.\n\nTherefore, we need to look for additional information in the text that provides more details about the silver trade with India.\n\nThe text states: \"They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China.\"\n\nFrom this, we can see that the additional silver comes from India, not Japan.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The New World. The text does not provide enough information to determine the source of the silver from Central Asia or the Middle East.\n\nSo, the final answer is: D. The New World.",
