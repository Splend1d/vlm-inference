So, ~C \u2283 D is true.\n   - When C is false, ~C is true, and D can be either true or false. So, ~C \u2283 D is false.\n\n2. D \u2283 C (D implies C):\n   - When D is true, C can be either true or false. So, D \u2283 C is true.\n   - When D is false, C can be either true or false. So, D \u2283 C is false.\n\n3. C (C):\n   - When C is true, C is true.\n   - When C is false, C is false.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conditional statements:\n\n1. ~C \u2283 D (Negation of C implies D):\n   - When D is true, ~C \u2283 D is false.\n   - When D is false, ~C \u2283 D is true.\n\n2. D \u2283 C (D implies C):\n   - When C is true, D \u2283 C is true.\n   - When C is false, D \u2283 C is false.\n\n3. C (C):\n   - When C is true, C is true.\n   - When C is false, C is false.\n\nThe argument is not valid, as there are cases where the statements do not follow the given rules. For example, when C and D are both true, ~C \u2283 D is false, and when C is true and D is false, D \u2283 C is false. This means that the argument is invalid.",
