This is because the power output is proportional to the product of the torque and speed. By adjusting the field flux, the torque can be controlled, which in turn maintains the power output constant.\n\nOption B is incorrect because torque is not constant when the field flux is varied. Option C is also incorrect because the power output is not variable when the field flux is varied. Option D is incorrect because the correct answer is A.",
