Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the terms of the contract were not recorded and preserved at the time of signing the contract.\n\nassistant:The parol evidence rule is a legal principle that generally prevents the introduction of prior oral agreements or conversations into evidence to contradict or modify a written contract. In this case, the parties signed a written contract for the sale of ten thousand pounds of \"quality salmon\" for $50,000, which specifically referred to \"quality salmon.\" Upon delivery, the buyer discovered that the salmon was a mix of pacific wild salmon, domestic salmon raised in captivity, and mixed east coast salmon, which were inferior types. The buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract is in issue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used, and the parol evidence rule does not prevent such testimony.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the contract was not reduced to writing, but was instead signed orally.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the terms of the contract were recorded and preserved at the time of signing the contract, in the written contract.\n\nOption B is correct. The parol evidence rule does apply to preclude the buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract because the testimony would add to or contradict the final signed writing. The parol evidence rule is designed to ensure the finality of written contracts, and any prior oral agreements or conversations should not be considered to modify or contradict the written contract.",
