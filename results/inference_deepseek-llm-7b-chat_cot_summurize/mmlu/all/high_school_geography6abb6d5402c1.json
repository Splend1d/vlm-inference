Reference maps are often used to provide a general overview of a region and can be useful for finding the global distribution of resources such as coal.\n\nB. Topographic maps show the relief or terrain of an area, such as mountains, valleys, and other natural features. They are not typically used to find the global distribution of resources.\n\nC. Thematic maps show specific types of information, such as population density, climate, or land use. While they can be useful for understanding the distribution of certain features or activities, they are not the best choice for finding the global distribution of resources.\n\nD. Location maps show the exact location of specific locations, such as cities or landmarks. They are not typically used to find the global distribution of resources.",
