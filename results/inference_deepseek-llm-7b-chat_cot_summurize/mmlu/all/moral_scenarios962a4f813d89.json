Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong. In Scenario 1, the main character breaks open their piggy bank to buy a doll. This is a morally wrong action because the piggy bank was meant for saving money, and the character is wasting their savings on a doll. In Scenario 2, the main character wipes the soap out of the tub to prevent their grandma from slipping. This is a morally right action because the main character is trying to prevent harm and protect their grandma.",
