This includes deciding which amendments will be considered, and in what order. The committee also has the power to limit the number of amendments that can be offered on a particular bill, and to limit the amount of time that members have to speak on the floor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the House Ethics Committee is responsible for investigating allegations of ethical misconduct by House members.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the selection of federal judges is the responsibility of the Senate.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the number of subcommittees that a standing committee may establish at any given time is determined by the House Administration Committee.",
