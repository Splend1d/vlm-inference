Coach Perry starts by rolling the ball to Lana slowly so she can stop it; he gradually begins to roll the ball faster and to different parts of the goal, all the while praising her successful attempts. The technique Coach Perry is using is called\n\nA. the law of effect.\nB. the partial reinforcement effect.\nC. shaping.\nD. second-order conditioning.\n\nassistant:Coach Perry is using the technique called shaping. Shaping is a type of operant conditioning where a desired behavior is gradually made more specific through the use of positive reinforcement. In this case, when Lana successfully stops the ball, she receives praise, which is a form of positive reinforcement. This encourages her to repeat the behavior and eventually learn to stop the ball consistently.\n\nA. the law of effect - This is a principle in psychology that states that a certain behavior is more likely to be repeated if it leads to a positive outcome. This is not the technique being used in this scenario.\n\nB. the partial reinforcement effect - This refers to the process of providing reinforcement only some of the time, which can increase the frequency of a certain behavior. This is not the technique being used in this scenario.\n\nD. second-order conditioning - This is a type of conditioning in which a previously neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response through association with another stimulus. This is not the technique being used in this scenario.",
