Find the average pitch\n\nA. 10\nB. 100\nC. 50\nD. 1\n\nassistant:To find the average pitch of a DC machine with 100 conductors and 10 parallel paths, we can use the following formula:\n\nAverage pitch = (Number of conductors * Number of parallel paths) / (Number of conductors - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAverage pitch = (100 * 10) / (10 - 1)\nAverage pitch = (1000) / 9\nAverage pitch = 111.11\n\nHowever, this result is not one of the given options.
