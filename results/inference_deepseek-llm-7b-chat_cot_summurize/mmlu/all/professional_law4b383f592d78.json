The prosecution countered that the state's rules allowed for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days, and that the procedure was constitutional. Will the court most likely decide that this detention is unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination.\nB. No, because each case must be decided on its own facts and there may be many good reasons why the state has not yet provided a probable cause determination.\nC. Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\nD. No, because it is constitutional to hold someone for up to 15 days without a probable cause determination.\n",

The public defender's motion to dismiss alleges an unconstitutional detention in violation of due process, and the prosecution's argument that the state's rules allow for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days is not sufficient to render the detention constitutional. Therefore, the answer is C. Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.",
