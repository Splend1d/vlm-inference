Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character picks up a spider and shows it to someone who is afraid of spiders, which is clearly morally wrong, as it can cause fear and distress to the person.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character prays for rain, which is not necessarily morally wrong, as it depends on the context and intentions. However, the act of praying itself is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
