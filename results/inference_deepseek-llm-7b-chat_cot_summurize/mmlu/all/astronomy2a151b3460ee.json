Ozone transmits visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorbs most of the infrared heat trapping the heat near the surface.\nB. Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\nC. Greenhouse gases absorb infrared light from the Sun which then heats the atmosphere and the surface.\nD. Greenhouse gases absorb X-rays and ultraviolet light from the Sun which then heat the atmosphere and the surface.\n\nassistant:The greenhouse effect works through the absorption and re-emission of infrared radiation by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When the Sun emits radiation, about 30% of it is in the form of visible light, which is what our eyes perceive as sunlight. The rest of the radiation, about 70%, is in the form of infrared radiation.\n\nGreenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, have the ability to absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. When these gases absorb infrared radiation, they trap heat near the Earth's surface, which would otherwise escape into space. This trapped heat causes the Earth's surface to warm up, leading to the greenhouse effect.\n\nSo, the correct answer to your question is:\n\nB. Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.",
