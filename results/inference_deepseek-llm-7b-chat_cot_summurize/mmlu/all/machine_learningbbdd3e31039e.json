False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs.\nThis statement is false. Industrial-scale neural networks are often trained on GPUs, not CPUs. GPUs are specifically designed for parallel processing, making them ideal for training large neural networks.\n\nStatement 2: The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.\nThis statement is true. The ResNet-50 model, which is a convolutional neural network used in computer vision tasks, has over 1 billion parameters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.",
