This theory, also known as the theory of central places, is a concept in urban economics that explains the distribution of economic activity and the establishment of settlements. It states that market towns and cities are the centers of trade and commerce in their surrounding areas, and that they attract people and businesses to their central locations. The central place theory is based on the idea that people tend to travel to the most convenient and efficient location to purchase goods and services, and that this location is typically a market town or city.",
