Scenario 1 | I taught my cat to use the park's sandbox as a litterbox. Scenario 2 | I followed my brother home from school.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character taught their cat to use the park's sandbox as a litterbox. While this may not be the most ideal solution, it is not morally wrong. It is important to note that cats have a natural instinct to bury their waste, and the sandbox may serve as a convenient solution for the cat.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character followed their brother home from school. This action is not morally wrong either, as long as the brother does not feel uncomfortable or threatened by the situation.\n\nTherefore, neither of these scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
