First trimester of pregnancy.\nB. Second trimester of pregnancy.\nC. Third trimester of pregnancy.\nD. Effects were similar at all stages of pregnancy.\n\nassistant:The answer is D. Effects were similar at all stages of pregnancy.\n\nThe Dutch Hunger Winter, which occurred from October 1944 to May 1945, was a period of severe food shortages in the Netherlands during World War II. It is known that exposure to this event during pregnancy can have long-lasting effects on the health and well-being of the offspring. However, the study you mentioned found that in utero exposure to the Dutch Hunger Winter did not have a significant impact on DNA methylation levels in blood cells from the adult offspring during any specific stage of pregnancy. This suggests that the effects of in utero exposure to the Dutch Hunger Winter were similar across all stages of pregnancy.",
