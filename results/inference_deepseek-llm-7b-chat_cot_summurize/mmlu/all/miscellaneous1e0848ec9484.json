Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline serve to amplify tidal flow at specific localities.\n\nThe answer is C. Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline can affect the tidal range in a locality. The topography of the seafloor and the shape of the coastline can create channels and narrows that trap water, causing the water to rise and fall more dramatically, creating larger tidal ranges.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the position of the Sun is not the primary factor affecting tidal ranges.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the Coriolis effect and rotation of Earth tend to enhance tidal flow in the higher latitudes, not the lower latitudes where larger tidal ranges are typically found.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because trade winds push the water into large tidal bulges near rocky shorelines, but this is not the main factor affecting tidal ranges.",
