Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n\nThe court is likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000 because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause. A merger clause is a provision in a contract that states that the contract merges and replaces any prior agreements, understandings, or negotiations between the parties. If the written agreement had included a merger clause, the oral agreement would not be admissible as evidence in court. However, since there was no merger clause in the written agreement, the court may consider the orally agreed price of $100,000 as evidence.",
