Transition metals will lose their outermost s-block electrons when forming bonds.\n\nassistant:To determine the best answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Transition metals all have a minimum of two unpaired electrons.\n- This statement is not directly related to the oxidation state of +2. Unpaired electrons do not necessarily affect the oxidation state.\n\nB. Transition metals have unstable configurations and are very reactive.\n- This statement is also not directly related to the oxidation state of +2. Unstable configurations and reactivity do not necessarily affect the oxidation state.\n\nC. Transition metals tend to gain electrons when reacting with other elements.\n- This statement suggests that transition metals might have an increased tendency to acquire more electrons, which could result in an oxidation state of +2. This option seems plausible.\n\nD. Transition metals will lose their outermost s-block electrons when forming bonds.\n- This statement suggests that transition metals might lose electrons, which would result in a lower oxidation state. This option is unlikely.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is:\n\nC. Transition metals tend to gain electrons when reacting with other elements.",
