One is running a Web server and the other is running a Web browser. Which of the following best describes the ability of the two computers to communicate with each other across the Internet?\n\nA. The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\nB.

The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers.\nD. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n\nassistant:D. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n\nExplanation: In this case, the two computers are built by different manufacturers, but they can still communicate with each other across the Internet because the Internet uses standard communication protocols, such as TCP/IP. These protocols enable different devices from various manufacturers to communicate with each other. Therefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect.",
