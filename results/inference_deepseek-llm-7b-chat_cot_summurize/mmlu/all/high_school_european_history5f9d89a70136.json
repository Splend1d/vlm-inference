He uses this as an example of the extreme tendencies of the German people, and how these tendencies led to their \"catastrophe\" in 1914. He does not directly attribute the start of the war to the song or the national anthem, but rather uses it as an example of the extreme nationalistic attitude that he believes led to Germany's misfortune.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B: that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland \ufffdber alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were evidence of Germany's aggressive attitude. The passage does not mention any of the other options, so they are not correct.",
