Based on the separate sovereignty doctrine, Congress does not have authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court.\n\nassistant:The strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute would be that it contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court. The Constitution establishes a single Supreme Court as the highest court in the land, with the power to review cases brought before it. By dividing the Court into two panels, this statute undermines that single, unified court. It creates a situation in which decisions made by one panel could be potentially undermined or overturned by decisions made by the other panel, which is contrary to the principles of a unified Supreme Court. This could potentially lead to conflicts and inconsistencies in the interpretation and application of the law, which is a significant concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the other options do not necessarily undermine the constitutionality of the statute. The statute may not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress, but that does not necessarily make it unconstitutional. Similarly, the doctrine of judicial supremacy or the separate sovereignty doctrine may argue that Congress lacks authority to make such a change, but that would not necessarily be a strong argument against the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nTherefore, the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute is that it contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.",
