Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character parks in their neighbor's driveway without asking them, which is considered rude and impolite. It is a clear breach of basic etiquette and respect for their neighbor's property.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character digs up the teacher's corpse and leaves it in her old classroom, which is morally reprehensible and a criminal act. It is a clear violation of the deceased teacher's rights and a disrespectful act towards the person and their family.",
