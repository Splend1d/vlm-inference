The Declaration of Covenants and the teacher's deed both contain the same restrictions as the lease, and the librarian is leasing the home from the teacher, who is bound by those restrictions. However, the librarian is not in a direct contractual relationship with the homeowners' association, and therefore may argue that they are not obligated to follow the rules set forth in the Declaration of Covenants. This argument would be similar to the \"non-mutual promise\" defense, which can sometimes be used to avoid liability for breaches of contract.",
