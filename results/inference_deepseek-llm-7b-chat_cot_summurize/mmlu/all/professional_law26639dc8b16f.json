No, the statute violates the First Amendment right to publish protected commercial speech.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech, which includes the right to publish and disseminate information, including commercial speech. In this case, the man was publishing information about how to obtain an abortion, which could be considered a commercial transaction. The statute making it a crime to disseminate such information would therefore likely be found to violate the First Amendment right to publish protected commercial speech.\n\nA.
