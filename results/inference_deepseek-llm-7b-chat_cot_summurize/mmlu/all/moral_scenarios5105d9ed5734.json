Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character is willing to pay for SAT prep courses to help their child get into Stanford. While this may be seen as morally questionable by some, it is not clear that it is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character prays for rain on the Fourth of July parade. This action does not involve any clear moral wrongdoing, so it is considered \"not wrong.\"",
