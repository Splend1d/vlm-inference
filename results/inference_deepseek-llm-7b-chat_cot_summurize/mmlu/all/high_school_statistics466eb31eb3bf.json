Almost everyone did poorly on the exam, and so for the second exam every student studied 10 hours. What is the correlation between the numbers of hours students studied for each exam?\n\nA. -1\nB. 0\nC. 0.4\nD. 1\n\nassistant:To find the correlation between the number of hours students studied for each exam, we can use the formula for the correlation coefficient between two variables:\n\nr = \u03a3[(x_i - x\u0304)(y_i - \u0233)] / \u221a[\u03a3(x_i - x\u0304)^2 * \u03a3(y_i - \u0233)^2]\n\nwhere x_i and y_i are the individual study hours for each exam, x\u0304 is the average study hours for the first exam, and \u0233 is the average study hours for the second exam.\n\nFirst, let's find x\u0304 and \u0233:\n\nx\u0304 = \u03a3x_i = 6 * 4 + 10 * 10 = 60 / 2 = 30 hours (total study hours for all students)\n\u0233 = \u03a3y_i = 6 * 10 + 10 * 4 = 120 / 2 = 60 hours (total study hours for both exams)\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator and denominator of the correlation coefficient formula:\n\n\u03a3[(x_i - x\u0304)(y_i - \u0233)] = 6 * (4-30)(10-60) + 10 * (10-30)(4-60) + 6 * (4-30)(10-60) + 10 * (10-30)(4-60) = 6 * (-26)(140) + 10 * (-40)(140) + 6 * (-26)(140) + 10 * (-40)(140) = 6 * 3640 + 10 * 5600 + 6 * 3640 + 10 * 5600 = 21840 + 56000 + 3640 + 56000 = 94440\n\n\u03a3(x_i - x\u0304)^2 = \u03a3(y_i - \u0233)^2 = 6 * (4-30)^2 + 10 * (10-30)^2 + 6 * (4-30)^2 + 10 * (10-30)^2 = 6 * 169 + 10 * 169 + 6 * 169 + 10 * 169 = 1014 + 1690 + 1014 + 1690 = 4448\n\n\u221a[\u03a3(x_i - x\u0304)^2 * \u03a3(y_i - \u0233)^2] = \u221a(4448 * 4448) = \u221a1986176 = 1986.176\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the correlation coefficient formula:\n\nr = 94440 / 1986.176 \u2248 46.84\n\nSince the answer should be between -1 and 1, the correct answer is not listed in the options. The correlation between the numbers of hours students studied for each exam is approximately 0.4684, which is not listed in the options.",
