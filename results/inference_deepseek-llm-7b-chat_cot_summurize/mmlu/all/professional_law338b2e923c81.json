As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse\u00d5s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable.

Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.\n\nassistant:The court is not likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions. The reason is that the attorney of the represented party is not subject to sanctions. The attorney's conduct is not the issue at hand, but rather the hospital's failure to provide the attorney with a chance to withdraw the complaint before filing the motion with the court. Therefore, the correct answer is B. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.",
