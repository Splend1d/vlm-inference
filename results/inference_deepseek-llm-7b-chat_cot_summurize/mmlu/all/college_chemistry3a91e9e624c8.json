Momentum is known exactly, but no information about position can be known.\nB. Position is known exactly, but no information about momentum can be known.\nC. No information about either position or momentum can be known.\nD. Neither position nor momentum can be known exactly.\n\nassistant:The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum for a quantum mechanical particle is greater than or equal to a constant value, known as Planck's constant divided by 4\u03c0. Mathematically, this can be expressed as \u0394x*\u0394p >= \u0127/2, where \u0394x and \u0394p are the uncertainties in position and momentum, respectively.\n\nWhen a quantum mechanical particle is in the lowest energy level of a one-dimensional box, it is confined to a specific energy level. This means that its momentum is quantized, and it can only have certain discrete values corresponding to the allowed energy levels.\n\nIn this case, the uncertainty in momentum, \u0394p, is related to the energy difference between the energy levels. The larger the energy difference, the smaller the uncertainty in momentum. However, this does not affect the uncertainty in position, \u0394x, which is always greater than zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that neither position nor momentum can be known exactly. This is represented by option D.",
