No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\n\nThe statute is likely to be held unconstitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state. This is because the act would violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, which prohibits the state from regulating activities that are part of interstate commerce. The state legislature's act of prohibiting gambling at privately owned casinos in the state would be seen as an interference with interstate commerce, which is not allowed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the act was not expressly authorized by the state legislature. Option B is incorrect because the local interest in safety does not outweigh the burden of interstate commerce. Option D is incorrect because the due process rights of the owners of the casinos are not violated in this case.",
