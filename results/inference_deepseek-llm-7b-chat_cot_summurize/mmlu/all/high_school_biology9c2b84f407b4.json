Most enzymes in the lysosome, however, are only active at a pH of 5. This suggests that\n\nA. only acidic substances can undergo enzymatic processing in lysosomes\nB. most enzymes in the lysosome are incapable of catalyzing substrates inside the lysosome\nC. enzymes in the lysosome are released to the cytosol\nD. protons are actively pumped into the lysosome\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. only acidic substances can undergo enzymatic processing in lysosomes.\n\nThe pH of the cytosol is about 7.2, which is slightly basic. However, most enzymes in the lysosome are only active at a pH of 5, which is acidic. This suggests that the lysosome maintains an acidic environment to allow these enzymes to function properly. Therefore, only acidic substances can undergo enzymatic processing in the lysosome.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it suggests that most enzymes in the lysosome are incapable of catalyzing substrates inside the lysosome, which is not supported by the information given. Answer C is incorrect because it suggests that enzymes in the lysosome are released to the cytosol, which is not mentioned in the information given. Answer D is incorrect because it suggests that protons are actively pumped into the lysosome, which is not mentioned in the information given.",
