The poor Indians were harshly punished, tortured, and died due to the harsh conditions in the mines. They were not paid for their labor, and their work was kept hidden. The mine owners used the pretext of mining chores to make the Indians herding cattle and conveying goods.\n\nThe English, on the other hand, viewed the natives as true equals as they settled the Americas. This is evident from the fact that the English did not engage in the same level of exploitation and abuse of the natives as the Spanish did. For instance, the English did not torture or punish the natives, and they did not use the pretext of mining chores to exploit the Indians.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the text does not mention any confusion about the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership. Option C is incorrect because the text does not mention any widespread condemnation of intermingling with the natives. Option D is incorrect because the text does not mention the English using the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops like tobacco and cotton.",
