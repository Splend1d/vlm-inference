Civil Law.\n\nCivil law is a system of laws that deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, and provides a means for resolving those disputes through legal procedures. It establishes rights and obligations between parties, and provides for remedies when those rights are violated. Criminal law, on the other hand, deals with the punishment of individuals who have committed crimes against the state or society as a whole. The Uniform Commercial Code is a set of rules that governs commercial transactions, such as contracts, negotiable instruments, and secured transactions. Stare decisis is a legal principle that means \"to stand by decisions,\" and refers to the practice of courts upholding previous decisions that are deemed to be correct and just.",
