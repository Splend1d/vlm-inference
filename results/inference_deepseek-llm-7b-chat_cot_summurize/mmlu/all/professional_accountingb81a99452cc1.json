What is the expected return of an equal weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C?\n\nA. 10%\nB. 8.50%\nC. 6%\nD. 12%\n\nassistant:To calculate the expected return of an equal weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C, we need to take into account the expected returns of both securities and their respective weights in the portfolio.\n\nLet's assume that the weight of Security A in the portfolio is 50%, and the weight of Security C is also 50%. Therefore, the total weight of the portfolio is 100%.\n\nThe expected return of an equal weighted portfolio can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Return of Equal Weighted Portfolio = (Expected Return of Security A \\* Weight of Security A) + (Expected Return of Security C \\* Weight of Security C)\n\nExpected Return of Equal Weighted Portfolio = (7% \\* 0.50) + (5% \\* 0.50)\n\nExpected Return of Equal Weighted Portfolio = 3.50% + 2.50%\n\nExpected Return of Equal Weighted Portfolio = 6%\n\nTherefore, the expected return of an equal weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is 6%, which corresponds to option C.",
