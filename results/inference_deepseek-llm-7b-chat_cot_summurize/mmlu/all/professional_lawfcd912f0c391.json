The court should schedule a jury trial of both the city's claim and the team's counterclaim.\n\nassistant:The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and then a jury trial of the issues remaining in the team's counterclaim (Option C).\n\nThe court should first address the city's claim for a permanent injunction, as it is a more urgent matter that requires immediate resolution. If the court grants the injunction, it will prevent the team from leaving the stadium, and the counterclaim would become moot.\n\nAfter resolving the city's claim, the court can then proceed to the team's counterclaim. The team has demanded a jury trial on its counterclaim, so the court should schedule a jury trial for that issue.\n\nDuring the jury trial of the team's counterclaim, the court can consider the city's claim for an injunction without giving binding effect to its findings or conclusions. This is because the jury trial of the counterclaim will address the team's allegations of the city's failure to maintain the stadium, which may be relevant to the city's claim for an injunction.\n\nBy following this approach, the court can efficiently address both the city's claim for an injunction and the team's counterclaim while ensuring that the jury trial of the counterclaim is held in a separate proceeding from the nonjury trial of the city's injunction claim.",
