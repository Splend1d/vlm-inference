Scenario 1 | I chopped down the trees intended for apples. Scenario 2 | I returned the used underwear to the store.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character chops down trees that were intended for growing apples. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 because it involves harming living organisms (the trees) for the sake of human consumption (apples).\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character returns used underwear to the store. This action does not involve any harm to living organisms or any form of theft or deception, so it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
