The piston is moved downward in a slow steady fashion allowing heat to escape the gas and the temperature to remain constant.

The ideal gas law is given by:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of moles of gas. We can do this using the formula:\n\nn = V / (V_f * V_i)\n\nwhere n is the number of moles, V is the final volume, and V_i and V_f are the initial and final volumes, respectively.\n\nV = 20 cm^3\nV_f = 5 cm^3\n\nn = 20 / (5 * 20) = 0.1 moles\n\nNow, we need to find the final temperature. We can use the formula:\n\nT_f = T_i * ((PV_f) / (RT_i)^(1/n))\n\nwhere T_f is the final temperature, T_i is the initial temperature, and P_f and R_i are the final and initial pressure and gas constant, respectively.\n\nT_i = 273 K\nP = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\nR = 8.314 J/(mol*K)\n\nT_f = 273 * ((1 \u00d7 10^5 * 5) / (8.314 * 273)^(1/0.1)) = 248 K\n\nNow, we can find the final pressure using the ideal gas law:\n\nP_f = n * R * T_f / V_f\n\nP_f = 0.1 * 8.314 * 248 / 5 = 0.25 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nSo, the resulting pressure is 0.25 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.
