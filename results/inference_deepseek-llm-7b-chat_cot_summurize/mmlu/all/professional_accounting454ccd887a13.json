Discuss the potential financial statement adjustments with client management.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Discuss the potential financial statement adjustments with client management.\n\nIf a CPA discovers that the accounts receivable confirmation process omitted a number of accounts that are material, in the aggregate, they should discuss the potential financial statement adjustments with client management. This would involve determining the impact of the omitted accounts on the financial statements and discussing the appropriate adjustments to be made.\n\nOption A is not the immediate action to take, as it would depend on the severity and implications of the discovery. Option B is not necessary, as the auditor's report is based on the audit evidence obtained and the professional judgment of the auditor, and the omission of a few accounts should not invalidate the report. Option C is also not the immediate action, as it would require additional time and resources to perform alternative procedures to verify account balances.",
