The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.\n\nThe talk show host did not provide any information about how many people actually responded to his e-mail address, nor did he mention if the people who responded were representative of the general population. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the 82% figure is accurate or meaningful. It is also possible that the people who responded were more likely to support the death penalty, which would lead to a bias in the results.",
