MgSO4 7H2O is not a compound used for powering a car.\n\nB. blow up a building - This option is not relevant to the compound. MgSO4 7H2O is not a compound used for blowing up a building.\n\nC. soak ones feet - This option is somewhat relevant to the compound. MgSO4 7H2O is a common ingredient in some foot soaking solutions due to its ability to help soften hard skin.\n\nD. fertilize a lawn - This option is the most relevant to the compound. MgSO4 7H2O is used as a fertilizer due to its ability to release magnesium and sulfur, which are essential nutrients for plants.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely thing one would do with the compound MgSO4 7H2O is to fertilize a lawn.",
