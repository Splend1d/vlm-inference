The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise.\nD. Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the employee's act of saving the boss's life is considered \"sufficient past consideration\" to support the boss's subsequent promise of lifetime employment. This is because, in many jurisdictions, the act of saving someone's life is considered a valuable and valuable action that can create a valid contract between the two parties. Therefore, the boss's promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment can be considered enforceable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, although the boss's promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment may be considered enforceable, it does not necessarily mean that the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, while the boss may have a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, it does not necessarily mean that the boss's subsequent promise of lifetime employment is supported by a contract implied-in-fact.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, although the employee may have gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, it does not necessarily mean that there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise of lifetime employment.",
