The price elasticity of demand for a product is greater if the number of substitute products is limited. This is because if there are few substitute products, a small price change will have a larger effect on the quantity demanded, resulting in a higher price elasticity of demand.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the proportion of the good of the consumer's budget is not directly related to the price elasticity of demand.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the period of time to respond to a price change is not a direct determinant of price elasticity of demand.\n\nOption D is incorrect because whether a product is a necessity or not does not directly affect its price elasticity of demand.",
