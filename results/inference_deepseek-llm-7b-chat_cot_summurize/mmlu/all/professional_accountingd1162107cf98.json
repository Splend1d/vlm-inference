By recognizing $10,000 in profit or loss and $5,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nUnder IFRS, the revaluation model requires that the difference between the current fair value and the carrying amount of an asset be recognized as other comprehensive income (OCI). In this case, the fair value of the land increased from $90,000 to $105,000, which is a difference of $15,000. Therefore, the company should recognize $10,000 in profit or loss and $5,000 in OCI.",
