If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\nA. 164%\nB. 1.64%\nC. 0.45%\nD. 183%\n\nassistant:To calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment, we can use the following formula:\n\nEstimated yearly yield = (Total income - Total expenses) / Initial investment\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total income. The car is rented for $245 per hour, and it is estimated to be hired for 2 hours a day on average. Therefore, the total income per day is:\n\nTotal income per day = 245 * 2 = $490\n\nSince you work every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends, there are 365 days in a year. Therefore, the total income for the year is:\n\nTotal income for the year = 490 * 365 = $178,050\n\nNext, let's calculate the total expenses. We know that the daily costs are about $50, and you estimate that the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average. Therefore, the total expenses per day are:\n\nTotal expenses per day = 50 * 2 = $100\n\nThe total expenses for the year are:\n\nTotal expenses for the year = 100 * 365 = $36,500\n\nNow, we can calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment:\n\nEstimated yearly yield = (178,050 - 36,500) / 98,000 = 1.64\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 1.64%.",
