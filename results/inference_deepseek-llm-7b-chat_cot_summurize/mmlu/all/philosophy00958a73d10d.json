This is because, according to Aquinas, the ultimate goal of human existence is to attain the highest good, which is happiness or beatitude. This is achieved through the contemplation of God and the fulfillment of one's natural inclinations, which are oriented towards the good. The other options are not considered to be the last end of man by Aquinas. Pleasure is not considered to be the highest good, as it is a fleeting sensation that does not have lasting value. The satisfaction of desire is not considered to be the last end of man because it is not oriented towards the good, but rather towards self-gratification. Freedom from anxiety is not considered to be the last end of man because it is not a sufficient condition for happiness or beatitude, and it does not lead to the fulfillment of one's natural inclinations.",
