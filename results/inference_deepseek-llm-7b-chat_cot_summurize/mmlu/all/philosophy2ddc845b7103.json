In the Republic, this idea is a central theme and is often associated with Thrasymachus. He argues that justice is simply a means for the stronger to control the weaker, and that it is not a virtue in itself. This idea is later challenged by Socrates, who argues that justice is a virtue and not simply a means to an end.",
