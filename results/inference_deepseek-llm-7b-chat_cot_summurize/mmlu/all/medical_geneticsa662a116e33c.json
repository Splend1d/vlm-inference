Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are types of DNA-binding proteins.\n\nZinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are both types of DNA-binding proteins. DNA-binding proteins are a class of proteins that interact with DNA to regulate its function. Zinc finger proteins contain domains with a finger-like structure that can bind to specific DNA sequences, while helix-turn-helix proteins contain a helix-turn-helix motif that binds to DNA through this structure. These proteins are involved in various processes such as gene regulation, transcription, and replication.",
