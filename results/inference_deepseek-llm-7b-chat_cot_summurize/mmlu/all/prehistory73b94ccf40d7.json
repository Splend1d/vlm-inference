Natural selection is a process by which organisms with certain advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. This leads to the evolution of species over time.\n\nEarly archaeologists discovered that human culture evolved differently than plants and animals. Human culture, including beliefs, customs, and technology, has evolved over time in a more complex and diverse manner than the evolution of plants and animals. This is because human culture is influenced by a wide range of factors, including social interactions, environmental conditions, and technological advancements, among others.",
