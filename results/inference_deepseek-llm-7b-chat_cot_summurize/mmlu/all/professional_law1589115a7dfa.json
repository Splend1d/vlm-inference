There are too many questionable deficiencies in the suspect's ability to understand what was going on and the confession must be suppressed.\n\nThe suspect had attention deficit disorder, dyslexia, and an IQ of 72, which may have affected his ability to understand the nature of the warnings and waiver of Miranda rights. Additionally, the defendant argued that he was coming down from drugs at the time of the interrogation, which could have further impaired his ability to understand the process. Therefore, the court is likely to suppress the confession based on the suspect's intellectual disability and the questionable deficiencies in his understanding of the process.",
