Which of the following is the best explanation for the effect of low external pH?\n\nA. It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.\nB. It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.\nC. It increases the acid concentration in the mitochondria matrix.\nD. It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. It increases the OH- concentration in the mitochondria matrix.\n\nExplanation: The effect of low external pH on mitochondria is to increase the concentration of OH- in the mitochondria matrix. This leads to the formation of a proton gradient, which is utilized by the mitochondria to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The low external pH does not directly increase the concentration of H+ in the mitochondria matrix, nor does it affect the diffusion of H+ between the intermembrane space and the matrix.",
