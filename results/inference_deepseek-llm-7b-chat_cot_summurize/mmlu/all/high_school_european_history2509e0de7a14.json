Henry IV was a Protestant\nC. prior to 1598, France had been free of religious conflict\nD. prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict\n\nassistant:The passage is an excerpt from the Edict of Nantes, a document issued by King Henry IV of France in 1598. The Edict granted religious freedom to the French Protestant minority, known as Huguenots, in an attempt to maintain peace and unity in the country.\n\nFrom the passage, we can infer that prior to 1598, France was indeed stricken with religious conflict. The Edict's purpose was to establish and proclaim that everything done by one party or the other during the preceding period of troubles should be forgotten and obliterated. This suggests that there had been significant religious turmoil and animosity between different groups in France before 1598, which necessitated the issuance of the Edict in order to restore peace and stability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict.",
