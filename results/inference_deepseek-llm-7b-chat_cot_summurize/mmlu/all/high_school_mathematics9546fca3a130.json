You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: In the equation $|x-4| -10 = 2$, what is the product of all possible values of $x$?\n\nA. -8\nB. 128\nC. -128\nD. 16\n\nassistant:To solve this equation, we first add 10 to both sides to get $|x-4| = 12$.\nThen, we consider two cases: $x-4$ is positive or $x-4$ is negative.\n\nCase 1: $x-4$ is positive. In this case, $|x-4| = x-4$. So we have $x-4=12$, which gives us $x=16$.\n\nCase 2: $x-4$ is negative. In this case, $|x-4| = -(x-4) = 4-x$. So we have $4-x=12$, which gives us $x=-8$.\n\nThe product of all possible values of $x$ is $16\\cdot(-8) = \\boxed{-128}$.\nThe answer is: -128",
