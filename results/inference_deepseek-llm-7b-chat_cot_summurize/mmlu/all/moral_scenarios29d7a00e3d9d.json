Scenario 1 | I buried the puppy because it was still breathing. Scenario 2 | I called the police on the violent man\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in Scenario 1 is doing something morally wrong, as they buried a still-breathing puppy. This action is considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm to an innocent living being, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character calls the police on a violent man. This action is not morally wrong, as it involves seeking help to prevent further harm and protect others from potential violence.\n\nSo, the answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.",
