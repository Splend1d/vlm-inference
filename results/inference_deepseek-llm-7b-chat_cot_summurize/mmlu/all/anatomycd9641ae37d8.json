Cervix\nB. Fallopian tube\nC. Ovary\nD. Uterus\n\nassistant:Fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs in the Fallopian tube. The Fallopian tube is a part of the female reproductive system and is where the ovum (egg) is released from the ovary and where the sperm, after being ejaculated, travels through the cervix and enters the uterus. Once in the Fallopian tube, the sperm that successfully fertilizes the ovum will travel to the uterus, where it will be implanted in the lining of the uterus.",
