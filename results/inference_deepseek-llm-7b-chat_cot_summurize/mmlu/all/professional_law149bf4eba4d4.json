This is because the original easement of necessity was granted by the court, and the existence of the new access route through public improvements does not negate the original easement. Additionally, the fact that another access route has opened up does not necessarily mean that the original easement is no longer needed. Therefore, the court is likely to rule that the easement should continue.",
