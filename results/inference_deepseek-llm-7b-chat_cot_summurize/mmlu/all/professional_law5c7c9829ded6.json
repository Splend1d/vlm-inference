The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\n\nassistant:The students' weakest argument against enforcement of the city ordinance is that the statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad, as it attempts to encompass all forms of singing. This argument is weak because, as mentioned in the scenario, the ordinance expressly exempts from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. Therefore, the ordinance does not apply to the students' chant, as it was not a religious song. \n\nThe other options present stronger arguments against the ordinance:\n\nA. The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This argument is strong because the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the freedom of speech, and the students' chant could be considered speech.\n\nB. The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest. This argument is strong because it questions the legitimacy of the ordinance's purpose, which is to prohibit all forms of singing and chanting from 1:00P.M. to 1:00A.M. on certain streets.\n\nD. The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing. This argument is strong because it challenges the fairness of the ordinance by arguing that it treats religious singing differently than other forms of singing.",
