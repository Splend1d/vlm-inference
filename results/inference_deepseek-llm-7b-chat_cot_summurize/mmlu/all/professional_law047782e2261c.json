No, because the assistant coach's electronic devices did not physically intrude into the team captain's room.\nD. No, because there was publication of the recorded conversations.\n\nassistant:The assistant coach's actions in eavesdropping on the team captain and recording their conversations without their consent would likely constitute an invasion of privacy. While it may be argued that the team captain did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the hotel room, the fact that the assistant coach used electronic devices placed against the wall to listen to and record the conversations still constitutes an invasion of privacy. Therefore, the answer is B. Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.",
