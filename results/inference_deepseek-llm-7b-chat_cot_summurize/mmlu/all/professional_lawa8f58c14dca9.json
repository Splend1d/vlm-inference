In this case, the man is being charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, while the girl is being charged with being an accomplice to the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. However, the girl is only 14 years old, which means she is a minor. Therefore, she cannot be prosecuted for an adult crime. This defense would likely be effective in convincing the jury or judge to find the girl not guilty.",
