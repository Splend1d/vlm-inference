You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: 23Na has an NMR frequency of 198.52 MHz in a 750 MHz NMR spectrometer. What is its magnetogyric ratio?\n\nA. 101.1 x 10^7 T-1 s-1\nB. 26.75 x 10^7 T-1 s-1\nC. 7.081 x 10^7 T-1 s-1\nD. 0.9377 x 10^7 T-1 s-1\n\nassistant:The magnetogyric ratio (\u03b3) of a nucleus is defined as the ratio of the gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3') to the magnetic moment (\u03bc). For 23Na, the gyromagnetic ratio is 26.75 x 10^7 T-1 s-1 (\u03b3' = 26.75 x 10^7 T-1 s-1) and the magnetic moment is 1.86e-28 Am^2. Therefore, the magnetogyric ratio is:\n\n\u03b3 = (\u03b3' / \u03bc) = (26.75 x 10^7 T-1 s-1 / (1.86e-28 Am^2)) = 149,847,542.13\n\nThis is closest to option B. 26.75 x 10^7 T-1 s-1.",
