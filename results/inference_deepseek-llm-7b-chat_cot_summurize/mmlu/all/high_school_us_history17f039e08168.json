The Second Great Awakening was a religious and cultural movement in the United States in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, characterized by a renewed emphasis on religious experience, emotion, and individual conscience. This movement was marked by a strong sense of social justice and a desire to reform society, particularly in the areas of slavery and women's rights. Garrison and The Liberator were part of this broader movement to challenge the status quo and advocate for social change. They used the tools of journalism, rhetoric, and legal argument to argue for the rights of free people of color and to challenge the institution of slavery. The Second Great Awakening provided the cultural and ideological context in which Garrison and The Liberator operated, and their work can be seen as an expression of the values and goals of this movement.",
