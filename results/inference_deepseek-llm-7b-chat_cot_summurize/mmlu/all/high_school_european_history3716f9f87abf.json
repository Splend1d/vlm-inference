Social security and unemployment insurance\n\nassistant:The primary goal of the Chartist movement was Universal suffrage, which is also known as \"household suffrage\" in the excerpt of the letter from Francis Place. This is because the Chartists wanted to extend the right to vote to all men, regardless of their social class or occupation. They believed that every man who was not a working man should be denied the right to vote, and they used harsh language and violent means to try to achieve this goal. The other options listed - Universal male suffrage, Universal health care, and Social security and unemployment insurance - were not the primary goals of the Chartist movement.",
