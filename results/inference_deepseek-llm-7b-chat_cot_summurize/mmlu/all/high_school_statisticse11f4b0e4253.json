A change in measurement units\nB. A change in which variable is called x and which is called y\nC. Adding the same constant to all values of the x-variable\nD. None of the above can affect the r value.\n\nassistant:B. A change in which variable is called x and which is called y.\n\nThe correlation coefficient \"r\" measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The formula for the correlation coefficient is:\n\nr = \u03a3[(x_i - x\u0304)(y_i - \u0233)] / \u03a3(x_i - x\u0304)^2\n\nwhere x\u0304 is the sample mean of x, \u0233 is the sample mean of y, and x_i and y_i are the individual x and y values.\n\nThe value of r is not affected by changes in measurement units, as long as the units of x and y are the same. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nAdding the same constant to all values of the x-variable will not affect the value of r, as long as the constant is the same for both x and y. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nHowever, changing the way the x and y variables are labeled will affect the value of r. This is because the x and y variables are used in the formula for r, and changing their labels will change the way they are used in the formula. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is at least one factor (changing the labels of x and y) that can affect the value of r.",
