Parliament supported industrialization for its own interests. This is because the song is a Luddite song, which was written by the Luddites, a group of workers who were opposed to the use of machines in the textile industry. The Luddites believed that the machines were replacing human labor and causing unemployment. They also feared that the machines would lead to a loss of control over the production process. The song celebrates the destruction of the machines, which shows that the Luddites were opposed to the use of machines in the textile industry. Therefore, it is likely that the song was motivated by the fact that Parliament was promoting industrialization for its own interests, rather than for the benefit of the workers.\n\nA. The movement of many agricultural workers to the new industrial cities increased urbanization. This change is not mentioned in Source 2, The Cropper's Song.\nB.
