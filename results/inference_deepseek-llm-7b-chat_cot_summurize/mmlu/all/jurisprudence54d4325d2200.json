This is an example of a:\n\nA. quasi contract\nB. void contract\nC. voidable contract\nD. secondary party beneficiary contract\n\nassistant:The given situation is an example of a void contract. A void contract is a contract that is considered invalid and unenforceable due to a lack of legal validity. In this case, the agreement between Tom and Jerry to sell heroin is illegal, and therefore, it is considered void.\n\nVoid contracts are contracts that are invalid from the beginning and cannot be enforced by the courts. This can happen when one or both of the parties involved in the contract are not legally capable of entering into a contract, or if the contract involves illegal activities.\n\nIn the example provided, the agreement between Tom and Jerry to sell heroin is illegal, and as a result, it is considered void. It is important to note that void contracts are different from voidable contracts, which can become enforceable if certain conditions are met.\n\nIn conclusion, the given situation is an example of a void contract, where Tom and Jerry agreed to sell heroin, which is an illegal and unenforceable agreement.",
