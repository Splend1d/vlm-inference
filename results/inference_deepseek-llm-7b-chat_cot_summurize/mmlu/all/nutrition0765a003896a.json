Lack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase\n\nassistant:The most likely cause of the student's abdominal cramps and diarrhoea after drinking milk is likely to be a lack of small intestinal lactase. This condition, also known as lactose intolerance, is a common digestive problem that affects the ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. People with lactose intolerance usually experience symptoms such as abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, bloating, and gas after consuming lactose. It is worth noting that the symptoms of lactose intolerance can vary from person to person, and in some cases, individuals may have a mild or unnoticeable reaction to lactose. The other options listed (B. Lack of pancreatic amylase, C. Lack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase, and D. Bacterial and yeast overgrowth in the small intestine) do not seem to be directly related to the symptoms described in the question.",
