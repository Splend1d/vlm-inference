He had been trying to build a new society of labor in common. This suggests that the mining industry was an important part of European industry at the time.\n\nThe question asks for the invention in European industry that grew in importance following the invention of the steam engine. The steam engine was invented in the late 17th century and was widely used in industrial processes by the 18th century. It provided a source of power for machines and helped to mechanize production, leading to increased productivity and the growth of industry.\n\nThe water frame, spinning jenny, and internal combustion engine are not mentioned in the passage, and there is no information provided about their invention or impact on the mining industry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the steam engine",
