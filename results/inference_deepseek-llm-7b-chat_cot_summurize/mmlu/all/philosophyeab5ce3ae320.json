This means we must assume we have knowledge of the basic facts about our rationality, motivation, and social situation as well as our natural abilities and the natural moral quality of our character. This is different from leaving society and remaking social institutions from scratch, and it is also different from forgetting who we are, as the original position is a theoretical construct that allows us to understand the principles of justice. Therefore, the correct answer is B. at any time, by simply following a certain procedure.",
