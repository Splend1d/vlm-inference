You see the star\u2019s blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen.\n\nWhen light from a star passes through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas, the hydrogen atoms absorb some of the light. This absorption creates dark lines in the star's spectrum, which we call absorption lines. So, if you observe the star through the hydrogen cloud, you will see the star's blackbody spectrum with these absorption lines due to hydrogen.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the effect of the hydrogen cloud on the star's spectrum.",
