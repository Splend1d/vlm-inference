The man handed the defendant the $500. After receiving the money, the defendant then punched the man in the stomach and hurriedly left the bar. Under modem statutory law, the defendant will most likely be found guilty of which of the following crimes?\n\nA. Extortion and battery.\nB. Extortion and robbery.\nC. Assault and battery.\nD. Assault and robbery.\n\nassistant:The defendant is most likely guilty of the crime of assault and battery.\n\nExtortion involves obtaining something of value (such as money) from someone by threatening to cause harm. In this case, the defendant threatened to beat the man if he did not pay $500 by a certain date, which can be considered as extortion. After receiving the money, the defendant then punched the man in the stomach, which can be considered as battery.\n\nAssault is the act of attempting to cause harm to someone, while battery is the act of actually causing harm to someone. In this case, the defendant attempted to cause harm to the man by threatening to beat him, and then actually caused harm to him by punching him.\n\nRobbery involves taking something of value from someone by using force or threat of force. In this case, the defendant did not take anything of value from the man, so the crime of robbery does not apply.\n\nTherefore, the defendant is most likely guilty of the crime of assault and battery. The correct answer is C. Assault and battery.",
