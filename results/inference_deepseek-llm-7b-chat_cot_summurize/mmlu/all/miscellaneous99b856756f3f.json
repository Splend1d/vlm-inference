At her current consumption level of the two goods, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good X is 5 and the marginal utility of the last dollar she spent on good Y is 10. To maximize her utility, Carmen should\n\nA. maintain her current consumption level of the two goods\nB. buy fewer units of X and more units of Y\nC. buy fewer units of Y and more units of X\nD. buy fewer units of both X and Y\n\nassistant:To maximize Carmen's utility, she should buy fewer units of both X and Y. This is because the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good X is higher than that of good Y, so she would get more utility per dollar spent on good X. Therefore, she should buy fewer units of X and more units of Y to maintain her current consumption level and maximize her utility.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. buy fewer units of both X and Y.",
