This means that Audi believes that enhancing and preserving freedom is a fundamental duty that should be considered as a prima facie duty.\n\nThe other options are not mentioned by Audi in the context of expanding Ross's list of prima facie duties. Veracity refers to the quality of being truthful or honest, and respectfulness refers to the quality of being respectful or considerate. These are important qualities to possess, but they are not necessarily fundamental duties that should be considered as prima facie duties.",
