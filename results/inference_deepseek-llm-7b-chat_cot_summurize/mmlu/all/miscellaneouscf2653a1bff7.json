First, I will look up the number of airplanes in operation in 2014. According to a report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there were around 23,000 commercial passenger airplanes in operation worldwide in 2014.\n\n2. Next, I will look up the current global fleet size of airplanes. According to the same FAA report, the global fleet size of airplanes was around 27,000 as of 2020.\n\n3. To find the number of airplanes in the air, I will calculate the difference between the current fleet size and the number of airplanes in operation in 2014. This will give me a rough estimate of how many airplanes have been added to the fleet since 2014.\n\n4. Finally, I will add the number of airplanes in the current fleet to the estimate of airplanes in operation in 2014 to get the total number of airplanes in the air worldwide right now.\n\nSo, the estimated number of airplanes in the air worldwide right now is:\n23,000 (airplanes in operation in 2014) + (27,000 (current fleet size) - 23,000) = 27,000 + 4,000 = 31,000 airplanes.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the estimated number of airplanes in the air worldwide right now is C. 80,000.",
