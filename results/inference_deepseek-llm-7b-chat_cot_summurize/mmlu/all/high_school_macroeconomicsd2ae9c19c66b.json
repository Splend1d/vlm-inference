The GDP Deflator is a measure of inflation that uses the prices of a broad basket of goods and services produced in an economy, whereas the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by urban consumers. The GDP Deflator is thought to slightly overestimate the inflation rate, as it includes a larger number of goods and services than the CPI.",
