Babbling\nB. Holophrastic speech\nC. Telegraphic speech\nD. Introductive speech\n\nassistant:B. Holophrastic speech is not one of the stages in the development of language that children of virtually every culture go through. Instead, children typically go through the stages of babbling, telegraphic speech, and introductory speech. Babbling is the first stage of language development, where infants produce random sounds without any specific meaning. Telegraphic speech is the stage where children start to use short, simple sentences, and introductory speech is the stage where children start to use more complete sentences with subject-verb-object structure. Holophrastic speech is a stage in the development of language in some African languages, where children start to use single-word sentences, but this stage is not universal and not all children go through it.",
