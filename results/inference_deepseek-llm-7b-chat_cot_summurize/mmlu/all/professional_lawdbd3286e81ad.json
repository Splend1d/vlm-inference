Upheld, because his conviction would probably have been secured regardless of the admittance of his confession, and the decision was harmless error.\nC. Upheld, because the confession may be admitted to impeach.\nD. Reversed, because a coerced confession is never admissible.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Upheld, because he confessed with full understanding of his right to remain silent, and that his statements could be used against him.\n\nIn this scenario, Mike was arrested on suspicion of larceny and received his Miranda rights. After acknowledging those rights, he was questioned by the Officer. When Mike refused to confess, the Officer threatened him with making his life in the prison \"unpleasant\" if he did not confess. As a result, Mike confessed.\n\nAt the trial, the confession was not used in the prosecution's case-in-chief, but was admitted to impeach Mike's testimony. On appeal, the confession will likely be upheld. This is because, according to the Miranda rights, Mike had the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. However, the fact that Mike acknowledged and understood these rights before confessing indicates that he knowingly and voluntarily made the statement. Therefore, the confession can be admitted to impeach Mike's testimony.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the decision to admit the confession was not harmless error. Answer C is incorrect because although the confession may be admitted to impeach, it does not necessarily mean that it will be upheld. Answer D is incorrect because even though the confession was coerced, it still may be admitted to impeach, as long as the defendant knowingly and voluntarily made the statement.",
