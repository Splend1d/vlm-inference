Female sterilization, also known as tubal ligation, is a permanent form of contraception that can inhibit the production of estrogen. Estrogen is a hormone that plays a role in the menstrual cycle and fertility. By blocking the production of estrogen, female sterilization can prevent pregnancy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the egg is a reproductive cell, not a hormone. Option C is also incorrect because progesterone is a hormone that is produced during pregnancy and the menstrual cycle, not a substance that is inhibited by female sterilization. Option D is incorrect because female sterilization does inhibit the production of estrogen, which can prevent pregnancy.",
