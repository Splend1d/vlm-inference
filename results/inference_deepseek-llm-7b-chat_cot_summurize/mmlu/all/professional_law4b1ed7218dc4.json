The homeowner entered into a contract with the insurance company for fire insurance, which provided coverage for up to $500,000 if the house was destroyed by fire or fire-related explosion. However, the homeowner failed to make the last two quarterly payments, which is a breach of the contract. The insurance company has the right to refuse to pay the homeowner for the loss due to the breach of contract. The homeowner's best argument would be that the insurance company's duty to pay was not expressly conditioned on the homeowner's duty to make the payments, therefore the insurance company should still fulfill their part of the contract.",
