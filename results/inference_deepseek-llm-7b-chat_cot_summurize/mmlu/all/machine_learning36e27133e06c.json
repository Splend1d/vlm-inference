A = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]\n\nA. 0\nB. 1\nC. 2\nD. 3\n\nassistant:To determine the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix. \n\nMatrix A:\n[[1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1]]\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2.\n[[1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1]]\n\nStep 2: Subtract the first row from the second row.\n[[1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 1]]\n\nStep 3: Subtract the first row from the third row.\n[[1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]]\n\nNow we have the row echelon form of the matrix A. The last row represents the coefficients of the rank-1 column vector. Since the last row is the zero vector, the matrix A is singular, and its rank is 0.\n\nAnswer: A. 0",
