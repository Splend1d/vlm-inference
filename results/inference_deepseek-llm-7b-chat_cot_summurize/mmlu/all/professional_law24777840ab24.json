One employee of the department of treasury brought an action claiming a denial of equal protection and due process by taking away his right to a job. It is claimed that the prohibition is necessary to protect the public from potential problems that could arise. Which test of constitutional validity would be likely applied to this regulation?\n\nA.

The rational basis test, because discrimination is generally favored with drug users or even those getting treatment.\nD. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n\nThis regulation is likely to be evaluated under the rational basis test because it aims to protect the safety of the general public by preventing individuals with drug arrests, convictions, and/or current drug treatment from working in certain state facilities. The government has a legitimate interest in ensuring the safety and well-being of its citizens, and the regulation is related to this interest.\n\nStrict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny would not be applicable in this case, as the regulation does not involve a suspect or fundamental right, such as race, gender, or religion. The rational basis test is the most appropriate test for evaluating the constitutionality of this regulation, as it requires the government to demonstrate only that the regulation is related to a legitimate state interest, rather than proving that the regulation is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.",
