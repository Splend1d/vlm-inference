You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: If the correlation between Securities A and B is \u22120.20, and their respective standard deviations are 8% and 18%, what is the standard deviation of a portfolio with one quarter invested in A and three quarters invested in B?\n\nA. 8.70%\nB. 13.20%\nC. 54%\nD. 6.60%\n\nassistant:To find the standard deviation of a portfolio with one quarter invested in A and three quarters invested in B, we can use the following formula:\n\nStandard Deviation = \u221a(w1^2 * \u03c31^2 + w2^2 * \u03c32^2 + 2 * w1 * w2 * Covariance)\n\nwhere w1 and w2 are the weights of Securities A and B in the portfolio, respectively, and \u03c31 and \u03c32 are their respective standard deviations.\n\nGiven the input values:\nw1 = 0.25 (one quarter invested in A)\nw2 = 0.75 (three quarters invested in B)\n\u03c31 = 0.08 (standard deviation of Securities A)\n\u03c32 = 0.18 (standard deviation of Securities B)\nCorrelation = \u22120.20\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula:\n\nStandard Deviation = \u221a((0.25)^2 * (0.08)^2 + (0.75)^2 * (0.18)^2 + 2 * 0.25 * 0.75 * (-0.20))\nStandard Deviation \u2248 8.70%\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 8.70%.",
