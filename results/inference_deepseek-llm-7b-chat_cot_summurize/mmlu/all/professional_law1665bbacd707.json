According to the information provided, the land-sale agreement is not impaired by the existence of the unrecorded mortgage. The land-sale agreement is a separate contract from the mortgage, and the mortgage does not affect the investor's rights under the land-sale agreement. Therefore, the land-sale agreement remains valid and enforceable, and the veterinarian is not in breach of contract.\n\nA is incorrect because the land-sale agreement is not a security device. B is incorrect because the land-sale agreement is not a mortgage, and it does not impair the investor's right of redemption. D is incorrect because the time for the veterinarian to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived, and the existence of the unrecorded mortgage does not affect this.",
