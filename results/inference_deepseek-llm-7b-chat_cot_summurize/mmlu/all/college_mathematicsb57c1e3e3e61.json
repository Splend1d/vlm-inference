Only (II)\nB. Only (IV )\nC. (I) and (IV )\nD. (II) and (III)\n\nassistant:To determine the valid intervals of convergence for a power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of the power series is less than 1, then the power series converges.\n\nLet's analyze each interval:\n\n(I) [\u22121, 3): The limit of the ratio of consecutive terms is:\nlim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n+1/a_n| = |(3 + 2*(-1))^(1/n)/((-1 + 1)^(1/n))| = |(1/2)^(1/n)|\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the value of |(1/2)^(1/n)| approaches 0, which is less than 1. Therefore, the power series converges in the interval (\u22121, 3).\n\n(II) (\u2212\u221e, 0): The limit of the ratio of consecutive terms is:\nlim (n\u2192\u221e) |a_n+1/a_n| = |(0 + 1*(-1))^(1/n)/((-1 + 1)^(1/n))| = |(1/2)^(1/n)|\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the value of |(1/2)^(1/n)| approaches 0, which is less than 1. Therefore, the power series converges in the interval (\u2212\u221e, 0).\n\n(III) [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3]: The power series converges in the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), so both intervals overlap. Therefore, the power series converges in the interval [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3].\n\n(IV) (\u2212\u221e,\u221e): The power series converges in the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u221e).\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
