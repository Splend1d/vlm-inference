Inconsistent\n\nassistant:To construct the truth tables for the given propositions, we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for the propositions. Let's denote:\n\nC - proposition C\nD - proposition D\n\n\u2283 - material implication (if C is true, then D or C must be true)\n\u00b7 - biconditional (if C is true, then D must also be true)\n\u2228 - disjunction (either C or D must be true)\n\nNow, let's construct the truth tables for the given propositions:\n\nC \u2283 (D \u2228 C)\n\n| C | D | C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) |\n|---|---|--------------|\n| T | T | False       |\n| T | F | True        |\n| F | T | True        |\n| F | F | True        |\n\nC \u00b7 ~D\n\n| C | D | C \u00b7 ~D |\n|---|---|--------|\n| T | T | False  |\n| T | F | False  |\n| F | T | True   |\n| F | F | True   |\n\nComparing the truth tables, we can see that:\n\n- For C = T and D = T, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is False, and C \u00b7 ~D is True.\n- For C = T and D = F, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is True, and C \u00b7 ~D is False.\n- For C = F and D = T, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is True, and C \u00b7 ~D is False.\n- For C = F and D = F, C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) is True, and C \u00b7 ~D is True.\n\nBased on the truth tables, the statements C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D are not logically equivalent, as there are cases where one statement is True and the other is False, and vice versa.\n\nFurthermore, there are no cases where both statements are True, so they are not contradictory either. However, there are cases where both statements are False, such as when C = F and D = F. In this case, the statements C \u2283 (D \u2228 C) and C \u00b7 ~D are both False, which means they are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
