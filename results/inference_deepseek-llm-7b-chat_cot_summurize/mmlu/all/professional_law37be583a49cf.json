The party was founded to promote the political power of Latino Americans, and members must pledge to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. However, the party has recently expelled all non-Latino members and now only allows Latino Americans to join. This decision was made because the party believes that only Latinos can be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the party's nominees.\n\nIn this case, the party is proposing to choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. The party will put its slate for U.S. representatives, governor, and U.S. senator before party members for a mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the election. However, some non-Latino citizens in the relevant Congressional District are trying to stop the party from conducting the mail ballot primary. They argue that the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime. The Fifteenth Amendment granted African Americans the right to vote. Both amendments were important in promoting the political power of marginalized groups.\n\nIt is not clear from the information provided which amendment the non-Latino citizens are arguing would proscribe the primary. However, if the primary were to be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment, the federal court would most likely grant relief to the non-Latino citizens. This is because the Thirteenth Amendment prohibits involuntary servitude, which could be interpreted to include being required to vote for a particular candidate.\n\nIf the primary were to be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment, the federal court would most likely grant relief for a different reason. The Fifteenth Amendment grants the right to vote to all citizens, regardless of race. The party's requirement that members pledge to vote only for the party's nominees could be seen as a restriction on the right to vote, which would also be prohibited by the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nIf the federal court were to deny relief, it would most likely do so because the party's primary would be seen as a private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution. However, this argument would be based on the assumption that the party's primary is not interfering with the rights of others, which is not clear from the information provided.\n\nOverall, the most likely outcome would be that the federal court grants relief to the non-Latino citizens, either because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment or the Fifteenth Amendment.",
