Quasi-experimental\nB. Longitudinal\nC. Correlational\nD. Cross-sequential\n\nassistant:The researcher who is interested in the differences between two or more groups of people is most likely to use the approach called \"Correlational.\"\n\nA correlational study is a research design that examines the relationship between two or more variables. In this case, the variables would be the group of people being compared. The goal of a correlational study is to determine whether there is a relationship between the variables and, if so, to determine the nature of that relationship.\n\nIn a correlational study, the researcher would not manipulate any of the variables, but would simply observe and record the relationships between them. For example, a researcher might compare the reading abilities of students in different schools and record the relationship between these abilities and other variables such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status.\n\nThe other options are not the most appropriate approaches for comparing differences between groups of people.\n\nA quasi-experimental approach would involve some form of manipulation of one or more variables, whereas the researcher in this example is only interested in observing relationships between the variables.\n\nA longitudinal approach involves following a group of participants over time and observing changes in the variables of interest. This approach is not appropriate for a researcher interested in comparing differences between two or more groups of people.\n\nA cross-sequential approach involves following a group of participants at different times and observing changes in the variables of interest. This approach is not appropriate for a researcher interested in comparing differences between two or more groups of people.",
