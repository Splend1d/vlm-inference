The amino acids are still added to the growing protein chain, but the symptoms of sickle cell anemia result. This is an example of a\n\nA. frameshift mutation.\nB. missense mutation.\nC. nonsense mutation.\nD. thymine dimer mutation.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Missense mutation.\n\nA missense mutation occurs when a single nucleotide (either a base pair in DNA or a protein building block called an amino acid) is substituted for another nucleotide in the DNA sequence. This substitution can lead to changes in the encoded amino acid, which can result in a change in the structure or function of the resulting protein. In sickle cell anemia, the substitution of an incorrect nucleotide into the DNA sequence for a particular gene leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin molecules with abnormal shapes, which can cause the symptoms of this disease.\n\nA frameshift mutation occurs when there is a change in the number of nucleotides in the DNA sequence, which can result in the addition or removal of entire sections of the gene. This can lead to the production of proteins with different structures or functions than the normal protein.\n\nA nonsense mutation occurs when there is a substitution of a nucleotide that results in the premature termination of the protein-coding sequence. This can lead to the production of a shortened or non-functional protein.\n\nA thymine dimer mutation occurs when there is a reaction between thymine molecules, resulting in the formation of a double-stranded structure called a dimer. This can disrupt the normal DNA sequence and lead to changes in the encoded protein.",
