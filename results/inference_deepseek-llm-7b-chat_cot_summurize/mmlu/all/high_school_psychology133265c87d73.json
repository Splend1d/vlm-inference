What is this process called?\n\nA. proactive interference\nB. long-term potentiation\nC. state-dependent memory\nD. semantic memory\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. long-term potentiation.\n\nLong-term potentiation (LTP) is a process by which the connections between brain neurons are strengthened, leading to the storage of memories. When a neuron fires, it sends a signal to neighboring neurons through synapses. LTP occurs when the connection between these neurons is strengthened, allowing for faster and more efficient communication. This process is essential for learning and memory formation in the brain.",
