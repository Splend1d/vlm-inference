The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists. The officer's actions were justified by the situation, and the subsequent search of the car was also reasonable. The driver's behavior in blasting rap music and the presence of a handgun raised concerns for the officer's safety and that of the other motorists, and the officer's actions were necessary to address these concerns. The drugs found in the car were discovered as a result of the lawful actions taken by the officer, and the driver's motion to suppress will likely be denied.",
