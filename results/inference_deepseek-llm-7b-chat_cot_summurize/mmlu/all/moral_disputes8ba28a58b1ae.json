These terms are used to describe whether an action is morally good or morally bad, or whether it is morally right or morally wrong. This evaluation is based on a set of moral principles or values that guide individuals in making judgments about what is right or wrong.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Persons: While individuals may perform actions that are right or wrong, the terms themselves are not primarily used to evaluate persons. Instead, they are used to evaluate the actions that individuals perform.\n\nC. Consequences: While the consequences of actions can be morally good or bad, the terms \"right\" and \"wrong\" themselves do not evaluate consequences. They evaluate the actions that produce those consequences.\n\nD. Concrete objects: The terms \"right\" and \"wrong\" are not used to evaluate concrete objects. Instead, they are used to evaluate actions that are performed with or involve those objects.",
