Flight: This word can be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships. The letter \"f\" usually makes the /f/ sound, and the letter \"l\" usually makes the /l/ sound. The letters \"i\" and \"t\" make the /i/ and /t/ sounds respectively.\n\nB. Said: This word can also be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships. The letter \"s\" makes the /s/ sound, and the letter \"a\" makes the /\u00e6/ sound. The letter \"e\" makes the /e/ sound.\n\nC. Things: This word can be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships. The letters \"t\", \"h\", \"i\", \"n\", \"g\", and \"s\" make the /t/, /h/, /\u026a/, /n/, /g/, and /s/ sounds respectively.\n\nD. Lamp: This word can be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships. The letters \"l\", \"a\", \"m\", and \"p\" make the /l/, /\u00e6/, /\u00e6/, and /p/ sounds respectively.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, none of the words can be considered as the one that cannot be decoded through knowledge of letter-sound relationships.",
