For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nUnder the doctrine of lapse, a will is deemed to have failed or lapsed if the testator dies before the devise becomes effective. Since the woman sold her farm and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, her will failed to dispose of the farm, and therefore, the residue of her estate lapses back to the residuary legatees, which in this case are her niece and her nephew.\n\nThe doctrine of ademption and equitable estoppel do not apply in this situation. Ademption occurs when a devise is insufficient to discharge the devisees' burden, and equitable estoppel occurs when one party is prevented from asserting a claim due to the actions of another party. Neither of these doctrines is applicable in this case, as the testator's will did not dispose of the farm, and there is no evidence of either party being prevented from asserting a claim.",
