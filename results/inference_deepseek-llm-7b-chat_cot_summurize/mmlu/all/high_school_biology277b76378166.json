Changes in the environment cause rapid changes in different human populations.\nC. Shuffling of alleles is responsible for the greatest variation in humans.\nD. Mutations are responsible for the greatest changes in different human populations.\n\nassistant:The main source of variation in humans is genetic drift. Genetic drift is the random changes in gene frequency within a population over time. It is caused by chance events, such as the decreased frequency of certain alleles due to random sampling.\n\nOther factors such as natural selection, mutation, and recombination also contribute to genetic variation, but genetic drift is the primary source of genetic variation in humans. Therefore, the correct answer is A. The main source of variation in humans is genetic drift.",
