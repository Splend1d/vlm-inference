Citing the non-assignment provision, the buyer claimed that it was no longer bound by the contract. Toasters manufactured by the competitor were of equal quality to toasters manufactured by the seller. Is the buyer bound by the contract?\n\nA. No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.\nB. No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.\nC. Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters.\nD. Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.\n",

Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.\n\nassistant:The buyer is not bound by the contract.\n\nThe non-assignment provision in the contract clearly states that any violation of this provision voids the contract. In this case, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor, which is a clear violation of the non-assignment provision. Therefore, the buyer is not bound by the contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the non-assignment provision does not pertain to the delegation of duties, but rather to the assignment of the contract itself.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the seller's assignment of the contract to the competitor does not void the contract.\n\nOption C is incorrect because even though the seller breached the contract, the buyer is not bound by the contract due to the violation of the non-assignment provision.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the non-assignment provision is enforceable and the buyer is not bound by the contract due to the violation of this provision.",
