(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller / Engle-Granger approach does have some disadvantages. First, it can only estimate one cointegrating relationship at a time, which could be a problem if the user has more than one pair of variables that they want to test for cointegration. Second, for small samples, there is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are, which could lead to incorrect conclusions. Third, it is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression, which can be a problem if the researcher wants to make predictions or understand the dynamics of the cointegrating relationship. Finally, this approach forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables, which can be a limitation if the researcher wants to explore different combinations of variables.",
