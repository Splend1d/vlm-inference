They raise money to influence federal, state, and local elections.\n\nPolitical action committees (PACs) are organizations that raise money to support or oppose political candidates. They are required to disclose their donors and expenditures, and their activities are regulated by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). PACs can engage in both issue and candidate advocacy, but they are not allowed to coordinate with political campaigns or make direct contributions to candidates. They can, however, donate to political party committees, which can then distribute the funds to candidates. PACs are active in federal, state, and local elections.",
