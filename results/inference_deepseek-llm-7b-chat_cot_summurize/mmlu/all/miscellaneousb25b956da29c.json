Rock material carried deep below Earth's surface results in material melting and rising to the surface.\n\nThis statement best explains why volcanoes tend to form along subduction zones. Subduction zones occur when one tectonic plate slides under another, carrying the overlying rock with it. This process causes the overlying rock to be heated and melted, forming magma that rises to the surface and eventually erupts as a volcano. The other options do not accurately describe the formation of volcanoes at subduction zones.",
