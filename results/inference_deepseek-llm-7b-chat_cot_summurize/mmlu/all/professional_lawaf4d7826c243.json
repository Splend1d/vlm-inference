The consent became voluntary as a matter of law when the driver failed to produce a driver's license.\n\nassistant:A. The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.\n\nIn this case, the court is most likely to decide that the driver's consent was voluntarily given and not the result of coercion or duress. The officer did not engage in any duplicitous or coercive conduct, and the driver voluntarily agreed to the search of the vehicle. Although the officer did not advise the driver of their right to refuse consent, this omission does not necessarily make the consent involuntary. The driver was still capable of making a decision and voluntarily agreeing to the search.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. The court would not consider the driver's failure to produce a driver's license as a form of implied duress.\n\nC. The court would not consider the lack of advisement of the right to refuse as a basis for claiming involuntariness.\n\nD. The court would not consider the failure to produce a driver's license as a factor that made the consent voluntary.",
