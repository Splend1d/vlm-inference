However, Donny missed Sally. Sally saw the knife just as it whizzed by her head, missing it by about one inch. As a result, Sally was very scared. Sally sued Donny for assault and battery.

Donny will be liable for assault and for battery.\nD. Donny will not be liable for either assault or battery because this is only a criminal matter.\n\nassistant:Sally sued Donny for assault and battery, which means that she is claiming that Donny intentionally inflicted harm on her. To be liable for assault, a person must have intended to cause fear in another person. In this case, Donny intended to injure Sally severely, so he could be liable for assault. To be liable for battery, a person must have intentionally and directly caused physical harm to another person. In this case, Donny missed Sally, so he did not directly cause physical harm to her, but he intended to do so. Therefore, Donny could be liable for battery as well.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Donny will be liable for assault and for battery.",
