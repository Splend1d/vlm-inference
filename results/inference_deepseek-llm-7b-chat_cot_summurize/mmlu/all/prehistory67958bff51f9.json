Cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone indicate that hominids were able to use stone tools for food processing.\n\nB. The anatomy of Australopithecus africanus hands and analogies with studies of living non-human primates that demonstrate tool use suggest that hominids had the physical ability to make and use stone tools.\n\nC. Simple stone cores, anvil stones, and flakes found at the Lomekwi 3 site in West Turkana, Kenya, provide direct evidence of stone tool technology that dates back to at least 3.3 million years ago.\n\nThese three pieces of evidence collectively support the argument that hominids were making and using stone tools by at least 3.3 million years ago.",
