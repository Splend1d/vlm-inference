Yes, because the neighbor conveyed the home to the daughter by gift rather than by sale.\nD. Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nassistant:D. Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nThe man and the neighbor had an enforceable agreement not to place detached storage sheds in their respective yards. When the neighbor gave his home to his daughter, the daughter became a successor to the neighbor's interest in the property. As a successor, the daughter is bound by the restrictive covenant in the recorded agreement. Therefore, the man has the right to enjoin the neighbor's daughter from placing a detached storage shed in her yard.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the fact that several other homeowners in the subdivision have storage sheds in their yards does not render the man's agreement with his neighbor unenforceable. Additionally, horizontal privity is not a relevant factor in determining whether the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the fact that the neighbor conveyed the property by gift rather than by sale does not affect the enforceability of the restrictive covenant.",
