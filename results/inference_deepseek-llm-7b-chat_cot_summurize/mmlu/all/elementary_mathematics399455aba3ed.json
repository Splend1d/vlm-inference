Which measurement is closest to the circumference of a dime?\n\nA. 1.33 cm\nB. 1.70 cm\nC. 2.67 cm\nD. 5.34 cm\n\nassistant:To find the circumference of a circle, we need to use the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference, \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the dime is 0.85 cm. So, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2 \u00d7 3.14159 \u00d7 0.85\nC \u2248 5.34 cm\n\nSo, the closest answer to the measurement of the circumference of the dime is D. 5.34 cm.",
