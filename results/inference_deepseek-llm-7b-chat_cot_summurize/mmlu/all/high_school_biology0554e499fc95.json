He developed the theory of natural selection, which explained how species change over time through the process of adaptation to their environments. This idea was supported by a wealth of evidence from his observations of species on various islands, as well as his extensive fieldwork. His groundbreaking work in the field of biology, which included the publication of \"On the Origin of Species,\" forever changed our understanding of the history of life on Earth.",
