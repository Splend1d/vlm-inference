I and III.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a measure of a country's economic output or production, which includes both the production of goods and services and the stability of the economy. GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all goods and services produced within a country during a specific time period, such as a year. This includes both goods and services produced by businesses, households, and the government. GDP does not take into account income distribution or the well-being of individuals, but it is a commonly used indicator of a country's economic health and development. Therefore, GDP can be considered as a measure of both production and stability.",
