Which of the following is NOT a good method to restrict his caloric intake?\n\nA. Study at a health smoothie store instead of a coffee shop.\nB. Reward himself with a savory meal every Saturday for meeting his calorie goals.\nC. Snap himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack.\nD. Hide snack food out of sight within his house.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze each option and determine which one is not a good method to restrict caloric intake.\n\nA. Study at a health smoothie store instead of a coffee shop.\nThis option is a good method because it encourages the wrestler to consume healthier foods, such as smoothies, instead of high-calorie drinks from a coffee shop.\n\nB. Reward himself with a savory meal every Saturday for meeting his calorie goals.\nThis option is a good method because it encourages the wrestler to maintain a balanced diet and provides a positive reinforcement for meeting his calorie goals.\n\nC. Snap himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack.\nThis option is not a good method because it involves physical pain and could potentially lead to unhealthy habits or feelings of guilt when snacking.\n\nD. Hide snack food out of sight within his house.\nThis option is a good method because it discourages the wrestler from consuming unhealthy snacks by removing them from sight.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Snap himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack.",
