This is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character turns up the temperature in their home because their wife tells them she is hot. This is not clearly morally wrong either, as it is reasonable to adjust the temperature in one's home to accommodate another person's comfort.",
