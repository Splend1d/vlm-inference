Analytical School\nB. Natural Law School\nC. Historical School\nD. Sociological School\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Analytical School.\n\nThe Analytical School of Jurisprudence holds that customary law becomes part of the legal system when it receives the stamp of judicial recognition. This means that customary law is not automatically incorporated into the legal system, but rather, it becomes part of the legal system when a court recognizes it as law. This recognition can occur through judicial interpretation, legislation, or other legal processes.\n\nThe Natural Law School, which is option B, holds that law is based on natural principles and that customary law is part of the natural law. However, this does not address the question of when customary law becomes law.\n\nOption C, the Historical School, focuses on the historical development of law and does not address the question of when customary law becomes law.\n\nOption D, the Sociological School, examines the social context in which law is created and does not address the question of when customary law becomes law.",
