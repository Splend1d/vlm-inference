Secondary rules are the rules of interpretation of international law, including the law of international responsibility\nB. Secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules, ie of the international obligations of the States\nC. Secondary rules are the rules that govern exclusively the concept of attribution in the law of international responsibility\nD. Secondary rules are the rules that govern exclusively the law of countermeasures\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Secondary rules are the rules of interpretation of international law, including the law of international responsibility.\n\nSecondary rules are not directly related to the legal consequences of a breach of primary rules or to the concept of attribution. They are also not exclusive to the law of countermeasures. Instead, they refer to the rules of interpretation of international law, including the law of international responsibility, which determine the correct meaning of international legal provisions when there is a conflict or ambiguity in their wording. This includes the application of general principles of law, such as the principle of custom, the principle of treaty law, and the principle of the object and purpose of the treaty.",
