We know that the question is asking about the percentage of people in the world who have some access to electricity as of 2017.\n\n2. To find the answer, we will need to find the percentage of people who have access to electricity in 2017.\n\n3. To find this percentage, we need to look up the data on the number of people in the world and the number of people with access to electricity in 2017.\n\n4. Let's assume the number of people in the world is 7 billion.\n\n5. Let's assume the number of people with access to electricity is 5 billion.\n\n6. Now we can calculate the percentage of people with access to electricity: (5 billion / 7 billion) x 100 = 71.4%\n\n7. Since the options provided do not match the calculated percentage, let's look at the options again.\n\n8. Option A. 60%: This option is lower than the calculated percentage.\n\n9. Option B. 70%: This option is higher than the calculated percentage.\n\n10. Option C. 80%: This option is higher than the calculated percentage.\n\n11. Option D. 90%: This option is higher than the calculated percentage.\n\n12. Based on the calculations and the options provided, the answer is A. 60%.",
