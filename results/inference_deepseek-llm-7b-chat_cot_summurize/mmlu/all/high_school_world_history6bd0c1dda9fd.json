The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers. This is because the text mentions that foreign investment from capitalist countries must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. This suggests that the foreign investors would not have full control over the investment and the national plan, implying that there would be no formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers.",
