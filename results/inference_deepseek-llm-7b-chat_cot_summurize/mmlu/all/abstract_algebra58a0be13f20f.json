Statement 2 | If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H. This statement is true. If a is in H, then aH = H, and since H is a subgroup of G, aH is also a subgroup of G. Conversely, if aH is a subgroup of G, then a = ahk, where h is in H and k is in G. Since a is in G, we have a = ahk = h(ahk) = hk, which implies that a is in H.\n\nStatement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H. This statement is false. It is true that aH = bH if and only if ab is in H if and only if ab is in the intersection of H and the set of elements that can be written as hk for some h in G and k in G. However, it is not true that ab is in H.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
