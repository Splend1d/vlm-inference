The sum of the lengths of the two equal sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. 2,2,3: The sum of the lengths of the two equal sides is 4, which is less than the length of the third side, 3. Therefore, this cannot be the sides of an isosceles triangle.\n\nB. 2,2,4: The sum of the lengths of the two equal sides is 4, which is greater than or equal to the length of the third side. This could be the sides of an isosceles triangle.\n\nC. 4,12,12: The sum of the lengths of the two equal sides is 24, which is greater than or equal to the length of the third side. This could be the sides of an isosceles triangle.\n\nD. 5,5,5: The sum of the lengths of the two equal sides is 10, which is greater than or equal to the length of the third side. This could be the sides of an isosceles triangle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 2,2,3 could NOT be the sides of an isosceles triangle.",
