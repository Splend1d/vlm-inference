We can conclude that\n\nA. demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is falling.\nB. demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is rising.\nC. demand for beef is price inelastic and consumer spending on beef is falling.\nD. demand for beef is price inelastic and consumer spending on beef is rising.\n\nassistant:A 10 percent increase in price and a 20 percent decrease in quantity demanded would result in a 140 percent change in the price elasticity of demand (10 percent + 20 percent). This is a very high change, indicating that the demand for beef is highly sensitive to price changes. Therefore, we can conclude that the demand for beef is price elastic.\n\nSince the quantity demanded has fallen, we can infer that consumer spending on beef is also falling. So, option A is the correct answer.",
