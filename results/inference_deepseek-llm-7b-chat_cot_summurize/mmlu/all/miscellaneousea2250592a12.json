Fandangos are a type of dance that originated in Spain and are often associated with flamenco music and dance. They have been performed in Spain for centuries and have also spread to other parts of the world, particularly Latin America and the Caribbean. The name \"fandango\" is believed to be derived from the Spanish verb \"fandear,\" which means \"to stamp\" or \"to dance with stamping movements.\" Fandangos are typically performed to lively music and involve intricate footwork, hand movements, and expressive body language.",
