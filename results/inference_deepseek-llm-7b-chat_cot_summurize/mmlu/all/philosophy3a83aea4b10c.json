This is because a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments may be unable to make rational decisions or understand the consequences of their actions.\n\nHare's argument is based on the idea that making moral judgments is essential for rational decision-making. If someone refuses to make any positive moral judgments, they may not be able to distinguish between right and wrong, or to evaluate the potential consequences of their actions. This lack of judgment can lead to irrational decisions and actions.",
