Three forces act on the car: a friction force between the tires and the road, the normal force from the road, and the weight of the car. Which provides the centripetal force which keeps the car in circular motion?\n\nA. the friction force alone\nB. the normal force alone\nC. the weight alone\nD. a combination of the normal force and the friction force\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. a combination of the normal force and the friction force.\n\nCentripetal force is the force that keeps an object in circular motion. It is equal to the product of the mass of the object and its velocity divided by the radius of the circle. In the case of a car rounding a banked curve, the centripetal force is provided by a combination of the normal force and the friction force acting on the tires.\n\nThe normal force is the force exerted by the road on the car in the direction perpendicular to the road surface. It acts against gravity and helps to keep the car in a stable position.\n\nThe friction force between the tires and the road is the force that prevents the car from sliding or skidding along the road. It acts in the direction opposite to the movement of the tires.\n\nWhen the car is in motion along a banked curve, the normal force and the friction force act in the same direction as the centripetal force, which is directed towards the center of the curve. Therefore, they all contribute to providing the centripetal force that keeps the car in circular motion.",
