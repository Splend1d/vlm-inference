Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.

Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\nD. Hematoma of the left thigh\n\nassistant:The most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (C). The patient had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which may have caused swelling or pressure on the nerve as it passes through the inguinal canal. The other options are less likely: cerebral infarction (A) is less likely because the patient did not report any neurological symptoms during the hospitalization, and hematoma of the left thigh (D) has already resolved. IVC filter placement (B) is also less likely because the patient did not report this complication in the hospital.",
