(Assume complete dissociation.)\n\nA. 0.050 M AlCl3\nB. 0.100 M NaCl\nC. 0.050 M CaCl2\nD. 0.100 M HCl\n\nassistant:The ionic strength of a solution can be determined by measuring the concentration of the positive and negative ions present in the solution. The ionic strength is defined as the concentration of the positively charged ions (aq+) multiplied by the concentration of the negatively charged ions (aq-).\n\nThe given solutions are:\n\nA. 0.050 M AlCl3 - Al3+ and Cl- ions\nB. 0.100 M NaCl - Na+ and Cl- ions\nC. 0.050 M CaCl2 - Ca2+ and Cl- ions\nD. 0.100 M HCl - H+ and Cl- ions\n\nTo compare the ionic strength of these solutions, we need to find the concentration of the positively charged ions (aq+) and the concentration of the negatively charged ions (aq-).\n\nFor solution A, the concentration of the positively charged ions (Al3+) is 0.050 M and the concentration of the negatively charged ions (Cl-) is also 0.050 M. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution A is 0.050 M x 0.050 M = 0.0025 M\u00b2.\n\nFor solution B, the concentration of the positively charged ions (Na+) is 0.100 M and the concentration of the negatively charged ions (Cl-) is also 0.100 M. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution B is 0.100 M x 0.100 M = 0.0100 M\u00b2.\n\nFor solution C, the concentration of the positively charged ions (Ca2+) is 0.050 M and the concentration of the negatively charged ions (Cl-) is also 0.050 M. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution C is 0.050 M x 0.050 M = 0.0025 M\u00b2.\n\nFor solution D, the concentration of the positively charged ions (H+) is 0.100 M and the concentration of the negatively charged ions (Cl-) is also 0.100 M. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution D is 0.100 M x 0.100 M = 0.0100 M\u00b2.\n\nComparing the ionic strengths of the solutions, we can see that solution B has the highest ionic strength.",
