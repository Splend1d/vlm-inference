I. The mean of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the mean of the population. II. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the standard deviation of x- divided by the square root of the sample size. III. If the sample size is large, the shape of the sampling distribution of x- is approximately normal.\n\nA. I only\nB. I & II only\nC. II only\nD. III only\n\nassistant:The central limit theorem is a principle in probability theory and statistics that describes the distribution of the average of many trials. Among the given options, only option III accurately describes the central limit theorem.\n\nOption III states that if the sample size is large, the shape of the sampling distribution of x- is approximately normal. This means that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that the average of many trials will approach the true average of the population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. III only.",
