It is a tool that is commonly used to depict the age-sex structure of a population. \n\nOption A, \"future social spending needs of the population,\" is not displayed by a population pyramid. A population pyramid only provides information about the current distribution of the population based on age and sex. It does not take into account future social spending needs, which would require a different type of analysis.\n\nOption B, \"the impact of 'baby booms' on the population,\" is also not displayed by a population pyramid. While a population pyramid can show changes in the population over time, it does not specifically show the impact of \"baby booms\" or other events on the population.\n\nOption C, \"the impact of wars on the population,\" is also not displayed by a population pyramid. A population pyramid is not able to depict the impact of wars on the population, which would require a different type of analysis.\n\nOption D, \"a quick visual depiction of the country's demographics,\" is true. A population pyramid is a quick and easy way to visualize the demographics of a population. It can show the distribution of the population based on age and sex, and can help to identify trends and patterns in the population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A, \"future social spending needs of the population.\"",
