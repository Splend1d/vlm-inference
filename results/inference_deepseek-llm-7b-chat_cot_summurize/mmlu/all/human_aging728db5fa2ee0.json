Positive ones are stronger\nB. Negative ones are stronger\nC. They never last very long\nD. They are very rare\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Positive ones are stronger.\n\nAccording to research, positive age stereotypes are indeed stronger than negative ones. For example, studies have shown that older adults are generally perceived as being wiser, more experienced, and more stable than younger individuals. On the other hand, negative age stereotypes, such as older adults being seen as technologically illiterate or set in their ways, are generally not as strong as their positive counterparts.\n\nIt is important to note that age stereotypes can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, depending on the specific stereotype in question. Positive age stereotypes can sometimes contribute to age discrimination, as they may lead people to unfairly assume that older individuals have certain abilities or limitations. Negative age stereotypes, on the other hand, can sometimes lead to age discrimination as well, as they may lead people to unfairly stereotype older individuals as being less competent or less valuable than younger individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, age stereotypes can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, and it is important for people to be aware of these stereotypes and how they may impact their interactions with others.",
