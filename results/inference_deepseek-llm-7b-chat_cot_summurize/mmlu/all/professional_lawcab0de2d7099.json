However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son.

With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely\n\nA. relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\nB. relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.\nC. not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\nD. not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\n\nIn this case, the father made a promise to the finance manager as a surety, which means he agreed to pay the balance due if the son defaulted on the payments. However, the main purpose of the agreement between the finance manager and the son was to finance the purchase of the car, not to provide security for the father. Therefore, the court would not relieve the father of liability, as the main purpose exception applies in this situation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the father's promise was not a legal obligation, but rather an agreement made with the finance manager.\nOption B is incorrect because the father's promise was not a surety, but rather an agreement made with the finance manager.\nOption D is incorrect because the father's promise was not a debt of the son, but rather an agreement made with the finance manager.",
