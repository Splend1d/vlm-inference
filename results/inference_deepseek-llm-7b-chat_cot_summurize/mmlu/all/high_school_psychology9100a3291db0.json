To explain the concept of grade equivalent, the school psychologist should explain that it is\n\nA. the average score on that measure obtained by students in a given grade\nB. the average score on that measure obtained by students at a given age\nC. the grade in which a student should be placed in school\nD. utilized to determine accountability among peers\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. The grade equivalent is the average score on a measure of academic achievement obtained by students at a given age. This is used to compare the student's performance to the performance of other students of the same age. It is not used to determine accountability among peers, but rather to provide insight into the student's academic progress compared to their peers.\n\nThe school psychologist should explain that the grade equivalent is calculated by comparing the student's score to the national norm-referenced test scores of students in various age groups. This allows the psychologist to identify the student's strengths and areas for improvement, and to develop a more accurate and individualized educational plan.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The grade equivalent is the average score on a measure of academic achievement obtained by students at a given age.",
