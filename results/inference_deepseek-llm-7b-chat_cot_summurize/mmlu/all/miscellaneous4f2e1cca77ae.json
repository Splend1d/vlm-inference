A chain of coastal volcanic mountains\n\nWhen a continental lithospheric plate collides with an oceanic lithospheric plate, the oceanic plate is denser and will subduct under the continental plate. As the oceanic plate is forced into the mantle, it melts, leading to the formation of a chain of volcanic mountains along the boundary of the two plates. This process is known as subduction. The other options do not directly result from a collision between these two types of plates.",
