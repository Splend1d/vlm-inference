Air resistance is not negligible. Which of the following statements are true?\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. I & II only\nD. I & III only\n\nassistant:Let's analyze the given statements step-by-step:\n\nI. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is true. When the whiffle ball is at its highest point, it is momentarily not moving downward (with respect to the ground). Therefore, its speed is zero.\n\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is also true. Since the ball is momentarily not moving downward, it has no acceleration in the downward direction.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nThis statement is false. The time it takes for the ball to travel up to the highest point is the same as the time it takes to fall back down. Both events are symmetrical, and the time taken for each is equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is I & II only.",
