Increase weight\nB. Improve sleep quality\nC. Disrupt attention the next day\nD. Increase irritability\n\nassistant:C. Disrupt attention the next day\n\nAlthough all of the mentioned effects can be associated with sleep deprivation, the most prominent effect that a small amount of sleep deprivation seems to have is disrupting attention the next day. This is because sleep plays a crucial role in consolidating memories and cognitive processes, and a lack of sleep can impair the brain's ability to process information and focus attention. Therefore, the next day, a person who has not gotten enough sleep may experience difficulty concentrating, making decisions, and processing information effectively.\n\nWhile it is true that sleep deprivation can also cause weight gain and increase irritability, these effects are not as directly related to the immediate disruption of attention as the one mentioned above. Additionally, while improving sleep quality might help to mitigate the negative effects of sleep deprivation, it does not address the immediate disruption of attention that occurs when a person has not gotten enough sleep.",
