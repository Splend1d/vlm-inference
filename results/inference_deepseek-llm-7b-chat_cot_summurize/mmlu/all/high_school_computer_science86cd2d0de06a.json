Initialize heads_counter and flip_counter to 0.\n2. coin_f1ip is randomly assigned a value of either 0 or 1.\n3. If coin_f1ip is 0, heads_counter is incremented by 1.\n4. Increment the value of flip_counter by 1.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until flip_counter equals 4.\n6. After the loop, check if heads_counter is equal to flip_counter.\n\nLet's go through the steps for the example:\n\n1. heads_counter = 0, flip_counter = 0\n2. coin_f1ip = 1, heads_counter = 1, flip_counter = 1\n3. coin_f1ip = 0, heads_counter = 2, flip_counter = 2\n\nAfter the loop, heads_counter is equal to flip_counter, which is 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. flip_counter = 2.",
