The buyer cannot claim any damages from the city for the cracked sewer line, as the city had acquired a valid easement for the sewer line.\n\nA. The buyer does not prevail because the sewer line was installed before the buyer purchased the property, as this argument is not valid.\nC. The buyer does not prevail if the sewer line was negligently maintained, as negligence is not proven in the case.\nD. The buyer does not prevail because the sewer line does not constitute a public nuisance, as a public nuisance is typically a situation that endangers the public or causes harm to a large number of people.",
