This technique can be useful in situations where there are significant differences between the subgroups in the population, and the auditor suspects that fraud may have occurred in one or more of the subgroups. For example, if the auditor suspects that management has been embezzling funds from the company, they may stratify the population by department or function to focus their substantive tests on the areas where fraud is most likely to occur.",
