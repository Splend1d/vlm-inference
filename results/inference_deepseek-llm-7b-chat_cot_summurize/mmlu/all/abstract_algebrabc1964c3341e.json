Statement 2 | If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\nThis statement is false. A factor group of a non-Abelian group is also non-Abelian. Therefore, the first statement is True.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nThis statement is also false. This statement is the contrapositive of the fundamental theorem of group theory, which states that if H is a normal subgroup of G and K is a normal subgroup of H, then K is a normal subgroup of G. However, this statement is not true in general. For example, if H is a cyclic group of prime order p and G is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 3, then H is a normal subgroup of G, but K (the subgroup generated by the element of order 2) is not a normal subgroup of H. Therefore, the second statement is False.\n\nSo, the correct answers are A. True, False.",
