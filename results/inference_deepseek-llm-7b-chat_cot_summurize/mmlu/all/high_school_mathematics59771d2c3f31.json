If both rolls are multiples of 3:\nThere are 4 multiples of 3 in the first die (3, 6, 9, 12) and 2 multiples of 3 in the second die (3, 6). There are a total of 6 successful outcomes (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), (6,6), (9,3), (9,6), and 8 possible outcomes (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (4,3), (4,6), (6,3), (6,6). The probability of this happening is 6/8 = 3/4.\n\n2. If the product is a multiple of 3 and one of the rolls is a multiple of 3:\nThere are 4 multiples of 3 in the first die (3, 6, 9, 12) and 2 multiples of 3 in the second die (3, 6). There are a total of 12 successful outcomes (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), (6,6), (9,3), (9,6), (3,1), (6,1), (9,1), (3,2), (6,2), (9,2), and 8 possible outcomes (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (4,3), (4,6), (6,3), (6,6). The probability of this happening is 12/8 = 3/2.\n\n3. If the product is a multiple of 3 and the first roll is a multiple of 3:\nThere are 4 multiples of 3 in the first die (3, 6, 9, 12) and 2 multiples of 3 in the second die (3, 6). There are a total of 12 successful outcomes (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), (6,6), (9,3), (9,6), (3,1), (6,1), (9,1), (3,2), (6,2), (9,2), and 8 possible outcomes (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (4,3), (4,6), (6,3), (6,6). The probability of this happening is 12/8 = 3/2.\n\nAdding the probabilities from each case, we get (3/4) + (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two rolls is a multiple of 3 is 3/4.\n\nThe answer is B.",
