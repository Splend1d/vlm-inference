As the information from the two eyes' retinas crosses, it is processed and combined to create a single, coherent image. This process occurs at the optic chiasm, which is a region in the brain where the optic nerve splits into two branches, one for each eye. The optic chiasm is located at the base of the brain, just behind the eyes.",
