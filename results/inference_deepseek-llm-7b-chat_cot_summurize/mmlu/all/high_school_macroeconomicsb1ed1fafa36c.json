Since the supply of DVD players is relatively fixed, this increase in demand will result in a rise in the equilibrium price. However, the change in the equilibrium quantity is ambiguous because it depends on the responsiveness of the firms supplying DVD players to the change in demand. If the firms are price takers, the equilibrium quantity will also increase. If the firms are price setters, the equilibrium quantity may remain the same or even decrease.",
