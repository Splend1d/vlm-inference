Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\nC. legal title remained in Sloan.\nD. equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nassistant:This problem is a legal case question that requires a deep understanding of contract law and the doctrine of equitable conversion. Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\nStep 1: Understand the contract\nThe contract of sale between Beeson and Sloan states that Beeson is to purchase the property from Sloan for $250,000, with a deposit of $12,500 paid upfront and the balance due at closing on December 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the situation\nOn November 24, the city council rezoned the property, changing its use from commercial to single-family residential. As a result, Beeson refused to honor the contract.\n\nStep 3: Apply legal principles\nThe doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer if the buyer is the one who caused the change in the property's use. In this case, Beeson is arguing that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer\nThe correct answer is D. Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain. This is because Beeson was not able to use the property for its intended purpose due to a change in the property's zoning.\n\nTherefore, if judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because equity will relieve him of a bad bargain.",
