During the defendant's case-in-chief, the defendant called several character witnesses to testify as to his good character. As part of the prosecution's rebuttal, the defendant's ex-wife was called to testify that during their marriage the defendant had a violent temper, beat her frequently, and once threatened her with a knife.

In most jurisdictions, character evidence is inadmissible in criminal trials. This is because character evidence is often used to attack a defendant's character rather than to prove the defendant's guilt of the crime charged. The prosecution's use of the defendant's character witnesses during the defendant's case-in-chief is not enough to allow the prosecution to introduce character evidence during its rebuttal. Therefore, the ex-wife's testimony should be ruled inadmissible.",
