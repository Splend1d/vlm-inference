Which of the following substance could be consumed in excess, i.e. well above the recommended daily requirement?\n\n\nA. Vitamin C\nB. Vitamin D\nC. Zinc\nD. Vitamin A\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will search for information on the recommended daily requirement (RDA) for each of the substances mentioned and then identify which one can be consumed in excess.\n\n1. Vitamin C: The RDA for Vitamin C is 75-90 mg/day for adults. Consuming more than this amount is generally safe, but excessive consumption can cause gastrointestinal side effects.\n\n2. Vitamin D: The RDA for Vitamin D is 600-800 IU/day for adults. While it is difficult to consume too much Vitamin D from food sources, excessive supplementation can lead to toxicity.\n\n3. Zinc: The RDA for Zinc is 8-11 mg/day for adults. Consuming more than this amount can lead to gastrointestinal side effects and interfere with absorption of other minerals.\n\n4. Vitamin A: The RDA for Vitamin A is 900-1300 mcg/day for adults. Consuming more than this amount can cause toxicity and potential liver damage.\n\nBased on the information, the substance that can be consumed in excess, i.e. well above the recommended daily requirement, is Vitamin A.",
