In this quotation, Voltaire discusses the importance of tolerance and how it is a fundamental aspect of nature. He also mentions that Christians should be the most tolerant of all people, yet they have been the most intolerant.\n\nFrom the given options, the correct answer is:\n\nB. tolerance was a value of the Enlightenment\n\nThe quotation does not provide enough information to infer that Voltaire was an atheist, that tolerance violated the laws of nature, or that he believed tolerance was uniquely English. The Enlightenment was a period in history characterized by reason, tolerance, and the belief in individual rights. Voltaire was a prominent figure of the Enlightenment, and his writings reflect the values of tolerance and reason that were central to the Enlightenment.",
