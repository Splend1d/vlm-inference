The Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land.\nC. The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico.\nD. The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa.\n\nassistant:The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was a treaty between King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile and King John II of Portugal. The treaty divided the newly discovered territories in the Atlantic Ocean between the two monarchies, with Portugal receiving territories to the west of a demarcation line drawn across the Atlantic, and Castile and Aragon receiving territories to the east.\n\nOption A is not a valid inference because the text does not mention anything about the route to the New World or the ease of traveling east.\n\nOption B is not a valid inference because the text does not mention anything about the crusades against the Mamelukes or the Holy Land.\n\nOption C is not a valid inference because the text does not mention anything about the desire to control the lands of Mexico.\n\nOption D, however, is a valid inference. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed at a time when the Portuguese already knew about a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. By insisting on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line, the King of Portugal was likely trying to ensure that any lands discovered to the east of the line would also fall under Portuguese control, which would give them access to the trade routes and wealth of India.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa.",
