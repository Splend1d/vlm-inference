The ordinance aims to promote traffic safety and aesthetics in the city, and the 10-foot sign goes against these interests. While commercial speech is protected by the First Amendment, it is subject to greater regulation than other forms of protected speech, and the city council has the right to pass ordinances to regulate commercial speech. Therefore, the owner would not prevail in challenging the city ordinance.",
