From the dismantling of small moons by impacts\nB. From fragments of planets ejected by impacts\nC. From dust grains that escape from passing comets\nD. From accretion within the solar nebula at the same time the planets formed\n\nassistant:Planetary rings are made primarily from fragments of icy bodies, such as comets or small moons, that have been broken off and scattered by the force of impacts. Option A is partially correct, as impacts can indeed cause small moons to disintegrate and release their ring material. However, the primary source of ring material is not the dismantling of small moons, but rather the ejection of fragments from larger bodies.\n\nOption B is not the primary source of ring material, as fragments of planets are not typically found in planetary rings. Planets are typically composed of solid rock and metal, whereas rings are made of ice and rock dust.\n\nOption C is also not the primary source of ring material. While dust grains from passing comets may occasionally become incorporated into a planetary ring, they are not the primary source of ring material. Comets themselves are primarily composed of ice and dust, so it is the breaking up of these bodies that releases the ice and rock dust that forms planetary rings.\n\nOption D is not the primary source of ring material either. Planetary rings form from the debris of other bodies, not from accretion within the solar nebula at the same time the planets formed. The formation of planetary rings is a separate process from the formation of planets, and occurs after the planets have already formed.\n\nIn summary, the primary source of ring material is from fragments of icy bodies, such as comets or small moons, that have been broken off and scattered by the force of impacts. These fragments are then incorporated into the ring system, where they remain until they eventually collide with other particles or are absorbed back into the body they originated from.",
