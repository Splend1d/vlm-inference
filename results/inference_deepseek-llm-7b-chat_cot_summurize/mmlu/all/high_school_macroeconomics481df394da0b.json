Budget surpluses and higher discount rates: This option indicates contractionary fiscal policy, which aims to reduce the size of the deficit and decrease the amount of money in the economy. Higher discount rates can help to slow down the economy by making borrowing more expensive. However, the combination of budget surpluses and higher discount rates may not be the best option for the contractionary phase, as it could lead to an over-tightening of the monetary policy.\n\nB. Tax reductions and open market purchases: This option suggests expansionary fiscal policy, which aims to increase the size of the deficit and increase the amount of money in the economy. Tax reductions can increase consumer spending, while open market purchases can increase the money supply. This combination would be more suitable for the contractionary phase, as it would help to stimulate the economy and prevent a recession.\n\nC. Budget surpluses and lower discount rates: This option also suggests expansionary fiscal policy, which would be less appropriate for the contractionary phase.\n\nD. Increases in government spending and higher discount rates: This option suggests contractionary fiscal policy, which would be less appropriate for the contractionary phase.\n\nBased on the analysis of the options, the most appropriate answer is B. Tax reductions and open market purchases.",
