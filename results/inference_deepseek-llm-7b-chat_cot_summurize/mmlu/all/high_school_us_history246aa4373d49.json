Northern Republicans in the 1860s\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze the information provided by Frederick Douglass and identify the group most likely to support his perspective.\n\nFrederick Douglass was an African American abolitionist who escaped from slavery in the 1850s. In the passage provided, he criticizes the organization of the slaveholders and the various institutions that supported slavery, including the State governments, the church organizations, and the Federal Government.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Southern Democrats in the 1880s: This group would have supported the status quo of slavery, as they were the party that maintained slavery in the South. They would likely not support the perspective of Frederick Douglass, who was an advocate for the abolition of slavery.\n\nB. Western ranchers in the 1850s: This group was not specifically mentioned in the passage, so we cannot determine their position on slavery or whether they would support Frederick Douglass's perspective.\n\nC. Southern farmers in the 1830s: This group was active during the height of the slavery era. While some might have supported abolition, most likely would have supported the slaveholders' advantage and would not support Frederick Douglass's perspective.\n\nD. Northern Republicans in the 1860s: This group was advocating for the abolition of slavery, which aligns with Frederick Douglass's perspective. They would have been the most likely to support his perspective.\n\nBased on this analysis, the group most likely to support the perspective of Frederick Douglass is Northern Republicans in the 1860s. Therefore, the answer is D.",
