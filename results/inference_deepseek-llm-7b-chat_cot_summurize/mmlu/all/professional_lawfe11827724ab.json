When he returned to pick up his car later in the day, the mechanic told him the charge was $1 The owner objected and said the charge was excessively high. The mechanic indicated that the amount was reasonable and showed the owner a price listing substantiating the charge. As the two men were arguing, the mechanic excused himself to answer the telephone in the rear of his shop. While the mechanic was on the phone, the owner got into his car and drove off without paying the servicing charges. If the owner is subsequently charged with larceny, he should be found\n\nA. not guilty, because the car was his own property.\nB. not guilty, if the jury finds the servicing charge to be excessively high.\nC. guilty, if the jurisdiction has a statute making theft of services a crime.\nD. guilty, because he took the car without the mechanic's consent.\n\nassistant:The owner should be found (C) guilty, if the jurisdiction has a statute making theft of services a crime. The owner took his car to the mechanic for a service, and when the mechanic charged him a reasonable amount, the owner decided to drive off without paying the bill. This is considered theft of services, and the owner could be charged with a crime if there is a specific statute in the jurisdiction that makes theft of services a criminal offense.\n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\nA. Not guilty, because the car was his own property: This argument is not relevant to the crime of theft of services. The car is the property of the mechanic, not the owner, until the owner pays for the service.\n\nB. Not guilty, if the jury finds the servicing charge to be excessively high: This option is also not applicable, as the jury's decision on whether the charge is excessive is not relevant to the crime of theft of services. The owner still has a moral and legal obligation to pay for the service rendered to his car.\n\nD. Guilty, because he took the car without the mechanic's consent: While the owner did take the car without the mechanic's consent, this is not a valid reason to charge him with theft of services. The mechanic had no legal right to the car until the owner paid for the service.",
