One way to stimulate the economy is to decrease taxes for consumers, which can increase their purchasing power and encourage them to spend more. Additionally, increasing government spending on goods and services can also boost economic activity.\n\nWhen consumers have more money in their pockets, they are more likely to spend it, which can lead to an increase in real GDP. The increase in consumer spending can also lead to an increase in the price level, as suppliers raise their prices to take advantage of the increased demand. However, the decrease in taxes can offset some of this increase in the price level, leading to a rise in real GDP without a significant increase in the price level.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that decreasing taxes and increasing government spending would lead to a decrease in real GDP, which is counterintuitive during a recession. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that decreasing taxes and increasing government spending would lead to an increase in the price level without an increase in real GDP, which is not likely to be effective in stimulating the economy. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that decreasing taxes and increasing government spending would lead to a decrease in both real GDP and the price level, which is not likely to be effective in stimulating the economy during a recession.",
