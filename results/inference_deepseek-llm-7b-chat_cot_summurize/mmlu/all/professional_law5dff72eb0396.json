At the client consultation, the attorney's secretary took notes. With the permission bf the husband, the attorney's law clerk also sat in on the consultation to see how the attorney conducted these meetings. Shortly after this initial consultation with the attorney, the secretary quit. During the divorce trial, the wife's attorney seeks to call the secretary to testify about what the husband told the attorney during the initial client consultation. Upon objection, the secretary's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible, because her presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney-client privilege.\nB. admissible, because the law clerk's presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney- client privilege.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege disqualifies the secretary from testifying to such confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nassistant:C. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege disqualifies the secretary from testifying to such confidential communications.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege is a rule that prevents the disclosure of confidential communications between an attorney and their client. In this case, the husband gave confidential information to the attorney during the consultation, and the secretary was present during the meeting with the husband's permission. Therefore, the secretary is not allowed to testify about what was discussed during that meeting, as it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The presence of the law clerk does not destroy the attorney-client privilege. The law clerk was only observing the meeting to learn how to conduct similar meetings in the future, not to participate in the consultation.\n\nB. The presence of the law clerk does not destroy the attorney-client privilege. The law clerk was only observing the meeting to learn how to conduct similar meetings in the future, not to participate in the consultation.\n\nD. The fact that the secretary was present during the meeting is not the issue. The issue is that the information discussed during the meeting is confidential and falls under the attorney-client privilege.",
