False, True\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. True, False.\n\nIn the first statement, it is not clear what \"homomorphism\" means, and the sentence structure is unclear. So, we cannot determine the truth of this statement.\n\nIn the second statement, there is a clear definition of a homomorphism in the context of group theory. The statement implies that there is a homomorphism of a group of 6 elements into a group of 12 elements. This statement is true in the context of group theory, as it is possible for a group of 6 elements to be a subgroup of a group of 12 elements, and thus there can be a homomorphism from the 6-element group to the 12-element group.",
