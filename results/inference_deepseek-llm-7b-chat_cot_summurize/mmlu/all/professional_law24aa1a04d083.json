Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.\n\nThe judge's failure to issue a written opinion or memorandum of decision after the bench trial raises concerns about the completeness and clarity of the record on appeal. Appellate courts generally require written findings of fact in order to ensure that the record is complete and to provide clarity for the parties and the appellate court. Without a written opinion or memorandum of decision, it is difficult to determine the reasoning and basis for the judge's findings, which may lead to an increased likelihood of reversal on appeal.",
