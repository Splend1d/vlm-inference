The gambler further explained that he had read that the odds of his team winning the football championship next year were listed as 100-1, and he wanted to place a $1,000 bet on his team. The gambler told his friend that he would pay him for his efforts. After further discussion, the gambler wrote up the following agreement:\"I hereby promise to pay my friend $100 if he will place a $1,000 bet for me that my favorite team will win the college football championship next year. The bet is to be placed at my lucky casino sports book.

Since the gambler's lucky casino no longer had a sports book at which to place the bet, all contractual obligations would be suspended under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n\nassistant:The best defense for the gambler in this situation would be option B: \"The friend's placing the $1,000 bet at the other casino instead of at the gambler's lucky casino constituted a material breach of contract, thereby relieving the gambler of any further contractual obligations under the terms of their agreement.\"\n\nThis is because the gambler's agreement was contingent on the friend placing the bet at the gambler's lucky casino, which was no longer available. Since the friend did not fulfill this condition, the gambler is not obligated to pay the remaining $100.\n\nThe other options do not provide a valid defense for the gambler. Option A is not applicable because the contract was not void ab initio (void from the beginning) due to the fact that the contract could not be performed in its entirety within one year. Option C is irrelevant to the gambler's defense as it does not affect the validity of the contract or the gambler's obligation to pay the friend. Option D is also not applicable because the doctrine of frustration of purpose does not apply in this situation, as there was no external event or circumstance that prevented the contract from being performed.",
