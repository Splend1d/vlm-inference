Maternal UPD 15\nB. Paternal UPD 15\nC. Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15\nD. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter\n\nassistant:Answer: A. Maternal UPD 15\n\nAngelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the UBE3A gene, which is located on the paternally derived chromosome 15. When the UBE3A gene is mutated or missing, it can lead to the development of Angelman syndrome. In some cases, the disorder can be caused by an extra copy of chromosome 15 (UPD 15) that is inherited from the mother. This is known as maternal UPD 15.\n\nB. Paternal UPD 15 and C. Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15 are also possible causes of Angelman syndrome, but they are less common. In these cases, the extra or missing genetic material is inherited from the father.\n\nD. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter is not a common cause of Angelman syndrome, but it can lead to the disorder in some cases. The SNRPN promoter is a region of DNA that controls the expression of the UBE3A gene. When this region is mutated, it can affect the expression of the UBE3A gene and lead to the development of Angelman syndrome.",
