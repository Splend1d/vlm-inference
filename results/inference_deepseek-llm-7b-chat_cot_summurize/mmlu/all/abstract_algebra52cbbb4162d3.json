False, True\n\nassistant:The answer is B.\n\nStatement 1 is false. The function f does not necessarily have to be injective (one-to-one). For example, consider f(x) = x and g(y) = x. For any x in A, g(f(x)) = x, but x is not necessarily unique.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The function f must necessarily be surjective (onto). For any b in B, there exists an a in A such that f(a) = b. Since g(f(a)) = a, and g is the inverse of f, this implies that for any b in B, there exists an a in A such that g(b) = a. Therefore, f is surjective.",
