Increasing AD with constant SRAS: In this case, the aggregate demand (AD) is increasing, and the aggregate supply (AS) remains constant. This can lead to an increase in prices and economic growth, not stagflation.\n\nB. Decreasing SRAS with constant AD: In this scenario, the aggregate demand remains constant, but the aggregate supply is decreasing. This leads to a decrease in output and prices, not stagflation.\n\nC. Decreasing AD with constant SRAS: In this case, the aggregate demand is decreasing, and the aggregate supply remains constant. This leads to a decrease in output and prices, not stagflation.\n\nD. Decreasing both AD and SRAS: In this scenario, both aggregate demand and aggregate supply are decreasing. This leads to a decrease in output, prices, and economic growth, which is characteristic of stagflation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Decreasing both AD and SRAS.",
