A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of truth values for a logical expression and shows the result of that expression for each combination.\n\nHere's the truth table for the given argument:\n\n| I | J | I \u2228 J | I \u2261 ~J |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T | F |\n| T | F | T | F |\n| F | T | T | F |\n| F | F | F | F |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth values of the expressions in the table:\n\n1. I \u2261 ~J:\n- If I is true and J is false, the result is false (F).\n- If I is false and J is true, the result is true (T).\n\n2. I \u2228 J:\n- If I is true and J is true, the result is true (T).\n- If I is false and J is true, the result is true (T).\n- If I is true and J is false, the result is true (T).\n- If I is false and J is false, the result is false (F).\n\nNow, let's determine whether the argument is valid or invalid based on the truth table:\n\nThe argument states that I \u2261 ~J and I \u2228 J.\n\nUsing the truth table, we can see that the first condition (I \u2261 ~J) is false for all combinations of truth values for I and J. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nThere are several counterexamples for the invalidity of the argument. One example is when I is true and J is false. In this case, I \u2261 ~J is true (F), and I \u2228 J is true (T). This counterexample shows that the argument is not valid because the first condition (I \u2261 ~J) is true, while the second condition (I \u2228 J) is also true.\n\nAnother example is when J is true and I is false. In this case, I \u2261 ~J is true (F), and I \u2228 J is true (T). This counterexample also shows that the argument is not valid because the first condition (I \u2261 ~J) is true, while the second condition (I \u2228 J) is also true.",
