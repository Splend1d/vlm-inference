It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax\n\nA. constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.\nB. constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.\n\nThe court is likely to declare the $200 per year excise tax unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce. This is because the tax is imposed on commercial photographic studios located within the city, which could potentially restrict the freedom of commercial photographers to conduct their business in the city. The tax could discourage photographers from operating in the city, which would limit their ability to conduct business and engage in interstate commerce.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The court is unlikely to declare the tax constitutional as a nondiscriminatory license tax because it is not a tax on licenses, but rather on the use of the city's streets and sidewalks.\n\nB. The tax is not imposed on instruments of interstate commerce, but rather on the use of the city's streets and sidewalks. Therefore, it is not a tax on interstate commerce.\n\nD. The tax is not discriminatory, as it is imposed on both commercial photographic studios and itinerant commercial photographers. It applies equally to both, regardless of whether they have a studio in the city or not.",
