The water molecules collide with the alcohol molecules, transferring energy until the average kinetic energy of both the water and alcohol molecules are the same.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the Law of Equilibrium Temperature, which states that when two fluids are mixed, the temperature of the mixture will eventually reach the average temperature of the two fluids. This occurs because the water molecules and alcohol molecules collide with each other, transferring energy until their average kinetic energy is the same. This causes the temperature of the mixture to rise until it reaches the average temperature of the two fluids. The other options do not accurately explain this phenomenon.",
