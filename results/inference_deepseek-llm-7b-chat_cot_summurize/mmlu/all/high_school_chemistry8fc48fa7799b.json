H2S\nB. HI\nC. HBr\nD. H2O\n\nassistant:To determine which of the following acids should be the strongest, we need to consider the electronegativity and bond strength between the hydrogen and the other element in each molecule.\n\n1. H2S - hydrogen sulfide: The electronegativity difference between hydrogen and sulfur is 0.52 (hydrogen) and 2.3 (sulfur), respectively. The bond strength between hydrogen and sulfur is relatively weak due to the smaller electronegativity difference.\n\n2. HI - hydrogen iodide: The electronegativity difference between hydrogen and iodine is 0.34 (hydrogen) and 2.6 (iodine), respectively. The bond strength between hydrogen and iodine is relatively strong due to the larger electronegativity difference.\n\n3. HBr - hydrogen bromide: The electronegativity difference between hydrogen and bromine is 0.24 (hydrogen) and 2.2 (bromine), respectively. The bond strength between hydrogen and bromine is relatively strong due to the larger electronegativity difference.\n\n4. H2O - water: The electronegativity difference between hydrogen and oxygen is 0.44 (hydrogen) and 3.4 (oxygen), respectively. The bond strength between hydrogen and oxygen is relatively weak due to the smaller electronegativity difference.\n\nBased on the given electronegativity and bond strength, the strongest acid among the given options is:\n\nB. HI - hydrogen iodide.",
