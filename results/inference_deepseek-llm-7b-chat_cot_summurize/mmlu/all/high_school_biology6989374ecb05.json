This is an example of\n\nA. directional selection.\nB. stabilizing selection.\nC. disruptive selection.\nD. sympatric speciation.\n\nassistant:A. directional selection.\n\nThis is an example of directional selection because the change in the availability of resources is causing a shift in the relative frequencies of tall and short individuals, with medium-sized individuals becoming more common. This is a type of selection that favors certain traits over others, in this case, medium size.\n\nB. stabilizing selection is incorrect because it favors the maintenance of a stable population, not a shift in the relative frequencies of different traits.\nC. disruptive selection is incorrect because it favors the spread of a particular trait into a new environment, not a shift in the relative frequencies of different traits within a population.\nD. sympatric speciation is incorrect because it refers to the formation of new species in the same habitat, not a shift in the relative frequencies of different traits within a population.",
