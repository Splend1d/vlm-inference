The owner knew that the tenant was dealing drugs from his apartment and that this had led to violent confrontations in the past. Therefore, the owner should have taken reasonable steps to prevent the dangerous situation from occurring, and should be held liable for the injuries sustained by the neighbor. The fact that the owner didn't take any action to try to evict the tenant is evidence that the owner knew about the dangerous situation and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent it.",
