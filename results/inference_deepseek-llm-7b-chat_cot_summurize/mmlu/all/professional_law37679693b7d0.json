Yes, because a challenge to jurisdiction can be made at any time, even after judgment has been entered, and here the jurisdictional requirement was missing.\n\nThe employer's challenge to jurisdiction is a valid one, and the appellate court is likely to uphold the lower court's decision to dismiss the case. The employer's claim that it did not have at least 15 employees as required by the definition of an \"employer\" under the civil rights statute is a valid jurisdictional challenge. Under Federal Rule 12(b)(6), a party can challenge the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time, even after a judgment has been entered. In this case, the lower court agreed with the employer's challenge and dismissed the case, voiding the previous judgment. The appellate court is likely to affirm the lower court's decision based on the validity of the jurisdictional challenge.",
