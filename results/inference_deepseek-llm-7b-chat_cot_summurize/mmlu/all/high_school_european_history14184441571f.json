This suggests that Calvinists may have been more focused on the individual's relationship with God and their personal faith, rather than using religion as a political tool to gain independence from other religious or political powers.\n\nOn the other hand, Lutherans used the reformed faith to their advantage in order to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire. This indicates that Lutherans may have been more focused on using religion for political purposes and gaining independence, which could be a key difference between the two groups.",
