Quantity supplied of pears falls.\n\nWhen the price of pears increases, it becomes more expensive for consumers. As a result, some consumers may choose to consume other fruits or reduce their fruit consumption altogether, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded of pears. However, the supply of pears is not directly affected by changes in price. Instead, it is affected by factors such as changes in production costs, changes in crop yields, and changes in the supply of labor and capital. Therefore, when the price of pears increases, the quantity supplied of pears is likely to fall, as some producers may choose to reduce their production in response to the higher price.",
