Upon entry, the proton is moving in a straight line along the axis of the solenoid. Which of the following is a correct description of the proton\u2019s motion within the solenoid?\n\nA. The proton will be bent in a parabolic path.\nB. The proton will be bent in a circular path.\nC. The proton will continue in its straight path at constant velocity.\nD. The proton will continue in its straight path and slow down.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The proton will continue in its straight path at constant velocity.\n\nWhen a charged particle enters a solenoid, it experiences an electromagnetic force due to the magnetic field generated by the solenoid. The direction of the force is perpendicular to the direction of the particle's motion and the magnetic field lines. This force causes the particle to be deflected or bent, but it does not change its speed or direction of motion. In this case, the proton will be bent along the axis of the solenoid but will continue to move in a straight line at constant velocity.",
