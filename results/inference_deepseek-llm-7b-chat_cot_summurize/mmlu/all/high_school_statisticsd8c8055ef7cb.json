The probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72. The probability that they both ask her is 0.18. The probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6. What is the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom?\n\nA. 0.78\nB. 0.3\nC. 0.24\nD. 0.48\n\nassistant:To find the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom, we can use the complementary probability rule. The complementary probability of an event A occurring is 1 minus the probability of A not occurring.\n\nThe complementary probability of at least one of them asking Charlene is 1 minus the probability that neither of them ask her.\n\nP(neither Alfred nor Ben asks Charlene) = 0.3 (probability that both Alfred and Ben don't ask her)\n\nP(at least one of them asks Charlene) = 1 - P(neither Alfred nor Ben asks Charlene) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that Ben asks Charlene. Since we know the probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72, and the complementary probability of at least one of them asking her is 0.7, we can find the probability that Ben doesn't ask her as follows:\n\nP(neither Alfred nor Ben asks Charlene) = 0.7 (probability that neither of them ask her)\nP(Alfred asks Charlene) = 0.6 (probability that Alfred asks Charlene)\nP(Ben asks Charlene) = 1 - P(Alfred asks Charlene) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n\nNow we can use the complementary probability rule again:\n\nP(Ben asks Charlene) = 1 - P(neither Alfred nor Ben asks Charlene) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3\n\nSo, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.3, which corresponds to option B.",
