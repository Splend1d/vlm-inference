Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between the three values?\n\nA. The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is larger, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a greater effective nuclear charge.\nB. The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has fewer protons but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has less valence electrons.\nC. The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has less electrons, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen is smaller.\nD. The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is smaller, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a smaller effective nuclear charge.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The electronegativity of nitrogen is between phosphorus and oxygen because nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 electrons, which makes it smaller than phosphorus with 15 electrons and larger than oxygen with 8 electrons. The effective nuclear charge is the reason for the difference in electronegativity values.\n\nA. nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus because it has fewer electrons (7) than phosphorus (15), and more electronegative than oxygen because it has a smaller effective nuclear charge than oxygen (which has a larger atomic radius).\n\nB. nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus because it has fewer electrons (7) than phosphorus (15), but more electronegative than oxygen because it has a greater effective nuclear charge than oxygen.\n\nC. nitrogen is more electronegative than phosphorus because it has fewer electrons (7) than phosphorus (15), but less electronegative than oxygen because it has a smaller effective nuclear charge than oxygen.\n\nD. nitrogen is more electronegative than phosphorus because it has fewer electrons (7) than phosphorus (15), but less electronegative than oxygen because it has a smaller effective nuclear charge than oxygen.",
