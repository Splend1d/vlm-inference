None of these\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Totally internally reflects:\nThis means that the light beam would bounce off the water surface and be reflected internally, but this option does not match the given angle.\n\nB. Passes into the air above:\nIf the angle of the flashlight is 20\u00b0 and the light beam is pointing upward, the light would not pass into the air above.\n\nC. Is absorbed:\nThe light would not be absorbed by the water, as it is not in direct contact with the water surface.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. None of these.",
