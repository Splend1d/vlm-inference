The passengers and pilot, all citizens of State B, were killed in the crash.

A motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\nD. A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C.\n\nassistant:The most likely motion to accomplish the airline's goal of preventing the State A federal court from hearing the action would be a motion to dismiss the action for improper venue. Improper venue occurs when the proper venue for a lawsuit is in another location, and the defendant cannot be required to defend in the chosen location. In this case, the airline is incorporated and has its maintenance facilities and principal place of business in State C, which is not State A. Therefore, the airline may argue that the proper venue for the lawsuit is in State C, not State A. If the court grants the airline's motion to dismiss for improper venue, it would transfer the case to the federal court in State C. The other options, such as a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or the doctrine of forum non conveniens, may not be as likely to accomplish the airline's goal of preventing the State A federal court from hearing the action.",
