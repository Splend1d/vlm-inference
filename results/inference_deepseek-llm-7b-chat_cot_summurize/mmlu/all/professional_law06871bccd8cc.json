No, because the risk to the engineer's health excused his nonperformance of the contract.\n\nExplanation: The engineer had a rare allergic reaction to a chemical agent in the mine air system and became very ill, which justified his decision to quit. Therefore, the coal mine would not be able to recover damages for breach of contract.",
