This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. People may have different opinions on who the \"right\" candidate should be, but voting for someone based on their innocence is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character and their sister engaged in a close sexual relationship. This action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While people's moral standards may vary, most people consider incest to be morally wrong and unacceptable.",
