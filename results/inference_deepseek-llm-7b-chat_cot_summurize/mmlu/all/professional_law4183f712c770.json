Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n\nassistant:D. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistent statement.\n\nThe prosecutor's proposed cross-examination is proper because the defendant's statement, \"They've got the wrong person for this, because I have an alibi,\" constitutes a prior inconsistent statement. In this context, an alibi is a statement or claim that the defendant was somewhere other than the scene of the crime at the time the crime was committed. If the defendant made this statement to the witness shortly after his arrest, it would suggest that the defendant did not have an alibi at the time of the crime. Therefore, the witness's failure to mention this statement when the police asked her about it could be seen as a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nThe prosecutor can use this prior inconsistent statement to impeach the witness's credibility, which is the process of attacking the witness's credibility by showing that their testimony is inconsistent with their prior statements or conduct. This is a common tactic used by prosecutors in cross-examination, as it can help to undermine the credibility of the witness and cast doubt on their testimony.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistent statement.",
