Monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery.\nB. Joint-stock companies sponsored colonization efforts in the western and eastern hemispheres.\nC. Trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.\nD. The Scientific Revolution and the discovery of heliocentricity.\n\nassistant:The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was a diplomatic agreement between King John II of Portugal and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. The treaty was designed to resolve a dispute over the discovery and exploration of lands in the New World. The treaty established a line of demarcation, known as the Treaty Line or Tordesillas Line, that divided the newly discovered lands in the Western Hemisphere between the two monarchs. The treaty also provided for the division of any lands or islands discovered to the east of this line between Portugal and Spain.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas is an example of monarchs being involved in and interested in voyages of discovery. It demonstrates the involvement of European monarchs in the exploration and colonization of the New World, and their desire to assert control over these newly discovered territories.\n\nOption B, Joint-stock companies sponsored colonization efforts in the western and eastern hemispheres, is not supported by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The treaty does not mention joint-stock companies or their involvement in the colonization of the New World.\n\nOption C, Trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa, is not directly related to the Treaty of Tordesillas. While the treaty does not mention guns or slaves, it is important to note that the slave trade in the Americas was a later development that emerged after the signing of the treaty.\n\nOption D, The Scientific Revolution and the discovery of heliocentricity, is not directly related to the Treaty of Tordesillas. While the Scientific Revolution was a period of great scientific and intellectual change in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries, the discovery of heliocentricity is not mentioned in the treaty.\n\nTherefore, the Treaty of Tordesillas provides evidence for the historical development that monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery.",
