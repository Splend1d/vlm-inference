He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory. This is because the woman provided financial support to the household, while the man had better credit and ability to obtain a mortgage in his name. This unequal contribution to the property's acquisition and maintenance could be considered unjust enrichment, and the woman may be entitled to restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.",
