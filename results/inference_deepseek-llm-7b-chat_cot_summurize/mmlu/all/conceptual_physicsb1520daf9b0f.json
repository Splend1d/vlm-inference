When you look at the red petals of a rose, the color light you're seeing is actually red. The petals reflect red light, which is what makes them appear red to your eyes. The other options are incorrect because white minus red is not a color, green and yellow are not the primary colors that make up the red petals, and a mixture of green and yellow would not produce a red color.",
