A filibuster is a tactic used by one or more senators to delay or prevent the passage of a bill by speaking continuously and tediously, often without addressing the merits of the bill. When a motion for cloture is filed, it triggers a debate on whether the filibuster should be allowed to continue. If a majority of senators vote to end the filibuster, the motion for cloture is successful, and the bill is put to a vote.",
