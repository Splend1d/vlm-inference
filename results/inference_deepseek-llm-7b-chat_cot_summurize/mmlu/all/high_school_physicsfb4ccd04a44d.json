The elevator moves upward, speeding up. What is the action-reaction force pair to the man\u2019s weight?\n\nA. The force of the elevator cable on the man\nB. The force of the man on the scale\nC. The force of the elevator cable on the elevator\nD. The force of the man on the Earth\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The force of the man on the Earth. When the elevator moves upward, the man's weight acts on the Earth, and the Earth exerts a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the man's weight on him. This is known as the action-reaction principle, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, the force of the man's weight on the Earth is the action-reaction force pair to his weight.",
