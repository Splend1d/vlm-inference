However, determining the exact amount of happiness or pleasure and pain or unhappiness for each person involved in an action can be a complex and demanding process. Therefore, some people argue that the principle of utility is too demanding.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because the principle of utility is not too complicated (option A), and it is not easy to satisfy (option C).",
