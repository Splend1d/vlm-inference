In Scenario 2, the main character is walking around in their muddy boots outside before cleaning them, which may not meet the ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, but it's not clearly morally wrong. The other options are wrong because they indicate that both scenarios involve clearly morally wrong actions, which is not the case.",
