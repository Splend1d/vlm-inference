He is best known for his work on the philosophy of religion, and is particularly well-known for his development of the concept of the \"Five Ways\" to prove the existence of God.\n\nOne of the \"Five Ways\" is known as the \"Argument from Motion,\" which is based on the idea that if there is something that cannot move itself, it must be moved by something else. Aquinas expands on this idea by arguing that there must be a first cause that is uncaused and unmoved, and that this cause is God.\n\nThe concept of an \"infinite regress of causes\" refers to the idea that there could be a series of causes that are all dependent on one another, with each cause being the effect of the one before it. According to Aquinas, this idea is possible, but not necessarily true. He argues that while it is possible that there could be an infinite regress of causes, it is also possible that there is an uncaused cause at the beginning of the chain of causes.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B. possible.",
