The identity element of this group is\n\nA. 0\nB. 1\nC. -1\nD. 12\n\nassistant:To determine the identity element of the group, we need to find the element that, when multiplied by any other element in the group, leaves the other element unchanged.\n\nLet's consider the given operation \"*\":\na*b = a + b + 1\n\nThe identity element is the element that, when combined with any other element in the group, does not change the value of the other element.\n\nFor the group of integers Z under the operation \"*\", the identity element is 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0",
