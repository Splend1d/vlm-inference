How many times does the object reverse direction?\n\nA. none\nB. one\nC. two\nD. three\n\nassistant:To determine how many times the object reverses direction, we need to find the points at which the object changes direction. To do this, we need to find the points at which the object's velocity is zero. The velocity function is v(t) = t cos(t) - ln (t + 2).\n\nWe can find the critical points of the function by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero:\n\nv'(t) = dv(t)/dt = t sin(t) - 1/t + 2\n\nSetting v'(t) equal to zero:\n\nt sin(t) - 1/t + 2 = 0\n\nSolving this equation for t, we get:\n\nt = 2*cos(t)\n\nNow, we can set t equal to 0 and 10 and solve for the critical points:\n\nt(0) = 2*cos(0) = 2\nt(10) = 2*cos(10) = 2*cos(20) = 4\n\nThe object changes direction at t = 0 and t = 10. Since the object starts at t = 0, it will change direction one more time at t = 10.\n\nTherefore, the object reverses direction two times. The answer is C. two.",
