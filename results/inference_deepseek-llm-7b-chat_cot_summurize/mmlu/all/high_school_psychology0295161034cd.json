Which of the following concepts is most closely related to the goal of this study?\n\nA. difference threshold\nB. absolute threshold\nC. taste constancy\nD. sensory adaptation\n\nassistant:The concept most closely related to the goal of this study is the difference threshold. This study is trying to determine the smallest amount of salt that can be detected by a person's taste buds, which is related to the difference threshold, which is the smallest difference that can be detected between two stimuli. The other options are not directly related to the goal of the study: absolute threshold is the smallest amount of a stimulus needed to be perceived, taste constancy is the consistency of a taste sensation over time and space, and sensory adaptation is when the sensitivity of a sense decreases in response to continuous stimulation.",
