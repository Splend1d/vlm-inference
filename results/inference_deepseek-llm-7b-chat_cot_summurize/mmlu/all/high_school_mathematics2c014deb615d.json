What was her mean score?\n\nA. 92\nB. 93\nC. 94.5\nD. 95\n\nassistant:To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of scores. In this case, Jane had 5 scores. So, we add up the scores: 98 + 97 + 92 + 85 + 93 = 465. Then, we divide by the number of scores: 465 / 5 = 93. Therefore, the mean score for Jane was 93.\n\nThe answer is B. 93.",
