The motel has a strict policy permitting adults only to occupy the rooms. The state has recently enacted a statute that prohibits the showing of any obscene film in an area open to the public. The owner of the motel is prosecuted for violating the statute by showing pornographic movies in the motel rooms. On appeal, the owner's conviction will probably be\n\nA. sustained, because a state can use its police power to prohibit the showing of pornography in public areas.\nB. sustained, because a state may use local standards in determining whether a movie has redeeming literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit.\nC. overturned, because his prosecution violates the right of consenting adultsto view such films in private.\nD. overturned, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the suppression of sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly obscene contents.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. overturned, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the suppression of sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly obscene contents.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, which includes the right to express oneself through speech, writing, and other forms of communication. This means that individuals have the right to express their opinions, beliefs, and ideas, and to share information and ideas with others. The First Amendment also protects the right to receive information, including information about sex and sexuality.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees equal protection of the laws to all citizens. This means that the government cannot discriminate against individuals based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.\n\nIn this case, the owner of the motel is being prosecuted for showing pornographic movies in the privacy of his rooms, which are intended for adults only. The state's statute prohibits the showing of any obscene film in an area open to the public. However, the statute does not apply to the privacy of the motel rooms, where consenting adults are allowed to view such films. Therefore, the prosecution of the motel owner for violating the statute is a violation of his right to freedom of speech and equal protection under the law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the state's police power does not give it the right to prohibit the showing of pornography in public areas. The state's police power allows it to regulate and control public spaces to ensure public safety, health, and welfare. However, it does not give the state the right to prohibit the private viewing of pornographic materials by consenting adults.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a state may not use local standards to determine whether a movie has redeeming literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit. The First Amendment applies equally to all individuals and protects the right to express oneself through speech, writing, and other forms of communication, regardless of where the expression occurs.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the right of consenting adults to view such films in private is not violated by the state's statute. The statute only prohibits the showing of obscene films in public areas, not in private spaces where consenting adults are allowed to view such materials.",
