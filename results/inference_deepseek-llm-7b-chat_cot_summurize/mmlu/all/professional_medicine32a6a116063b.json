Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities, but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins?\n\nA. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)\nB. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)\nC. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)\nD. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)\n\nassistant:This patient's symptoms of diffuse weakness and tingling of the arms and legs, as well as decreased sensation to vibration and position, are consistent with a deficiency of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, and a deficiency in this vitamin can lead to a condition known as pernicious anemia, which can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by the production of large, immature red blood cells. Treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency typically involves supplementation with the vitamin, either through diet or injections. In severe cases, treatment may also include erythropoietin to stimulate the production of red blood cells.",
