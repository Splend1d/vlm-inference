Opposing counsel agreed not to object to the late notice of appeal.\n\nassistant:All of the reasons listed could potentially constitute sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to enable a litigant to file a late notice of appeal past the 30-day deadline. However, the most likely reasons to be considered sufficient good cause or excusable neglect would be A (the district court judge assuring the litigant that the late filing would be permitted) and C (the litigant running a red light causing a car crash just before the judgment was rendered, and being in the hospital for two months recovering). These two options involve situations that could be considered beyond the control of the litigant and could result in excusable neglect. The other two options, while they may be valid reasons for the late filing, are less likely to be considered sufficient good cause or excusable neglect.",
