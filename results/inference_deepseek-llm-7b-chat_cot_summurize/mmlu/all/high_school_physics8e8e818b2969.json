Have equal magnitudes and form an action-reaction pair.\n\nIn this case, the person is standing on a horizontal floor, and the downward force of gravity is acting on them. The upward normal force of the floor is acting in the opposite direction of the downward force of gravity, and it acts along the surface of the floor. These two forces have equal magnitudes and are acting on opposite sides of the person, which means they form an action-reaction pair.",
