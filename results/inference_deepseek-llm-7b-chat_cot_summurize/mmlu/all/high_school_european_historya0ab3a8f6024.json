Beeton's emphasis on the role of a mistress of the house and her belief that a leader's spirit will be seen throughout the establishment indicate that she held a strong belief in the importance of women's roles within the domestic sphere of social life.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention women's power or responsibility in the public sphere of social life.\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that women were denied power and responsibility in the domestic sphere of social life.\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that women were denied power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: women held considerable power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life. This is supported by Beeton's emphasis on the importance of household duties and the mistress of the house's role in setting the tone for the entire establishment.",
