The evidence is admissible to show frustration of purpose.\n\nThe court should rule that the owner's offer to prove the chef's refusal to approve the tomatoes is admissible to show frustration of purpose. This means that the owner's refusal to pay for the tomatoes was not a breach of the contract, but rather a legitimate defense based on the chef's refusal to approve the tomatoes. The written contract may have been a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement, but the oral agreement between the owner and the distributor that the chef must approve the tomatoes before payment is also a valid condition precedent that must be satisfied before the owner is obligated to pay. Therefore, the evidence should be admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.",
