Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s\n\nassistant:The Populist Party Platform of 1892 emphasized the need for a more perfect union, justice, domestic tranquility, the common defense, the general welfare, and the blessings of liberty. This platform called for a government of the \"plain people\" and aimed to restore the government of the Republic to their hands.\n\nOption A, Progressivism of the early 1900s, does not share many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party. Progressivism was focused on social and economic reform, rather than the political system itself.\n\nOption B, Neoconservatism of the 1980s, also does not share many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party. Neoconservatism is a political ideology that emphasizes traditional values, national security, and free markets, but it does not focus on restoring the government to the \"plain people\" or the need for a more perfect union.\n\nOption C, Federalism of the late 1700s, predates the Populist Party and its goals, as it was a political system in place before the formation of the Republic.\n\nOption D, Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s, is the most closely aligned with the goals of the Populist Party. Jacksonian Democracy was a political movement that emerged in the early 1800s and sought to restore the government to the people, emphasizing the need for a more perfect union, justice, domestic tranquility, the common defense, the general welfare, and the blessings of liberty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s.",
