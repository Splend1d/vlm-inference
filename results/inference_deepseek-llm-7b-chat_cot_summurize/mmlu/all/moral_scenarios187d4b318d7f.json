Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character leaves twenty dollars on a random stranger's car, which is a morally good action. In Scenario 2, the main character is building a bomb shelter, which could be seen as morally ambiguous depending on the context, but it does not involve any clear morally wrong actions. Therefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in both scenarios.",
