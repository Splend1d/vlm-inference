According to Newton's second law of motion, an object will accelerate at a constant rate in a straight line if the net force acting on it is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Therefore, if the sum of all the vector forces on a mass is zero, the object will accelerate at a constant rate in a straight line.",
