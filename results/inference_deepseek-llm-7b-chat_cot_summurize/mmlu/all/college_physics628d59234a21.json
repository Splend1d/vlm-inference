In the observer\u2019s reference frame, how long does it take the stick to pass the observer ?\n\nA. 1.6 ns\nB. 2.5 ns\nC. 4.2 ns\nD. 6.9 ns\n\nassistant:To calculate the time it takes for the meter stick with a speed of 0.8c to pass the observer, we can use the Lorentz factor formula:\n\nt = \u0394t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t is the time in the observer's reference frame, \u0394t is the time in the rest frame of the meter stick, and v is the velocity of the meter stick in the observer's reference frame.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the velocity of the meter stick from the observer's reference frame to the rest frame of the meter stick. Since the speed of light is constant, we can use the relativistic addition formula:\n\nv = sqrt(c^2 - (u \\* v)^2)\n\nwhere u is the velocity of the meter stick in the direction it is moving (0.8c).\n\nv = sqrt(c^2 - (0.8c \\* 0.8c)) = sqrt(c^2 - 0.64c^2) = sqrt(0.36c^2) = 0.36c\n\nNow we can use the Lorentz factor formula:\n\nt = \u0394t * sqrt(1 - 0.36/c^2)\n\nSince the meter stick is moving at 0.8c, its time dilation factor is sqrt(1 - 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.4) = 0.707.\n\nt = \u0394t * 0.707\n\nNow we need to find the time in the rest frame of the meter stick. Since the meter stick is at rest in its own reference frame, the time dilation factor is 1.\n\n\u0394t = 1\n\nNow we can solve for the time in the observer's reference frame:\n\nt = 1 * 0.707 = 0.707\n\nSince the answer options are not given in seconds, it is not possible to determine which option corresponds to the correct answer.",
