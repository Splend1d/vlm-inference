When he refused to answer any of their questions, the police put the student in the back seat of a police car.

In such a case, the police would not have had legal justification to detain him, and thus the student may prevail in his claim. It is important to note that this answer assumes that the student was intoxicated at the time of the incident and therefore may not be aware of his consent.",
