Then, I will examine each option and evaluate whether it addresses the concerns mentioned in the question.\n\nA. Abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament.\nThis option seems to be a negative view on the topic, but it does not directly address the concerns about dependency on aid agencies.\n\nB. Legally abolish aid agencies.\nThis option is also negative and does not address the concerns about dependency on aid agencies.\n\nC. Adopt a social contract approach to the problem of global economic justice.\nThis option suggests a different approach to addressing the issue of poverty and dependency on aid agencies, but it does not directly address the concerns mentioned in the question.\n\nD. Accept the view that we have no negative duties to the poor.\nThis option seems to address the concerns about dependency on aid agencies by acknowledging that there may be no negative duties to the poor.\n\nBased on my analysis, option D is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the concerns about dependency on aid agencies and provides a perspective that may help in resolving the issue.",
