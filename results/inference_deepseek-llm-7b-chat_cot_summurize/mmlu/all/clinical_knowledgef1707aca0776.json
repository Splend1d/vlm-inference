Type I fibres.\nB. Type Ia fibres.\nC. Type IIa fibres.\nD. Type IIX fibres.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Type I fibres.\n\nType I fibres are the fast-twitch muscle fibres that are responsible for short bursts of high-intensity exercise, such as sprinting. These fibres are responsible for generating a lot of force quickly, but they fatigue more rapidly than other types of muscle fibres.\n\nType Ia fibres are a classification within Type I fibres, which are also fast-twitch muscle fibres. Type IIa fibres are a classification within Type II muscle fibres, which are a different type of muscle fibre. Type IIX fibres are not a recognized classification of muscle fibre.",
