God has deemed it desirable. This is according to John Stuart Mill's concept of the \"felicity principle\", which states that the ultimate purpose of human life is to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Mill believed that God's judgment on what is desirable can be inferred from the fact that things that bring us pleasure are naturally desired and sought after.",
