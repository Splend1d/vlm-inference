Its aim is to establish certain offences as universal\nB. Its aim is to deter the commission of certain international crimes\nC. Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of particular crimes\nD. Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of all international crimes\n\nassistant:The purpose of universal jurisdiction is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of certain crimes, regardless of where the crime was committed or the nationality of the perpetrator. This means that a State can exercise jurisdiction over a person who has committed a crime that is considered to be a universal jurisdiction offense, regardless of where the crime was committed or the nationality of the perpetrator.\n\nUniversal jurisdiction is based on the principle that certain crimes, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression, are so serious that they should be considered as crimes of universal jurisdiction. This means that any State can exercise jurisdiction over a person who has committed one of these crimes, regardless of where the crime was committed or the nationality of the perpetrator.\n\nThe aim of universal jurisdiction is to deter the commission of these serious crimes and to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. By allowing any State to exercise jurisdiction over these crimes, it creates a greater sense of responsibility and accountability for the perpetrators of these crimes, and helps to ensure that justice is served.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of particular crimes.",
