Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 1: \"I made friends with the homely girl at school just so I could feel better about myself.\" This behavior is considered morally wrong because it involves exploiting someone for personal gain, which is not an ordinary moral standard. In Scenario 2, the main character stays home because they know they have a fever, which is a responsible and healthy decision, so it is not morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is A: Wrong, Wrong.",
