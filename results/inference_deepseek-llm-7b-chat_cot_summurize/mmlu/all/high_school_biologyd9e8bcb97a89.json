Lamarck believed that the winter wheat plants would become more cold-tolerant over time due to the plants' exposure to colder temperatures.\n\nA. Cuvier was a French naturalist who made important contributions to the field of comparative anatomy.\nB. Hutton was a Scottish geologist who proposed the theory of gradualism in geological change.\nC. Lamarck was a French botanist and zoologist who developed the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics.",
