Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nThe statement made by the friend to his mother is admissible as a statement against penal interest, which is a statement that could subject the speaker to criminal penalties. The confrontation clause of the United States Constitution requires that witnesses be confronted by the accused, but this does not apply to statements against penal interest. Additionally, the statement is not testimonial, as it does not serve to establish the truth of the matter asserted.",
