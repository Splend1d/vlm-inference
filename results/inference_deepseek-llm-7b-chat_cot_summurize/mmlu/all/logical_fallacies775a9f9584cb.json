In this case, the phrase \"Ad antiquitatem\" is Latin for \"By the antiquity,\" which refers to the idea that something is true or better because it is old. This is an example of a false cause fallacy because it wrongly assumes that just because two things happened at the same time, one must have caused the other.",
