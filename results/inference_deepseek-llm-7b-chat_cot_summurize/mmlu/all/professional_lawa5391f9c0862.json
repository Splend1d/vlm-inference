The federal law prohibits the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines, and the state statute regulates the shipment and sale of the pies within its territory. This would likely conflict with the federal law and make the state statute unconstitutional.\n\nThe correct answer is C. unconstitutional, because it affects interstate commerce.",
