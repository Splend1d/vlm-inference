The world economy promotes South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nassistant:The poet is asking the reader to remember the incident at Sharpeville, which occurred in South Africa in 1960. This event was a violent response by the police to protests by black South Africans who were demanding equal rights. The poem highlights the brutality of the police and the oppression faced by the black community. The poet uses the phrase \"what the world whispers\" to emphasize the idea that the world may not be openly acknowledging or opposing the apartheid regime in South Africa.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the poet does not imply that the world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid. Instead, the poet suggests that the world is not openly speaking out against the apartheid regime.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the poet does not discuss subtler forms of discrimination in the context of the world. Instead, the poet focuses on the brutality of the police and the oppression faced by the black community in Sharpeville.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the poem does not explicitly condemn the world for condemning South Africa's discrimination. Instead, the poet focuses on the brutality of the police and the oppression faced by the black community in Sharpeville.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the poem does not discuss the world economy promoting South Africa's discrimination. Instead, the poet focuses on the brutality of the police and the oppression faced by the black community in Sharpeville.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.",
