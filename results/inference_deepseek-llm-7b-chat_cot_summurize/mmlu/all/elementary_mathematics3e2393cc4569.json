There are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class. Which equation can be used to determine the number of students, n, in the entire fourth grade?\n\nA. 5xn= 20\nB. 5+20=n\nC. 20x5=n\nD. 20/n=5\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. 20x5=n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up an equation. We are told that there are 20 students in Mr. Clark's fourth-grade class and that there are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class.\n\nLet's denote the number of students in the entire fourth grade as n. Since there are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class, we can write the equation:\n\n5 \\* 20 = n\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n100 = n\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 20x5=n.",
