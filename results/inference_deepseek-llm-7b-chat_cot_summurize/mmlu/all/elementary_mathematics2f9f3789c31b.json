Each number is less than or equal to 12. The greatest common factor of the two numbersis 2. What are the two numbers?\n\nA. 6 and 10\nB. 5 and 12\nC. 10 and 12\nD. 12 and 15\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to find the two numbers. Since the least common multiple (LCM) of 60 is 60, the two numbers must be multiples of 60. The greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers is 2, which means that the numbers are multiples of 60, but they can have different coefficients (e.g. 60, 120, 180, etc.).\n\nWe are looking for two numbers that are less than or equal to 12. The only two possible pairs that satisfy these conditions are (12, 180) and (10, 180).\n\nNow, let's find the GCF of the two numbers. Since the GCF is 2, the two numbers are multiples of 2. The only two possible pairs that satisfy this condition are (10, 180) and (12, 180).\n\nFinally, let's check if the numbers are the ones we are looking for. The LCM of the two numbers is 180, which is equal to 60 * 3. The GCF of the two numbers is 2, which is equal to the GCF of the two multiples of 60.\n\nTherefore, the two numbers are (10, 180), which corresponds to option B.",
