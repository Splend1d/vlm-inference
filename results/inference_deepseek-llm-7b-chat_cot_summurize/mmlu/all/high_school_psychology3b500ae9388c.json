Light enters the eye through the opening in the iris, which controls the amount of light that enters the eye, and then passes through the lens, which focuses the light on the retina. The retina is a layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals, which are sent to the brain to be processed as images. The blind spot is an area on the retina where there are no photoreceptor cells, so it is not involved in the process of vision.",
