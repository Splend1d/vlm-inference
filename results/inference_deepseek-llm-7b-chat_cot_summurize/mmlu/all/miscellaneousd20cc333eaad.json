Stimulus\nB. Hierarchical\nC. Relocation\nD. Contagious\n\nassistant:B. Hierarchical\n\nThe diffusion of reindeer herding as an economic activity among the Sami in Norway can be classified as a hierarchical diffusion. This type of diffusion refers to the spread of ideas, practices, or technologies from a higher social or cultural level to a lower one. In this case, the Sami people, who were already involved in reindeer herding, adopted the economic activity of reindeer herding from a higher social or cultural level, such as the Norwegian government or other reindeer herding communities. This diffusion process can be observed as the Sami people adopted new practices and technologies related to reindeer herding, such as improved techniques for raising reindeer, which were then disseminated to other Sami communities in Norway.",
