Find $a$.\n\nA. 12^(1/7)\nB. 7^(1/12)\nC. 1\nD. 6\n\nassistant:Let's denote $a$, $b$, and $c$ as $x$, $y$, and $z$ respectively, so we have $x^2/y = 1, y^2/z = 2, z^2/x = 3$. We can multiply the first two equations to get $x^2y^2/z^2 = 1$, which simplifies to $x^2/z^2 = 1$. We can also multiply the last two equations to get $x^2z^2/y^2 = 3$, which simplifies to $xyz^2/y^2 = 3$. We can then rewrite $x^2/z^2 = 1$ as $z^2/x^2 = 1$. We can multiply the two equations $z^2/x^2 = 1$ and $xyz^2/y^2 = 3$ to get $x^2y^2z^4/y^4 = 3$, which simplifies to $x^2z^4/y^4 = 3$. We can then multiply the equations $x^2/z^2 = 1$ and $x^2z^4/y^4 = 3$ to get $x^4/y^4 = 3$. We can then square both sides to get $x^8/y^8 = 9$. We can then multiply both sides by $y^8$ to get $x^8 = 9y^8$. We can then take the eighth root of both sides to get $x = \\sqrt[8]{9y^8}$. We can then substitute this expression for $x$ into the equation $x^2/y^2 = 1$ to get $(\\sqrt[8]{9y^8})^2/y^2 = 1$. We can then square both sides to get $9y^8/y^4 = 1$. We can then multiply both sides by $y^4$ to get $9y^8 = y^8$. We can then subtract $y^8$ from both sides to get $0 = y^8 - y^8$. This equation is true for all values of $y$, so any positive number can be chosen for $y$. Therefore, $a$ can be any positive number.\nThe answer is: 1",
