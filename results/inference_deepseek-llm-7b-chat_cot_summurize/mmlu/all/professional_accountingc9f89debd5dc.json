An opinion about the fairness of the agreed-upon procedures.\n\nThe CPA's report should provide an opinion on whether the agreed-upon procedures were performed fairly and in accordance with the agreed-upon formula. The other options are not typically included in a report on agreed-upon procedures:\n\nB. A separate paragraph describing the effectiveness of the internal controls: This is not typically included in a report on agreed-upon procedures, as these procedures are focused on a specific part of the financial statements (e.g., a specific investment or accounting policy).\n\nC.

A disclaimer of opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements: This is not typically included in a report on agreed-upon procedures, as the procedures are focused on a specific part of the financial statements, not the overall fairness of their presentation.",
