Light\nB. Sound\nC. Radio waves\nD. X-rays\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze the given options and determine which one does not belong to the family of electromagnetic waves.\n\nElectromagnetic waves are a type of energy that travels through space, consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. They are characterized by their wavelength, frequency, and amplitude.\n\nA. Light: Light is a type of electromagnetic wave that has a wavelength in the visible spectrum (400-700 nanometers). It is commonly referred to as visible light.\n\nB. Sound: Sound is not an electromagnetic wave. It is a mechanical wave that requires a medium (such as air or water) to propagate. Sound waves consist of pressure variations that travel through the medium, and they do not involve oscillating electric and magnetic fields.\n\nC. Radio waves: Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave with wavelengths that are much longer than those of visible light. They have frequencies between 3 kHz and 300 GHz, and they are commonly used in radio communication and broadcasting.\n\nD. X-rays: X-rays are also a type of electromagnetic wave, but they have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than visible light. X-rays are used in medical imaging and have a range of 10 picometers to 1 nanometer.\n\nBased on this information, the answer is B. Sound, as it is not an electromagnetic wave.",
