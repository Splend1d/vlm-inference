The cities were planned and laid out in a systematic manner, with streets and buildings aligned in a grid pattern, and public spaces such as parks and markets were well-organized. The cities were also well-equipped with advanced water supply systems, drainage systems, and waste disposal systems.\n\nIn contrast, other early civilizations such as Mesopotamia and Egypt were characterized by more decentralized, rural settlements and less formal urban planning. The Indus Valley civilization was also notable for its advanced writing system, which was one of the earliest known writing systems in the world, and its impressive craftsmanship and art, which can be seen in the beautiful seals, beads, and pottery that have been found in the region.",
