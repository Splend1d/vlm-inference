The prosecutor now wishes to introduce the testimony of a bystander who was in the parking lot and saw the shooting through a nearby window.

An excited utterance is a statement made in the heat of the moment, typically during a sudden and intense event. In this case, the bystander heard the customer scream out, \"Knock that gun away! Don't let her do it again!\" during the course of the robbery and the shooting. This statement was not planned or scripted, and the bystander was reacting to the immediate danger and urgency of the situation. As a result, the statement can be considered an excited utterance, and is admissible as such.",
