Conduction and transduction.\n\nThe human senses can be divided into two major categories based on how they gather information from the outside world: conduction and transduction. Conduction senses, such as sight and hearing, use physical contact with the environment to transmit information to the brain. Transduction senses, such as taste and smell, use specialized cells called receptors to detect and transmit information to the brain.",
