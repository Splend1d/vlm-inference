(60+12)/6=a\n\nassistant:Let's break down the information given in the problem:\n\n1. Jack picks 60 apples from an apple tree.\n2. He uses 12 of them to make applesauce.\n3. He places the remaining apples equally into 6 gift baskets.\n\nWe can represent the number of apples Jack has left after making applesauce as:\n\napples_left = 60 - 12\n\nNow, let's represent the number of apples Jack places into each gift basket as a:\n\na = apples_left / 6\n\nNow let's substitute the expression for apples_left back into the equation for a:\n\na = (60 - 12) / 6\n\na = 48 / 6\n\na = 8\n\nSo, Jack places 8 apples into each gift basket.\n\nNow let's compare the given options with the correct answer:\n\nA. (60/6)\u201412=a\nB. (60\u201412)/6=a\nC. (60-6)-12=a\nD. (60+12)/6=a\n\nOption A: (60/6)\u201412=a\n(60/6) = 10\n10 - 12 = -2\nThis is not the correct answer.\n\nOption B: (60\u201412)/6=a\n(60 - 12) / 6 = 48 / 6\n48 / 6 = 8\nThis is the correct answer.\n\nOption C: (60-6)-12=a\n(60 - 6) - 12 = 54 - 12 = 42\nThis is not the correct answer.\n\nOption D: (60+12)/6=a\n(60 + 12) / 6 = 72 / 6\n72 / 6 = 12\nThis is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is option B: (60\u201412)/6=a.",
