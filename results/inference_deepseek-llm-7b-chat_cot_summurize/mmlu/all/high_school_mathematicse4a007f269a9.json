First, we need to find all the numbers between 100 and 200 that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. We can do this by checking each number in the range and seeing if it is 1 or 2 more than a perfect square.\n\n2. We can start with the smallest number in the range, which is 100. Is 100 1 or 2 more than a perfect square? No, it is not.\n\n3. Next, we have 101. Is 101 1 or 2 more than a perfect square? No, it is not.\n\n4. Now, we have 102. Is 102 1 or 2 more than a perfect square? Yes, it is 1 more than the square of 10, which is 100.\n\n5. Continuing the process for the next numbers in the range, we find that 104, 108, and 112 are also 1 more than perfect squares.\n\n6. We can continue this process for the remaining numbers in the range, and we find that 121 and 129 are also 1 more than perfect squares.\n\n7. Now, we need to find the primes between 100 and 200 that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. From our previous findings, we have the following numbers: 102, 104, 108, 112, 121, and 129.\n\n8. We can now find the sum of these primes: 102 + 104 + 108 + 112 + 121 + 129 = 791.\n\n9. However, we made a mistake in the problem statement. The correct sum of the primes between 100 and 200 that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square is 100.\n\n10. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 100",
