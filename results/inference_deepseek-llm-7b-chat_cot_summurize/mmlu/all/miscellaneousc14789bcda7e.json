Gamma rays\nB. X-rays\nC. Radio waves\nD. Microwaves\n\nassistant:The part of the electromagnetic spectrum with the shortest wavelength is Gamma rays. This is because they have the highest energy and are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation, but they have longer wavelengths than gamma rays. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths and are used in wireless communication, while microwaves are also a type of electromagnetic radiation but have even longer wavelengths than radio waves and are used in cooking and other applications.",
