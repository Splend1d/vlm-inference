Mortality\nB. Loss of social support\nC. Cognitive decline\nD. Independence\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the context of the question: The question is related to the impact of neuroticism on various aspects of life, specifically later in life.\n\n2. Analyze the answer choices: I will evaluate each option to determine which one is most relevant to the context of the question.\n\nA. Mortality: Neuroticism has been linked to increased mortality in some studies. This is because neuroticism can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise.\n\nB. Loss of social support: Neuroticism has also been associated with difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships, which could potentially lead to a loss of social support.\n\nC. Cognitive decline: Neuroticism has not been directly linked to cognitive decline. However, it has been associated with poor mental health, which could potentially lead to cognitive decline if left untreated.\n\nD. Independence: Neuroticism has not been directly linked to independence.\n\n3. Choose the best answer: Based on the analysis, the best answer is A. Mortality, as it is the most directly related to neuroticism later in life.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is: A. Mortality.",
