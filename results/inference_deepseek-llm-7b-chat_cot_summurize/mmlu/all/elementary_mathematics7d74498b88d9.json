What is 794 rounded to the nearest hundred?\n\nA. 700\nB. 794\nC. 800\nD. 894\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to round the number 794 to the nearest hundred.\n\nFirst, let's find the nearest multiple of 100 that is greater than or equal to 794. In this case, the nearest multiple is 800.\n\nNow, let's add the difference between 794 and 800 to find the final rounded number. The difference between 794 and 800 is 6.\n\nFinally, we add 6 to 800 to get the rounded number: 800 + 6 = 806.\n\nTherefore, 794 rounded to the nearest hundred is 800.\nThe answer is \\boxed{C}.",
