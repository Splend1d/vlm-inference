The Employee Retirement Income Security Act\nB. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\nC. The Fair Labor Standards Act\nD. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA is a federal law that sets standards for wages and overtime pay for most private and public employment in the United States. The law requires employers to pay a minimum wage to most workers and to pay time and a half for overtime hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. It also establishes certain rules for child labor and prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The other options are not related to wage and overtime pay standards. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) deals with employee benefit plans, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a federal law that provides economic stimulus during a recession, and the Federal Employees' Compensation Act provides compensation to federal employees who are injured on the job.",
