Since there are 6 vertices, we can start by choosing 2 of them to form a diagonal. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 6 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 6 is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.\n\nNow, we need to consider the order of the vertices in the diagonal. Since the diagonal connects two vertices, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the vertices in the diagonal.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct diagonals is 15 * 2 = 30.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the 6 edges of the hexagon, which are not considered diagonals. So, the final answer is 30 - 6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 36.",
