However, it could be inferred that Kamm might argue that personal choice should be considered, even if one is lacking in imagination.\n\nC. most people's conception of the varieties of goods is limited.\nThis option seems to be a plausible premise for the \"lack of imagination\" argument. Kamm might argue that people with limited imagination are unable to conceive of the full range of goods available to them.\n\nD. we ought to always leave the development of valuable traits up to chance.\nThis option is not directly related to the \"lack of imagination\" argument. It is also not in line with Kamm's argument, as Kamm does not argue that valuable traits should be left up to chance.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. most people's conception of the varieties of goods is limited.",
