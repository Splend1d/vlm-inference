Jurisdiction is ordinarily extra-territorial\nB. Jurisdiction is ordinarily on the high seas\nC. Jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial\nD. Jurisdiction is determined by the location of the offender.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. Jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial.\n\nIn most cases, jurisdiction refers to the authority of a court or other legal authority to hear and decide a case. Jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial, which means that a court has jurisdiction over a case if the events or acts that give rise to the case occurred within the court's geographic jurisdiction. In some cases, jurisdiction may also be extra-territorial, meaning that a court has authority over a case that occurs outside of its geographic jurisdiction if the case has a sufficient connection to the court's jurisdiction. However, this is not the most common type of jurisdiction.\n\nJurisdiction is also determined by the location of the offender, which is an exception to the ordinary territorial jurisdiction. If the offender is located outside of the court's geographic jurisdiction, the court may still have jurisdiction over the case if the offender has consented to the jurisdiction of the court, or if the court has jurisdiction under the principles of international law.\n\nOn the high seas, jurisdiction is generally determined by the laws of the country whose flag the vessel belongs to, and may be different from the ordinary territorial jurisdiction.",
