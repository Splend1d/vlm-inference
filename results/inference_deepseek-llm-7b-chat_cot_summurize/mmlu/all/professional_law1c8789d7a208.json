The court will allow the records because they are the product of a reliable computer process of data collection.\n\nassistant:The court will allow the records because they were kept in the ordinary course of business. This is because the defendant has testified that he kept the records on a regular business basis, which satisfies the requirement of authenticity. The fact that the government objected to the records as hearsay does not matter in this case, as the records are admissible due to their authenticity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The court will allow the records because they were kept in the ordinary course of business.",
