DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase.\nD. chromatin, DNA and amino acids.\n\nassistant:C. DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase.\n\nTranslation is the process by which mRNA sequences in a cell's nucleus are used as templates to produce protein molecules in the cytoplasm. It involves the transfer of genetic information from the DNA molecule to the protein molecule. This process requires three main components:\n\n1. DNA: The genetic information is stored in the form of DNA sequences. These sequences contain the instructions for the synthesis of specific proteins.\n2. mRNA: mRNA is a short, single-stranded molecule that is transcribed from the DNA template. The mRNA molecule contains the genetic information stored in the DNA and carries it to the ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place.\n3. RNA polymerase: RNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the process of transcription, which is the process of copying DNA sequences into RNA sequences. It is the enzyme that binds to the DNA template and synthesizes the mRNA molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase.",
