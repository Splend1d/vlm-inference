This means that the action should not harm or violate the fundamental principles and values that are considered essential for human life and well-being. These values may include things like life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that an action is right if it only indirectly violates some of the basic values. This is not consistent with the basic principle of natural law theory, which requires that an action not violate any of the basic values directly.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that the action is right if it has been favored by the laws of natural selection. While natural law theory may be influenced by evolutionary theories, it is not solely based on these theories. Therefore, the laws of natural selection are not the primary determinant of what is right or wrong according to natural law theory.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that none of the above options are correct. However, option C is the correct answer as it accurately reflects the basic principle of natural law theory.",
