The state-funded military institute's policy of accepting only male students inherently discriminates against women and denies them equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. While the state offered to develop a parallel military school for women, this alternative program is not equal in terms of facilities, faculty, or training intensity to the men's institute. Therefore, the federal district court should find a denial of equal protection and rule in favor of the woman who brought the injunctive action.",
