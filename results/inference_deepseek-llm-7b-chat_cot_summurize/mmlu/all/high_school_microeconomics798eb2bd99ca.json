Demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.\n\nWhen the price of polyester pants, a substitute good for denim jeans, rises, it indicates that the demand for denim jeans increases. This is because the higher price of the substitute good makes the good being substituted for (in this case, denim jeans) relatively cheaper and more attractive to consumers. As a result, more people are willing to buy denim jeans, which leads to an increase in demand.\n\nWhen the demand for a particular good increases, the equilibrium price and quantity of that good will generally rise. In this case, the increased demand for denim jeans will cause the price of denim jeans to rise and the quantity of denim jeans sold in the market to increase.",
