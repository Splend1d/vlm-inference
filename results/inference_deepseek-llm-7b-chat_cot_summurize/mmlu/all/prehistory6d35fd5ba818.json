It is located above the orbits and provides support to the eyebrow muscles.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. sagittal crest: This is a bony ridge that runs down the midline of the skull, connecting the zygomatic bone to the occipital bone.\n\nC. maxilla: This is a bone in the facial region, located in front of the zygomatic bone and below the eye orbits.\n\nD. occipital bone: This is a bone located at the back of the skull, behind the supraorbital torus.",
