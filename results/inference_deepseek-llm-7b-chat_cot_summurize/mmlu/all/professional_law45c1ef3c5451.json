In order to sell lottery tickets directly to the public, the agency established outlets throughout the country, including in a particular state. The state levies a general tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state. The state seeks to tax the agency on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state. Must the agency pay the state gross receipts tax?\n\nA. No, because a federal agency may not pay any monies to a state without explicit federal statutory authorization to do so.\nB. No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\nC. Yes, because it is a generally applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.\nD. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.\n\nUnder the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, federal law generally prevails over state law, but there are exceptions. One of these exceptions is when a state law directly conflicts with a federal statute. In this case, the federal statute establishes a national lottery and creates a new federal agency to administer it. Therefore, the federal agency is subject to federal law, not state law.\n\nThe fact that the state levies a general tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state does not change the fact that the federal agency is exempt from state taxation. The federal agency is not a state actor, and it is not subject to state taxation.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. A federal agency may pay monies to a state if the federal statute authorizes it to do so. In this case, there is no such authorization.\n\nB. The federal government is not a \"person\" within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which generally prohibits states from suing the federal government in federal court. Therefore, the federal government is not subject to lawsuits for state taxes.\n\nC. The fact that the state tax is generally applicable does not matter. The federal agency is not subject to state taxation.",
