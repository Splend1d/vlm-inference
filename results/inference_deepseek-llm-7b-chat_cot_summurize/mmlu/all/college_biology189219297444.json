Sieve tube members and companion cells.\n\nSieve tube members and companion cells are two xylem plant cell types that provide support and conduct water and minerals. Sieve tube members are elongated cells that form a sieve tube network, which is responsible for transporting water and minerals upward through the plant. Companion cells are small, flattened cells that surround the sieve tube members and provide them with nutrients and other resources needed for their function.",
