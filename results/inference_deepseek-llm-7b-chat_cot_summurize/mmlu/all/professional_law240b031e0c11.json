This is because the man did not actually commit a crime inside the house, as he left before doing any damage or stealing anything. The fact that the back door was unlocked and the house was not occupied at the time of his entry would also be relevant, but they do not absolve him of guilt entirely. The man's intention to commit a crime is also relevant, but it is not clear whether he intended to commit a crime inside the house, as he left when he heard sounds outside.",
