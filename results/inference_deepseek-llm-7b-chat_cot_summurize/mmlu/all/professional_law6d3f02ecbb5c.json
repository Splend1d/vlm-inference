He was walking along the sidewalk in front of the store when he slipped on a piece of eel. He brought suit against the owner of the market claiming that he suffered leg and back injuries. The owner, although admitting that the customer was injured by slipping on the eel, denied negligence and claimed that the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness to testify that before the fall he heard someone call out to the customer, \"Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish. \"The witness's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is relevant as to the customer's contributory negligence.\nB. admissible, as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind.\nC. inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it was not a spontaneous utterance.\n\nassistant:The answer is C. Inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.\n\nThe witness's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay, which is a statement made out of court that is offered in court for the purpose of proving the statement's truth. In this case, the statement made by the witness is the customer being called out to watch out for the eel, which is not admissible because it is not a spontaneous utterance and not within any exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Relevance to the customer's contributory negligence is not a valid reason for admissibility. Inadmissible hearsay is inadmissible regardless of its relevance to the case.\n\nB. The statement of the witness's present state of mind is not a valid reason for admissibility. Inadmissible hearsay is inadmissible regardless of the statement's content or whether it is a statement of the declarant's present state of mind.\n\nD. The statement being not a spontaneous utterance is not a valid reason for admissibility. Inadmissible hearsay is inadmissible regardless of whether the statement was spontaneous or not.",
