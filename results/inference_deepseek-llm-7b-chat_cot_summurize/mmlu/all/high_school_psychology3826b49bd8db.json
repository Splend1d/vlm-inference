The social psychology concept that best explains the phenomenon of bystander intervention decreasing when a large number of people witness a crime is diffusion of responsibility. This concept suggests that when there are more people present, individuals are less likely to take action because they assume that someone else will step in to help. This can lead to a feeling of diffusion of responsibility, where individuals feel less accountable for taking action and are therefore less likely to intervene. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
