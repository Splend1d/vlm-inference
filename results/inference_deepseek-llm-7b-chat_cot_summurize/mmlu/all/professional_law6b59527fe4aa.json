No, this does not fit the requirements for either slander per se or libel per se. The doctor is suing for damages per se, which is a specific type of damages that are automatically awarded in cases of certain types of torts, such as false light invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The newspaper's defense that the article was a matter of public interest and that the doctor could not prove any special damages does not apply to damages per se. The court will need to consider whether the doctor has stated a valid claim for damages per se and whether the newspaper's actions meet the requirements for this type of damages.",
