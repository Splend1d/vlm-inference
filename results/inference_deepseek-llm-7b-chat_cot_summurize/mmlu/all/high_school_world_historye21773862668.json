Ambivalence about the future of his economic prospects\n\nassistant:The author's attitude in the passage can be characterized as Cynicism about the loyalty of a ruler's subjects. Machiavelli discusses the fickleness and untrustworthiness of men, emphasizing the importance of being feared over being loved in order to maintain power and security. He portrays men as being driven by self-interest and prone to betrayal, even when they have made promises of loyalty. This perspective reflects a cynical view of human nature and the motivations of those in power.",
