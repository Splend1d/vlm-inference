AVC that first rises, but eventually falls, as output increases.\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns states that as the amount of input increases, the marginal returns (additional output produced for each additional unit of input) will initially increase, but will eventually decrease and eventually turn negative. This means that the additional output produced for each additional unit of input will eventually become negative, indicating that increasing the input further will decrease the output.",
