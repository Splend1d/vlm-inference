On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant whether he had committed false pretenses by making long-distance telephone calls by the unauthorized use of a credit card number. The defendant replied, \"That's a lie, I never did. \" In rebuttal, the prosecuting attorney called the court officer to testif' that the defendant admitted committing false pretenses. The court officer further testified, however, that the defendant was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony against others. The court officer's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, as bearing on the defendant's credibility.\nB. admissible, as bearing on the defendant's guilt.\nC. inadmissible, because the testimony is extrinsic evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because the court order is thebest evidence.\n\nassistant:The court officer's testimony is admissible because it is relevant to the defendant's credibility. The prosecutor's attempt to impeach the defendant's credibility with the testimony of the court officer is a common practice in trials. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nThe prosecutor's testimony about the defendant admitting to false pretenses is inadmissible because it is extrinsic evidence. Extrinsic evidence is evidence that is not directly relevant to the issue at hand but is used to impeach a witness's credibility. In this case, the prosecutor is trying to introduce evidence that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses in order to challenge his credibility. However, the defendant's immunity from prosecution is irrelevant to his credibility as a witness, so this testimony is inadmissible.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the court officer's testimony is not relevant to the defendant's guilt or innocence. It is only relevant to his credibility as a witness.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the court officer's testimony is not the best evidence. The best evidence rule states that the original evidence should be produced in court if a copy is available. In this case, the best evidence would be the written agreement granting the defendant immunity from prosecution. However, the best evidence rule does not apply in all cases, and in this case, the court officer's testimony is admissible.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the court officer's testimony is admissible, not inadmissible.",
