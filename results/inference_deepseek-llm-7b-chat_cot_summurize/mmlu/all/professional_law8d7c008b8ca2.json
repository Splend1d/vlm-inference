The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress.

The court will most likely construe restriction (23) as a (an)\n\nA. negative easement.\nB. equitable servitude.\nC. affirmative covenant.\nD. fee simple absolute.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Negative easement.\n\nExplanation: A negative easement is a legal right that one person has to prevent another person from using their property in a certain way. In this case, the restriction prohibits the construction of any buildings on the strip of land running through the blocks. This is a negative easement because it does not grant any right to the public utility companies, but rather restricts the rights of the landowners.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Equitable servitude: This is a legal right that arises when the use of one person's property is necessary for the enjoyment of another person's property. It is not applicable in this case as there is no mention of the strip of land being necessary for the enjoyment of the surrounding lots.\n\nC. Affirmative covenant: This is a legal agreement that imposes certain restrictions on the use of the property. It is not applicable in this case as there is no mention of an agreement being made by the developers or owners.\n\nD. Fee simple absolute: This is the highest form of ownership where the owner has full rights to the property. It is not applicable in this case as the restriction does not grant any rights, but rather restricts the rights of the landowners.",
