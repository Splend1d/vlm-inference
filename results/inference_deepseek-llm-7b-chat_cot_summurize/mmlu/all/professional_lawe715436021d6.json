The defendant's attorney files a motion to exclude the items from being used as evidence. In this case, the prosecution is seeking to exclude the ski mask but not the money.\n\nThe prosecution's argument for excluding the ski mask would be that the officer did not have a warrant to search the defendant's home, and the search of the closet was conducted without the defendant's consent. The prosecution may argue that the search of the closet was an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nThe prosecution's argument for excluding the money would be that the officer did not have probable cause to believe that the money was connected to the defendant or the bank robberies. The officer did not know that the money was stolen from one of the bank robberies when he confiscated it from the defendant's home. Therefore, the prosecution may argue that the search of the storage room was an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nHowever, the court may deny the motion to exclude the ski mask and the money, as both items may be relevant to the defendant's prosecution for bank robbery. The ski mask could be used as evidence of the defendant's involvement in the bank robberies, as he was seen wearing it during the robberies. The money could also be used as evidence of the defendant's guilt, as it was found in his home and is believed to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. Therefore, the court may deny the motion to exclude both the ski mask and the money.",
