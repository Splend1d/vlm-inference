DNA is made up of nucleotides, which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a base. The two bases in DNA are purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (thymine, cytosine, and uracil). Deoxyribose is the sugar found in DNA, and amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Amino acid.",
