Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character tells a hurtful joke at a funeral.

Ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would likely view this as a social blunder rather than a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character wring the wet salamander, which is morally wrong. This action would be considered cruel and potentially harmful to the salamander. Ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would generally regard this action as clearly morally wrong.",
