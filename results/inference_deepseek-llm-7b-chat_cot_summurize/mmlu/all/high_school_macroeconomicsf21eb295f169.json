The GDP Deflator is a measure of the general level of prices in the economy. It is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP.\n\nLet's use the information given to find the GDP Deflator:\n\nNominal GDP = $5000\nReal GDP = $4000\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\nGDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP) / (Real GDP)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nGDP Deflator = $5000 / $4000\n\nGDP Deflator = 1.25\n\nSo, the answer is B. 1.25.",
