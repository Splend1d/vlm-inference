We will analyze the two given premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: E \u2283 (F \u2228 ~G)\nIf E is true, then the implication is true.\nIf E is false, the implication is false.\nIf F is true, the disjunction is true.\nIf F is false, the disjunction is false (since ~G is also false).\nIf ~G is true, the disjunction is true.\nIf ~G is false, the disjunction is false.\n\nPremise 2: F \u2283 (~E \u2228 ~G)\nIf F is true, the implication is true.\nIf F is false, the implication is true (since ~E is true).\nIf ~E is true, the disjunction is false.\nIf ~E is false, the disjunction is true (since ~G is false).\nIf ~G is true, the disjunction is false.\nIf ~G is false, the disjunction is true.\n\nConclusion: E \u2283 (F \u2228 ~G)\nIf E is true, then the implication is true.\nIf E is false, the implication is false.\nIf F is true, the disjunction is true.\nIf F is false, the disjunction is false (since ~G is also false).\nIf ~G is true, the disjunction is true.\nIf ~G is false, the disjunction is false.\n\nNow let's analyze the contrapositive of the second premise:\n\nPremise 2: contrapositive: ~F \u2283 (~E \u2228 ~G)\nIf ~F is true, the implication is true.\nIf ~F is false, the implication is true (since ~E is true).\nIf ~E is true, the disjunction is false.\nIf ~E is false, the disjunction is true (since ~G is false).\nIf ~G is true, the disjunction is false.\nIf ~G is false, the disjunction is true.\n\nNow let's consider the case when E, F, and G are true:\n\n- E, F, and G are true:\n  - Premise 1: implication is true.\n  - Premise 2: implication is true.\n  - Conclusion: implication is true.\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when E, F, and G are true",
