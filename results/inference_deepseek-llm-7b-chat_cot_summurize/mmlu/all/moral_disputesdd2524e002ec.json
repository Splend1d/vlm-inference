They seem to entail that any instance of killing in self-defense is wrong.\n\nMetz believes that dignity-based arguments based on African values fail because they prove too much. These arguments are based on the idea that capital punishment is degrading and therefore wrong. However, Metz argues that these arguments go too far, as they also seem to entail that any instance of killing in self-defense is wrong. This is because, in some cases, killing in self-defense may be seen as a necessary evil to protect one's dignity and the dignity of others. However, Metz believes that these arguments fail to distinguish between the two situations and, therefore, do not provide a convincing argument against capital punishment.",
