Both would increase.\nB. Both would decrease.\nC. The wage would remain constant, but employment would increase.\nD. The wage would fall, but employment would increase.\n\nassistant:If a monopsony labor market were transformed into a perfectly competitive labor market, the wage and employment would change in the following way:\n\nA. Both would increase.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive labor market, firms compete for workers, and wages are determined by the equilibrium between supply and demand. In a monopsony labor market, one firm dominates the market, which leads to lower wages.\n\nWhen the market becomes perfectly competitive, firms no longer have the power to suppress wages. As a result, the equilibrium wage will increase.\n\nAt the same time, employment will also increase. In a perfectly competitive labor market, firms will be willing to hire more workers as they compete for labor. The increased demand for labor will drive up employment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Both would increase.",
