The corona is made up mostly of charged particles which aren't luminous.\nB. It's much too cool to emit visible light\nC. We can't see magnetic fields\nD. It's too diffuse\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The corona is made up mostly of charged particles which aren't luminous. The Sun's corona is a plasma, which is a type of gas made up of charged particles. These particles are not able to emit visible light, and instead emit radiation in the form of X-rays and other high-energy particles. This is why we can't see the corona with our eyes, but it can be observed during a total solar eclipse when the moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, and the corona can be seen as a glowing, hot halo around the edge of the Sun.",
