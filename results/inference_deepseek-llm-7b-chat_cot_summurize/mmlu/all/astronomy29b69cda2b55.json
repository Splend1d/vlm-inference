They are much more massive than the terrestrial planets.\n\nExplanation: The jovian planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are much more massive than the terrestrial planets like Earth and Mars. This increased mass causes a stronger gravitational force at the equator, which pulls the material closer to the center of the planet. This results in a \"squashed\" appearance and a bulge around the equator. The other options do not explain the \"squashed\" appearance of the jovian planets.",
