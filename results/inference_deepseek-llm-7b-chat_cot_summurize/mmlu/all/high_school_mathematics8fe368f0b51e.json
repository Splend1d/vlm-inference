When the sum of $x$ and $y$ is 42, $x$ is twice $y$. What is the value of $y$ when $x=-8$?\n\nA. -49\nB. -7\nC. -40\nD. 40\n\nassistant:Let $k = \\text{constant}$. We have $xy = k$. Also, we know that $x + y = 42$ and $x = 2y$. Substituting $2y$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $y(2y) = k$. Expanding, we get $2y^2 = k$. Substituting $x = 2y$ for $x$ in the second equation, we have $2y + y = 42$. Simplifying, we get $3y = 42$. Solving for $y$, we find $y = \\boxed{14}$.\nThe answer is: 14",
