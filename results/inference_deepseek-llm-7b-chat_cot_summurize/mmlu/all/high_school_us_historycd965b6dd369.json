Improve conditions in urban neighborhoods\n\nassistant:Settlement houses like Hull House expressed a desire of reformers to improve conditions in urban neighborhoods. \n\nExplanation: The passage describes the establishment of a boarding club by working girls at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory. The club provided a supportive environment for the girls to stand behind each other in times of need. This indicates that the settlement house was aimed at improving the conditions of the urban neighborhoods by providing a helping hand to the residents. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about converting immigrants to Christianity.\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the settlement houses were trying to prevent political radicalism.\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the settlement houses were trying to provide cheap labor for industry.",
