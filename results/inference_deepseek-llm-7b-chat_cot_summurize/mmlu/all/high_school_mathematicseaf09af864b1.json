Find the sum of the digits of $n$.\n\nA. 8\nB. 3\nC. 6\nD. 9\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we first need to find the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers and then find the product of those two numbers. Finally, we will find the sum of the digits of that product.\n\nWe can start by listing the 3-digit prime numbers:\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nNow let's find the two smallest prime numbers that are 3-digit numbers:\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nThe two smallest 3-digit prime numbers are 101 and 151.\n\nNow let's find the product of these two numbers:\n101 * 151 = 15301\n\nFinally, let's find the sum of the digits of 15301:\n1 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10. The sum of the digits of the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers is 10.\n\nThe answer is B.",
