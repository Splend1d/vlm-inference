The plaintiff sued, claiming that the defendant ran a red light. In her case-in-chief, the plaintiff testified that immediately after the accident, a bystander, who was a local resident, screamed at the defendant, \"You jerk. . . you drove through the red light. \" In his case-in-chief, the defendant now calls a police accident investigator to testify that the plaintiff told him that she \"didn't see the color of the light when she entered the intersection because she was dialing a number on her cell phone. \"The investigator's testimony should be\n\nA. admitted, because the plaintiff's inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility.\nB. admitted, because the accident investigator gathered the information in the course of his official duties.\nC. excluded, because the defendant failed to lay a foundation, thus not giving the plaintiff an opportunity to deny or explain her statement.\nD. excluded, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is hearsay.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. excluded, because the defendant failed to lay a foundation, thus not giving the plaintiff an opportunity to deny or explain her statement.\n\nExplanation: In order for the investigator's testimony to be admitted, the defendant must lay a foundation for the witness's testimony. This typically involves showing that the witness is qualified to testify and that the witness had knowledge of the facts in question. In this case, the defendant must establish that the police accident investigator had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's statement, and that the statement was made in the course of the investigator's official duties.\n\nIf the defendant fails to lay this foundation, the plaintiff can object to the testimony on the grounds that it is not properly authenticated. If the court rules that the plaintiff's objection is well-taken, the testimony will be excluded. This is known as the \"failure-to-lay-a-foundation\" rule.\n\nIn this case, the defendant has not laid a foundation for the investigator's testimony, so the plaintiff can object on these grounds. The other answers are incorrect because they do not address the specific issue of whether the foundation was laid or not.",
