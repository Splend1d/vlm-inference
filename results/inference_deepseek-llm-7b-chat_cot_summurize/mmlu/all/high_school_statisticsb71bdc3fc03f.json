It is closely related to the concept of the normal distribution, which is a symmetric and continuous probability distribution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the sampling distribution of the sample mean is not necessarily close to the normal distribution if both the original population has a normal distribution and n is large. The sampling distribution of the sample mean can be normal even if the original population has a non-normal distribution, as long as n is large enough.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the standard deviation of the original population is not a necessary condition for the sampling distribution of the sample mean to be close to the normal distribution. The sampling distribution of the sample mean is determined by the size of the sample (n) and the population from which the sample is drawn, not just the standard deviation of the original population.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the value of n and the distribution of the original population both play a role in determining the sampling distribution of the sample mean. While a larger sample size can help the sampling distribution of the sample mean to be closer to the normal distribution, the distribution of the original population also affects the shape of the sampling distribution.\n\nOption C is correct because the sampling distribution of the sample mean is close to the normal distribution if n is large, regardless of the distribution of the original population. This is because as n increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes more concentrated around the population mean, and the spread of the distribution narrows. This creates the appearance of a normal distribution.",
