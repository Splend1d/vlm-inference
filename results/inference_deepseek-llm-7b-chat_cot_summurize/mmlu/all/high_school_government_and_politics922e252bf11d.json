People holding advanced academic degrees\nB. Northeastern city dwellers\nC. Southerners\nD. Jewish Americans\n\nassistant:The Democratic Party has historically been associated with various social policies, which have sometimes divided its traditional bases. However, the most significant split in the party's history was between the Northern urban industrial working class and the Democratic Party's Southern \"Solid South\" coalition.\n\nThe Democratic Party's shift towards liberal social policies in the 1960s and 1970s, which included civil rights legislation, integration of public schools, and opposition to racial segregation, alienated its traditional Southern base. The Democratic Party had been the dominant political party in the South since the Reconstruction Era, and the party's shift towards liberal social policies undermined the interests of the old white power structure in the region.\n\nThe Democratic Party's liberal social policies also alienated some of its Northern urban industrial working-class base, who felt that the party was not adequately protecting their interests. For example, when President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed for the Great Society programs in the mid-1960s, some of his Northern urban industrial base felt that these programs were not focused enough on improving the lives of working-class Americans.\n\nTherefore, it is most likely that when the Democratic Party pursues liberal social policies, it is most likely to alienate the Southerners as their traditional base.",
