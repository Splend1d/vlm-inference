First, we need to determine the total number of electric cars in the United States. Second, we need to find out how much energy is required to charge each electric car fully. Third, we need to calculate the average energy consumption per mile for electric cars. Finally, we need to multiply these three factors to find the total energy required to power all electric cars in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Union of Concerned Scientists, there were approximately 28.7 million electric cars in the United States as of 2020. Assuming that the average electric car can travel 250 miles on a single charge, we need to find the total energy consumption for these vehicles. The energy consumption per mile for electric cars is approximately 135 watt-hours per mile. Multiplying these values, we find that the energy required to charge each electric car fully is approximately 3.4 kWh (28.7 million cars x 250 miles/car x 135 watt-hours/mile/kWh).\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy required to power all electric cars in the United States. To do this, we can multiply the energy required to charge each electric car fully by the total number of electric cars. This gives us 9.89 terawatt-hours (3.4 kWh/car x 28.7 million cars x 10^12 watt-hours/twh).\n\nFinally, we can multiply the energy consumption for electric cars by the energy consumption per mile for internal combustion engines to find the total energy required for both types of vehicles. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average energy consumption per mile for internal combustion vehicles is approximately 110 watt-hours per mile. Multiplying these values, we find that the total energy required to power all vehicles in the United States is approximately 9.89 terawatt-hours x 110 watt-hours/mile x 10^12 watt-hours/twh = 1.18 x 10^23 watt-hours.\n\nConverting this value to joules, we find that the United States will need approximately 2 x 10^23 joules of energy to generate if everyone drives electric cars.",
