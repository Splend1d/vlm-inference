During middle and high school, the parents are more typically described as\n\nA. partners\nB. collaborators\nC. supporters\nD. audience\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. supporters. During middle and high school, parents are more typically described as supporters of their children's education, rather than being involved as partners or collaborators. They may still be involved in their children's education, but their role may change from being actively involved in the child's learning to providing support and guidance. They may attend parent-teacher conferences, help with homework, and offer emotional support to their children.",
