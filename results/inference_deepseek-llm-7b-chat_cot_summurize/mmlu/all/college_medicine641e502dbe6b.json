According to his data, this hormone is found both inside and out of cells when carrying out its function, increase the amount of nucleic acid in the cell while functioning, and are derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. This will likely be categorized as which type of hormone?\n\nA. Enzymatic\nB. Steroid\nC. Peptide\nD. Amino acid\n\nassistant:The scientist has described a hormone that is found both inside and outside of cells, increases nucleic acid in the cell, and is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. Based on these characteristics, it is likely that this hormone is a steroid hormone.\n\nSteroid hormones are lipid-soluble hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex and the outer layer of the adrenal medulla, as well as in the gonads (ovaries and testes). They are transported in the bloodstream and can be stored in fatty tissues. They are able to pass through the cell membrane and bind to specific receptors on the target cells, which leads to the activation of specific proteins and the regulation of various physiological processes.\n\nSteroid hormones can be further classified into two main types: glucocorticoids and sex steroids. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are involved in regulating metabolism, immune function, and stress response. Sex steroids, such as testosterone and estrogen, are involved in regulating reproductive function, as well as various other physiological processes.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the scientist, it is likely that the new hormone discovered is a steroid hormone. The answer is B. Steroid.",
