Historical cost.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the financial statements of employee benefit pension plans and trusts, the plan investments are reported at historical cost. Historical cost is the original cost of an asset, such as an investment, as of a specific date. This method of reporting is used to ensure consistency and comparability of financial statements over time.\n\nA. Fair value is not used because it is not an accounting standard for reporting plan investments.\nC. Net realizable value is not used because it refers to the amount that can be received from an asset, such as a sale, and is not applicable to plan investments.\nD. Lower of historical cost or market is not used because it is an alternative method of reporting plan investments, but it is not a standard accounting practice for pension plans and trusts.",
