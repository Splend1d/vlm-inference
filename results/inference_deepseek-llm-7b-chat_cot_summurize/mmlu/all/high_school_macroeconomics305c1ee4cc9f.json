The CPI (Consumer Price Index) is a measure of the average change in prices over a period of time.\n2. The initial CPI value is 120.\n3. The new CPI value is 150.\n\nNow let's calculate the percentage change in CPI:\n\nPercentage change = (New CPI value - Initial CPI value) / Initial CPI value * 100\nPercentage change = (150 - 120) / 120 * 100\nPercentage change = 30 / 120 * 100\nPercentage change = 0.25 * 100\nPercentage change = 25\n\nSince the percentage change is 25, the prices have risen 25 percent. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.",
