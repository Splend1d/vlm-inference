Developments in religious art\n\nassistant:Urban II's discussion of Jerusalem in the third paragraph is best understood in the context of A. Pilgrimages to centers of religious significance. In the passage, Urban II calls upon the Christians to avenge the wrongs committed against the Christians and recover the territory from the Persians, who have invaded the lands and destroyed churches, kidnapped, and tortured the Christians. He urges the knights to remember the valor of their ancestors and recall the deeds of King Charles the Great and his son Louis, who destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans and extended the territory of the holy church. He also emphasizes the importance of the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is held captive by the unclean nations, and the holy places that are treated with ignominy and pollution.\n\nUrban II's speech was given at the Council of Clermont in 1095, in response to the Byzantine Emperor's request for assistance against the invading Turks. Urban II saw this as an opportunity to not only help the Byzantine Empire but also to encourage Christian knights to undertake a religious crusade to Jerusalem, which was considered a pilgrimage to a center of religious significance.\n\nTherefore, the context in which Urban II's discussion of Jerusalem should be understood is the call to embark on a religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem to free it from the hands of its enemies and restore it to its rightful place as a holy city. This call would later be known as the First Crusade, which led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and laid the foundation for subsequent crusades.",
