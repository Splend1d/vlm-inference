U.S. settlers were the first to arrive in the region; they claimed it for their country.\nD. Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.\n\nassistant:The United States took possession of the Oregon Territory through a combination of factors. The Oregon Territory, which included present-day Oregon, Washington, and parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, was initially claimed by both the United States and Britain. The United States settlers were the first to arrive in the region, and they claimed it for their country. However, the exact boundaries of the territory were not clear, leading to disputes between the two nations.\n\nIn 1818, the United States and Britain signed the Oregon Treaty, which established a joint occupation of the region and a boundary that would be settled later. Over the next few decades, the United States and Britain continued to dispute the boundary, with the Oregon Territory remaining in a state of ambiguity.\n\nIn 1846, the United States and Britain signed the Treaty of Oregon, which definitively settled the boundary dispute and provided for the cession of the Oregon Territory to the United States. Under the terms of the treaty, Britain agreed to cede the territory to the United States in exchange for the United States recognizing British sovereignty over the Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands.\n\nThus, the correct answer to the question is D. Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",
