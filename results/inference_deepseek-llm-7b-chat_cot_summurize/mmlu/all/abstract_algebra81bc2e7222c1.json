Statement 2 | If a belongs to a finite group then |a| divides |G|.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: If a finite group has order n then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n. This statement is true. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, if a group G has order n, then G can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In particular, G has subgroups of orders d for every positive divisor d of n.\n\nStatement 2: If a belongs to a finite group then |a| divides |G|. This statement is also true. Since the order of a group element a is defined as the smallest positive integer m such that a^m = e (where e is the identity element), and the order of the group G is the product of the orders of its elements, it follows that the order of a divides the order of G.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A.
