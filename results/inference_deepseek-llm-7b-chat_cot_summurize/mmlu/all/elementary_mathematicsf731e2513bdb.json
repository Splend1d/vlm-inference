In this case, we are looking for the GCF of 42 and 84.\n\nTo find the GCF, we can list the factors of each number:\n\n42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42\n84: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84\n\nThe common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42. The largest of these common factors is 42.\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 42 and 84 is 42.\n\nThe answer is: C",
