This is because consequentialist theories of punishment focus on the outcomes or consequences of an action, rather than the intentions or motivations behind the action. In the case of self-defense, the outcome is that the person is prevented from harming themselves or others.\n\nFrom a consequentialist perspective, the goal is to maximize overall well-being or happiness, and if killing in self-defense prevents harm and maximizes overall well-being, then it is a justifiable action. This is in contrast to deontological theories of punishment, which focus on the inherent wrongness of certain actions regardless of their consequences.\n\nTherefore, Nathanson's argument is most closely aligned with a consequentialist theory of punishment.",
