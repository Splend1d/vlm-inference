This principle is often associated with the concept of utilitarianism, which holds that the morally right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. The other options do not directly relate to the practical aim of moral theory. Parsimony refers to the principle of simplicity or avoiding unnecessary complexity, and explanatory power refers to the ability of a theory or model to explain phenomena. Neither of these concepts is directly connected to the practical aim of moral theory.",
