The control group should receive a treatment opposite to that given to the experimental group in order to determine the effect of the experimental treatment. If the control group receives the same treatment as the experimental group, it would be difficult to determine the effect of the experimental treatment since both groups are receiving the same treatment. Similarly, if the control group receives a different treatment from the experimental group, it would also be difficult to determine the effect of the experimental treatment since the control group is not receiving the same treatment as the experimental group. Therefore, the control group should receive a treatment opposite to that given to the experimental group in order to accurately compare the effects of the experimental treatment.\n\nB is incorrect because the control group should not receive the treatment under examination, but rather a treatment opposite to that given to the experimental group.\nC is incorrect because the control group should receive a treatment opposite to that given to the experimental group, not the same treatment.\nD is incorrect because the control group should not receive a random decision on receiving the treatment under examination, but rather a treatment opposite to that given to the experimental group.",
