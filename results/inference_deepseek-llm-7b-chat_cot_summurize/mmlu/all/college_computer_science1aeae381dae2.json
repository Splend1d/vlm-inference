C1: (0,0), C2: (48,48), C3: (35,35)\n\nassistant:To compute the cluster centers, we need to calculate the average of all the points within each cluster. For each cluster, we find the sum of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of all the points in the cluster, and then divide by the total number of points in the cluster.\n\nFor cluster C1, we have 2 points: {(0,6), (6,0)}. The sum of x-coordinates is 0 + 6 = 6, and the sum of y-coordinates is 6 + 0 = 6. The total number of points in cluster C1 is 2. So, the cluster center for C1 is (6/2, 6/2) = (3, 3).\n\nFor cluster C2, we have 3 points: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)}. The sum of x-coordinates is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12, and the sum of y-coordinates is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. The total number of points in cluster C2 is 3. So, the cluster center for C2 is (12/3, 12/3) = (4, 4).\n\nFor cluster C3, we have 2 points: {(5,5), (7,7)}. The sum of x-coordinates is 5 + 7 = 12, and the sum of y-coordinates is 5 + 7 = 12. The total number of points in cluster C3 is 2. So, the cluster center for C3 is (12/2, 12/2) = (6, 6).\n\nTherefore, the cluster centers computed for these 3 clusters are C1: (3, 3), C2: (4, 4), C3: (6, 6). The answer is B.",
