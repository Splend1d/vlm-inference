The muscle fibre is composed of many sarcomeres, which are the basic units of contractile activity in muscle tissue. The sarcomere consists of a thin filament (actin) and a thick filament (myosin), which work together to generate the force needed for muscle contraction. The myofibril is a structural unit within the muscle fibre, composed of multiple sarcomeres, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a cellular structure that helps regulate the calcium levels within the muscle cell.",
