The mean height of adult women is 66 inches, with a standard deviation of three inches.

The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men.\n\nassistant:To determine who is more unusually tall within their respective sex, we can calculate the z-scores for the man and the woman's heights.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviations for both men and women.\nMean height of men = 70 inches\nStandard deviation of men = 4 inches\nMean height of women = 66 inches\nStandard deviation of women = 3 inches\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-scores for the man and woman's heights.\nz-score for the man's height = (74 - 70) / (4 / sqrt(2)) = 4 / (4 / 2) = 4 / 2 = 2\nz-score for the woman's height = (70 - 66) / (3 / sqrt(2)) = 4 / (3 / 2) = 4 / 3 = 4/3 \u2248 1.33\n\nNow, we can compare the z-scores to determine who is more unusually tall.\nz-score for the man = 2\nz-score for the woman = 1.33\n\nThe man's z-score is greater than the woman's z-score, so the man is more unusually tall within his respective sex.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The man, because he is 74 inches tall and the woman is only 70 inches tall.",
