Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\nD. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1\n\nassistant:The most appropriate next step in treatment for the 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis who has not responded to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sulfasalazine treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).\n\nTNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammation and pain associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 with a biologic drug, such as infliximab, adalimumab, or certolizumab, can help reduce inflammation and pain in patients with this condition.\n\nCytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is involved in cell growth and proliferation but does not play a significant role in the inflammation or pain associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, but its inhibition has not been shown to be effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in treatment is to administer a drug that inhibits Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).",
