Because they regard empiricism as a more reliable method by which to understand the concept of law.\nB. Because they have no interest in the operation of the legal system.\nC. Because their approach is based on Bentham's sceptical account of the common law.\nD. Because they prefer a natural law analysis of legal ideas.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Because they regard empiricism as a more reliable method by which to understand the concept of law.\n\nScandinavian realists, who are a group of legal philosophers, reject a metaphysical approach to law because they believe that it is not an effective way to understand the concept of law. Instead, they prefer to use empirical methods, which involve collecting data and analyzing it to understand the concept of law. They believe that this method is more reliable and provides a better understanding of the legal system.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Scandinavian realists do have an interest in the operation of the legal system. They are simply not convinced that a metaphysical approach is the best way to understand it.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Scandinavian realists do not base their approach on Bentham's sceptical account of the common law. Bentham was an 18th-century philosopher and jurist who advocated for a utilitarian approach to law, which is different from the Scandinavian realists' approach.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Scandinavian realists do not prefer a natural law analysis of legal ideas. Natural law is a philosophical concept that holds that there are certain moral and ethical principles that are inherent in nature and that should govern human behavior. Scandinavian realists do not believe in natural law, instead they focus on empirical methods to understand the legal system.\n\nIn conclusion, Scandinavian realists reject a metaphysical approach to law because they believe that it is not an effective way to understand the concept of law. They prefer to use empirical methods, which involve collecting data and analyzing it to understand the legal system.",
