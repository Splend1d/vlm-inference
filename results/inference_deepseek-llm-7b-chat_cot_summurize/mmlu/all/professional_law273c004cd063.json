General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of \"willingly and knowingly\" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it.

No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n\nassistant:The federal appellate court is unlikely to reverse the conviction. The willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime, which the owner did not have in this case. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is not a defense, and the owner's main defense was that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to uphold the conviction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.",
