Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is an attorney who doesn't care about their clients' wealth. This behavior is morally wrong because it suggests that they are prioritizing their clients' wealth over providing fair and ethical representation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character takes hotel robes and towels as souvenirs. While this behavior is morally questionable, it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
