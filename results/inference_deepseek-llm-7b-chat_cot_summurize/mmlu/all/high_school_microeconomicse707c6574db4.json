The demand curve will shift to the left, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.\nB. The supply curve will shift to the left, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\nC. The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\nD. The supply curve will shift to the right, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The demand curve will shift to the left, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nWhen consumers are informed that multigrained bread can substantially lessen the risk of cancer, they will likely increase their demand for multigrained bread. This increase in demand will cause the demand curve to shift to the left, as shown below:\n\nBefore the information is released:\n\nAfter the information is released:\n\nAs the demand curve shifts to the left, the market price of multigrained bread will decrease, as the new equilibrium price is at point B', which is lower than the original equilibrium price at point B.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The supply curve will shift to the left, increasing the price of multigrained bread. This is incorrect because the demand curve is the one that shifts when new information is released. The supply curve remains unchanged.\n\nC. The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread. This is incorrect because it contradicts the initial statement that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer. A shift to the right would mean that the demand for multigrained bread decreases, not increases.\n\nD. The supply curve will shift to the right, decreasing the price of multigrained bread. This is incorrect because the supply curve remains unchanged.",
