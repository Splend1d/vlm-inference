This act can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 because it involves showing off and potentially making the homeless person feel bad about their situation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character wakes up at 4 AM to make a smoothie for themselves. This act is not morally wrong as it does not involve any harmful or selfish behavior towards others.",
