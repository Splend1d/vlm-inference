RNA.\n\nThe nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing genetic information in the form of DNA. The DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is used to create proteins. Proteins are essential for many cellular functions, and are produced through the process of protein synthesis. Therefore, the cell nucleus contains all three of these components, making option D the correct answer.",
