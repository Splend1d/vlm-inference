Raising the required reserve ratio\n\nassistant:The Federal Reserve implements an expansionary policy by doing A. Buying Treasury bonds in the open market.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy is aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing unemployment. One of the tools the Federal Reserve uses to implement expansionary policy is open market operations, which involve buying and selling government securities in the open market. By buying Treasury bonds in the open market, the Federal Reserve increases the money supply, which in turn lowers interest rates and makes borrowing cheaper. This encourages borrowing and investment, leading to increased economic activity and growth.\n\nRaising the federal funds rate, raising the discount rate, and raising the required reserve ratio are contractionary policy tools that the Federal Reserve uses to control inflation and stabilize the economy.",
