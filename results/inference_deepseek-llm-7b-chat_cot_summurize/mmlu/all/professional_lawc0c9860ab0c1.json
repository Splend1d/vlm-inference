This argument is relevant because it directly addresses the allegation that the new law is unconstitutional. The attorney's possible argument is that the new law is unconstitutional because it deprives the staff assistant of his pension benefits without providing due process of law.\n\nBy arguing that the implicit condition of not engaging in bribery was a part of the employment contract, the state can counter this argument. This is because the staff assistant's conviction for bribery is a breach of this implicit condition, and therefore the discontinuance of pension benefits is not a deprivation of rights without due process of law. In other words, the state can argue that the staff assistant's pension benefits were not automatically forfeited by the mere fact of his conviction, but rather by the specific violation of the employment contract.\n\nTherefore, the state's best rebuttal would be that it is implicit that one of the conditions of the state's contract of employment with a state agency staff member is that he shall not engage in bribery. This argument provides a lawful basis for the discontinuance of the staff assistant's pension benefits, and counters the attorney's argument that the new law is unconstitutional.",
