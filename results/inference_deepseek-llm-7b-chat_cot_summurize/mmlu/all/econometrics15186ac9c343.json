(ii) and (iv) only\nB. (i) and (iii) only\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nassistant:(i) Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion\nAkaike's information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's information criterion (SIC) are both commonly used information criteria in model selection. Adjusted R-squared is a measure of the goodness-of-fit of a regression model and is used to evaluate the quality of the model. While it is not an information criterion in the strict sense, as it does not provide a measure of the relative quality of different models, it can be used as a supplementary criterion to help guide model selection.\n\n(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall\nThis statement is true for both AIC and SIC. When an additional term is added to the model, the residual sum of squares will generally decrease. This means that the model will fit the data better and the value of the information criterion (e.g., AIC) will decrease.\n\n(iii) Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While AIC and SIC are similar in many respects, AIC is generally considered to select models with higher order than SIC. However, this does not always hold, and there may be cases where SIC selects a model with a lower order than AIC.\n\n(iv) Akaike's information criterion is consistent\nThis statement is true. AIC is a consistent estimator of the true model order, meaning that as the sample size increases, the true model order will be selected with increasing probability.\n\nTherefore, statements (i), (ii), and (iv) are true concerning information criteria.
