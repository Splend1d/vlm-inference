Personality\nB. Working memory\nC. Female hormone levels\nD. Male sexuality\n\nassistant:A discontinuous change over the adult years is a change that occurs abruptly or suddenly, rather than gradually over time. One example of this is the change in male sexuality. Male sexuality is often thought of as a stable and consistent aspect of a person's identity, but in reality, it can undergo sudden and unexpected changes throughout a person's life. These changes may be due to a variety of factors, such as changes in the brain, hormonal fluctuations, or changes in a person's relationships or social environment.\n\nIt is important to note that while some changes in male sexuality may be discontinuous, many changes are gradual and occur over time. Additionally, it is important to remember that everyone's experience of sexuality is unique and may vary significantly from person to person.",
