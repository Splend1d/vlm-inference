Upon being taken into custody, he was given his Miranda rights and then taken to the police station for booking. At the stationhouse, the man told a police officer that he was prepared to make a confession. The police officer then turned on a video recorder and videotaped the man's confession. At trial, the prosecution called the police officer to testify to the incriminating statements that the man made in his confession. Upon objection by the man's attorney, the police officer's proposed testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nC. admissible, because the police officer had firsthand knowledge of the confession.\nD. admissible, because the man was given his Miranda rights before the confession was elicited.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession. The prosecution is not allowed to rely on the officer's testimony to present the contents of the confession to the jury. The best evidence rule requires that the original evidence be used if it is available, and in this case, the original evidence is the videotape of the confession.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the police officer's testimony is not hearsay. Hearsay is a statement that is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The officer's testimony would be about what the man said in the confession, not about what the officer heard from someone else.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the police officer did not actually make the confession. The man's attorney would argue that the officer did not have firsthand knowledge of the confession and therefore his testimony should be excluded.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the man's Miranda rights do not affect the admissibility of the confession. The admissibility of a confession is based on the voluntariness of the confession, not whether the person was read their rights.",
