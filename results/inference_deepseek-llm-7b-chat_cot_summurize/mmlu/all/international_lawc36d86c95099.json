The ECHR applies extraterritorially where a member State has contributed forces to a UN peacekeeping mission\nD. The ECHR applies extraterritorially where human rights violations are taking place in former colonies of member States\n\nassistant:The ECHR, or European Convention on Human Rights, is a treaty that sets out the rights and freedoms that individuals are entitled to in Europe. The ECHR applies to the member States of the Council of Europe, which is a regional organization that promotes human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe.\n\nHowever, the ECHR does not apply to non-member States, including those outside of Europe. In some circumstances, the ECHR may apply extraterritorially, which means that it applies to actions taken by a member State outside of its own territory. This typically occurs when a member State has effective control over the territory where the human rights violation is taking place, or when the violation is connected to a situation that has a connection to the territory of the member State.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The ECHR applies extraterritorially in circumstances where a member State exercises effective control.",
