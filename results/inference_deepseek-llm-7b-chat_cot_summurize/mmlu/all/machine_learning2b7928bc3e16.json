It involves dividing the dataset into K equal-sized folds, training the model on K-1 folds and testing it on the remaining fold, and repeating this process K times. The average performance of the model across all folds is then calculated.\n\nIn terms of the number of iterations, K-fold cross-validation is linear in K, as the process is repeated K times. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. linear in K",
