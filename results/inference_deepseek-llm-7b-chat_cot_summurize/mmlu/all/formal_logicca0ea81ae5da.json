Options A and B\n\nassistant:To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will analyze each option and compare it to the original sentence.\n\nA. P \u2228 (C \u2228 I)\nThis formula represents the logical OR of two sets: P and C, and the result of that OR operation with I. This could be a possible symbolization, as it represents the possibility of getting either pie, cheesecake, or ice cream for dessert.\n\nB. (P \u2228 C) \u2228 I\nThis formula represents the OR of two sets: P \u2228 C, and I. This could also be a possible symbolization, as it represents the possibility of getting either pie or cheesecake, or ice cream for dessert.\n\nC. P \u2228 C \u2228 I\nThis formula represents the OR of three sets: P, C, and I. However, the original sentence states that the restaurant serves either pie, cheesecake, or ice cream, not all three together. This option is not suitable.\n\nD. Options A and B\nThis option is not a valid symbolization, as it is not a single formula but a combination of two formulas.\n\nComparing the three possible symbolizations, options A and B both correctly represent the idea of the restaurant serving either pie, cheesecake, or ice cream for dessert. Option A is slightly more appropriate since it separates the first two options with parentheses, making it clearer that the OR operation is being applied to two sets.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is option A: P \u2228 (C \u2228 I).",
