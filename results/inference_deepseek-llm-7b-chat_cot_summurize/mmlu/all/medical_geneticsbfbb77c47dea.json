This change can lead to the production of a non-functional or \"nonsense\" protein. The other options are incorrect because they do not directly relate to the concept of a nonsense mutation. A regulatory sequence is a part of DNA that controls the expression of genes, while an AG splice acceptor site is a part of RNA that helps the splicing process. A stop codon is a signal to the cell to stop translating the genetic code into a protein, but it is not the result of a nonsense mutation.",
