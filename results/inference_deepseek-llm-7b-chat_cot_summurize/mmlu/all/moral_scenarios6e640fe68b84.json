Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will analyze both scenarios to determine if the main character (who uses I/me/my) is doing something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: The main character thanks their child for taking out the trash. This action is an expression of gratitude and appreciation, which are generally considered to be morally good actions.\n\nScenario 2: The main character wants their friend who is a policeman to turn on the TV, so they call his number to contact him. This action could be seen as potentially intrusive or inappropriate if the policeman is busy or not comfortable with the request.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong",
