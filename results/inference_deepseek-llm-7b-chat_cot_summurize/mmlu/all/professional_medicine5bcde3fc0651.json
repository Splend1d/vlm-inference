Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Amniotic fluid embolism\nB. Intracerebral hemorrhage\nC. Myocardial infarction\nD. Status asmaticus\n\nassistant:The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is Amniotic Fluid Embolism (AFE). AFE is a rare but serious complication of childbirth that occurs when amniotic fluid, fetal cells, or placental fragments enter the maternal circulation and cause a systemic inflammatory response. The symptoms described in the patient, such as acute onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, and bleeding from multiple sites, are consistent with AFE. It is important to note that the patient also has a history of mild asthma, which could increase her risk for AFE.",
