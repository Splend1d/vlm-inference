The passage describes a moment when Clemenceau, a chief at a newspaper office, is asked about the reaction of Paris to the announcement of war. Clemenceau responds by saying \"It will be all right then,\" which implies that he believes the reaction of Paris to the news of war is a positive one, and that it will be beneficial for France. This suggests that Clemenceau would one day serve as prime minister of France, as he is shown to have a strong sense of leadership and belief in the positive impact of the war on France.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. would one day serve as prime minister of France.",
