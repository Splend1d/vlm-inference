At one instant, the particle\u2019s speed is 10 meters per second and is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second squared. The angle between the particle\u2019s velocity and acceleration vectors is\n\nA. 0\u00b0\nB. 30\u00b0\nC. 45\u00b0\nD. 60\u00b0\n\nassistant:We can use the formula for the angle between two vectors:\n\nangle = arccos((v dot v) / (||v|| ||a||))\n\nwhere v is the velocity vector, a is the acceleration vector, and ||v|| and ||a|| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n||v|| = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2) = sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10\u221a2 m/s\n||a|| = sqrt(a_x^2 + a_y^2) = sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10\u221a2 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the dot product of the vectors:\n\nv dot v = v_x * a_x + v_y * a_y = 10 * 10 + 10 * 10 = 200 m^2/s^2\n\nFinally, we can find the angle:\n\nangle = arccos((v dot v) / (||v|| ||a||)) = arccos(200 / (10\u221a2 * 10\u221a2)) \u2248 arccos(2) \u2248 60\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors is approximately 60\u00b0.
