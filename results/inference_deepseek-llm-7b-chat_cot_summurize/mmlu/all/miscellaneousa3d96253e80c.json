Granite\nB. Quartzite\nC. Schist\nD. Marble\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will consider the types of rocks and their metamorphic origins.\n\nA. Granite is a rock formed from the metamorphism of sandstone, not shale.\nB. Quartzite is a rock formed from the metamorphism of sandstone, but it is more likely to form from the metamorphism of shale.\nC. Schist is a rock formed from the metamorphism of shale.\nD. Marble is a rock formed from the metamorphism of limestone, not shale.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Quartzite, as it is most likely to form from the metamorphism of shale.",
