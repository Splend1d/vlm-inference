The parties entered into a collateral oral agreement for the replacement of the worn belt that was excludable from the integrated writing.\n\nassistant:A. The writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.\n\nThe most likely cause for the court ruling in favor of the mechanic is that the writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement. This means that the written contract was considered to be a complete and final statement of all the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties, and any oral agreements made before or after the contract was formed were excluded from the contract.\n\nIn this case, the parties orally agreed that if any additional servicing was needed above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. However, since the written contract was considered a complete integration of the parties' agreement, this oral agreement was not included in the contract and was therefore not binding. As a result, the mechanic could not charge the woman an additional $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, as he had done without her consent.",
