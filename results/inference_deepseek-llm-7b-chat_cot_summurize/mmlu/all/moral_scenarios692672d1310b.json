Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character does something that is morally wrong. They intentionally style their hair to show up their stepmom, who is going through chemotherapy and has lost her hair. This is an act of cruelty and lack of empathy towards someone who is already suffering.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is not doing anything clearly morally wrong. They are keeping their friend's crush a secret, which is a private matter and not harmful to anyone.",
