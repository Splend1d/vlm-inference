Which of the following must be true?\n\nA. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\nB. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\nC. The total work done during the cycle is positive.\nD. The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n\nDuring an isobaric process, the gas is subjected to a change in pressure while the volume remains constant. The work done by the gas on the surroundings is equal to the change in internal energy of the gas. Therefore, the change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the change in internal energy of the gas is not equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the total work done during the cycle is not necessarily positive or negative. It depends on the specific process and the direction of the process.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred. This is a property of the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the total change in internal energy (\u0394U) of a system is equal to the sum of the work done on the system (W) and the heat transferred to the system (Q). In this case, the net amount of heat transferred is equal to the difference between the work done during the isobaric step and the work done during the isothermal step.",
