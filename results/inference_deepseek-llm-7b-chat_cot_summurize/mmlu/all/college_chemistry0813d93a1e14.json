Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nassistant:Let's analyze each option to determine which one is a true statement about optical isomerism of complexes containing achiral ligands.\n\nA. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is false. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if the ligands are different. The geometry of the complex determines whether optical isomerism occurs, not the ligands themselves.\n\nB. Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is false. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism. The tetrahedral complex of [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 is a well-known example of a complex that displays optical isomerism.\n\nC. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is true. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different. The different ligands can have different chiral centers, and these chiral centers can interact with each other, leading to optical isomerism.\n\nD. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is false. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism even if they have only two different ligands. The geometry of the complex determines whether optical isomerism occurs, not the number of different ligands.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.",
