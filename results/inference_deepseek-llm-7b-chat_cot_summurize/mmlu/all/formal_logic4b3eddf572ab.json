H \u2228 R\n\nassistant:To determine the best symbolization for the given sentence, let's first break down the sentence into its main components and relationships.\n\n1. Doctors (H) are helpful (\u2261).\n2. Their patients (R) are rude (\u00ac).\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\nA. H \u2261 R: This formula represents the first component of the sentence, stating that doctors are helpful. However, it does not account for the second component, which states that their patients are not helpful (since they are rude).\n\nB. H \u2022 R: This formula represents the conjunction (AND) of the two components of the sentence. However, it does not clearly convey the meaning that doctors are helpful unless their patients are not rude.\n\nC. H \u2228 ~R: This formula represents the disjunction (OR) of the two components of the sentence. It clearly states that doctors are helpful unless their patients are not rude. This is the best symbolization for the given sentence.\n\nD. H \u2228 R: This formula represents the conjunction (OR) of the two components of the sentence. However, it does not clearly convey the meaning that doctors are helpful unless their patients are not rude.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization for the given sentence is option C: H \u2228 ~R.",
