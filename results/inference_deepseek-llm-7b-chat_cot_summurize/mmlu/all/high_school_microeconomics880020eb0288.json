Progressive\nB. Proportional\nC. Regressive\nD. Neutral\n\nassistant:A sales tax on food would fall into the category of a regressive tax.\n\nRegressive taxes are those that impose a greater burden on people with lower incomes, who spend a larger percentage of their income on the taxed goods or services. In this case, people with relatively low incomes spend a larger percentage of their income on food, so a sales tax on food would disproportionately impact them, making it a regressive tax.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Regressive.",
