Declaration of Independence.\n\nassistant:Susan B. Anthony was not basing her appeal for women's equality on any of the documents listed. Instead, her appeals for women's equality were made through her speeches, writings, and activism throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of her key works include \"An Appeal to the Ladies\" (1869), \"The Woman's Bible\" (1898), and \"The History of Woman Suffrage\" (1881-1922).\n\nSusan B. Anthony and other suffragists fought for women's right to vote through various means, including lobbying, organizing, and campaigning for women's suffrage. Their efforts culminated in the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote in 1920.\n\nIt is important to note that the documents listed (Articles of Confederation, Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, Compromise of 1850, and Declaration of Independence) do not pertain to Susan B. Anthony's appeals for women's equality. They are all significant historical documents in their own right, but they are not related to her work for women's rights.",
