It is possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers C which make (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) an ordered field.\n\nThis is because the set of complex numbers with absolute value less than 1 forms a linear order under the usual absolute value, and this linear order can be extended to a linear order on all of C by considering the real and imaginary parts separately.",
