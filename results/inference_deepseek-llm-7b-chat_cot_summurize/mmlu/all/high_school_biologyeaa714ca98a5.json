Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and ribosomes:\n- Peroxisomes can catalyze reactions involving hydrogen peroxide.\n- Mitochondria provide cellular energy through cellular respiration.\n- Ribosomes make proteins.\n\nB. Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and lysosomes:\n- Peroxisomes can catalyze reactions involving hydrogen peroxide.\n- Mitochondria provide cellular energy through cellular respiration.\n- Lysosomes are involved in digestion and breaking down waste, but they are not involved in making proteins.\n\nC. Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus:\n- Peroxisomes can catalyze reactions involving hydrogen peroxide.\n- Mitochondria provide cellular energy through cellular respiration.\n- The Golgi apparatus is involved in processing and modifying proteins, but it is not involved in making proteins.\n\nD. Lysosomes, chloroplasts, and ribosomes:\n- Lysosomes are involved in digestion and breaking down waste, but they are not involved in catalyzing reactions involving hydrogen peroxide, providing cellular energy, or making proteins.\n- Chloroplasts are involved in photosynthesis, not providing cellular energy.\n- Ribosomes make proteins.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and ribosomes, as it contains all the components needed to perform the three tasks mentioned.",
