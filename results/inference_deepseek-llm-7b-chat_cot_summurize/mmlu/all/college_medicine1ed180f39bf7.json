In a female, the sex chromosomes are XX, while in a male, they are XY. When a female (XX) and a male (XY) conceive a child, the child will receive one X chromosome from the mother and one from the father. If the child receives two X chromosomes (XX), they will be female, and if they receive one X and one Y chromosome (XY), they will be male. The number of X chromosomes inherited from the mother determines the sex of the child.",
