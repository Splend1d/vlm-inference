An option contract was created, because the contractor used the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city and notified the insulation company of that fact.\n\nassistant:The contractor is entitled to claim $5,000 against the insulation company because the insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants. This is because, when the contractor used the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city, it created an option contract with the insulation company. The insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants. Therefore, the contractor is entitled to claim $5,000 against the insulation company for breaching the option contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city.",
