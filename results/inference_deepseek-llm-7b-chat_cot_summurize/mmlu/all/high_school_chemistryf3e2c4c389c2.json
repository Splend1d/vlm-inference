F + NO2 \u2192 NO2F Fast step. What is the order of the overall reaction?\n\nA. Zero order\nB. First order\nC. Second order\nD. Third order\n\nassistant:To determine the order of the overall reaction, we can use the concept of Le Chatelier's principle. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure, it will adjust its equilibrium position to minimize the effect of the change.\n\nIn this case, we can assume that the forward reaction is the slow step, and the reverse reaction is the fast step. We can apply Le Chatelier's principle to the slow step reaction:\n\nF + NO2 \u2192 NO2F\n\nIf we increase the concentration of F, the equilibrium will shift to the right, meaning more NO2F will be produced. Conversely, if we decrease the concentration of F, the equilibrium will shift to the left, meaning less NO2F will be produced.\n\nNow, let's apply Le Chatelier's principle to the fast step reaction:\n\nNO2F + F \u2192 NO2 + F2\n\nIf we increase the concentration of NO2F, the equilibrium will shift to the left, meaning less NO2 and F2 will be produced. Conversely, if we decrease the concentration of NO2F, the equilibrium will shift to the right, meaning more NO2 and F2 will be produced.\n\nSince the fast step reaction is not influenced by the concentration of the products, it can be ignored. Therefore, the order of the overall reaction is determined by the slow step reaction, which is a 1st-order reaction.\n\nThe answer is B. First order.",
