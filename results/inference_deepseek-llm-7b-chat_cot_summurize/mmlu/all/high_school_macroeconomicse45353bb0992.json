Always vertical in the long run.\nB. Always upward sloping because it follows the Law of Supply.\nC. Always horizontal.\nD. Always downward sloping.\n\nassistant:B. Always upward sloping because it follows the Law of Supply.\n\nThe AS curve in the long run is always upward sloping because it follows the Law of Supply. The Law of Supply states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied by producers will also increase, leading to an upward sloping AS curve. This is because producers are incentivized to supply more of a good or service when the price is high, and they have the resources and ability to do so.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. An upward sloping AS curve is not always vertical in the long run. The curve should be sloping upwards, not vertical.\n\nC. An upward sloping AS curve is not always horizontal. The curve should be sloping upwards, not horizontal.\n\nD. An upward sloping AS curve is not always downward sloping. The curve should be sloping upwards, not downward.",
