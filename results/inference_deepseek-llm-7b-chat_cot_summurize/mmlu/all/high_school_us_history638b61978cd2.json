Rights are granted by the government.\n\nassistant:Andrew Hamilton assumes that natural rights are real and exist, and that they are not granted by the government. This is because he mentions that \"free men claim\" a right to complain when they are hurt and to publicly remonstrate against abuses of power. He also says that \"liberty\" is one of the greatest blessings heaven can bestow, and that it is the cause of liberty. These statements suggest that Hamilton believes in the existence of natural rights, rather than rights being granted by the government.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Andrew Hamilton assumes that natural rights are merely ideas that don't really exist.",
