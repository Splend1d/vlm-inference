Scenario 1 | When my restaurant's freezer broke, I served the warm meat even though I knew it was very unsafe. Scenario 2 | I decided to start a fire in the forest.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The main character in the first scenario (Scenario 1) does something clearly morally wrong by serving warm meat even though the user knows it is very unsafe. This is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it endangers the health and well-being of the customers who consume it.\n\nThe main character in the second scenario (Scenario 2) starts a fire in the forest, which is morally wrong as well. This can lead to significant damage to the environment, harm to animals and plants, and potentially pose a risk to human safety. Starting a fire in a forest without permission is not only morally wrong, but it is also illegal in many places.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: Wrong, Wrong. Both scenarios involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
