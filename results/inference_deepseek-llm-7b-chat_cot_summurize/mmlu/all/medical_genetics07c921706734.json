Metaphase I.\nB. Prophase I.\nC. Metaphase II.\nD. Prophase II.\n\nassistant:In meiosis, recombination occurs in Metaphase I.\n\nHere's the step-by-step justification for my response:\n\n1. Meiosis is a type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms, producing gametes (sperm or egg cells) with half the normal number of chromosomes.\n\n2. There are two main stages in meiosis: meiosis I and meiosis II.\n\n3. Recombination occurs during the first meiotic prophase, which is a part of meiosis I.\n\n4. In meiosis, homologous chromosomes (chromosomes that pair up) exchange genetic material during prophase I. This process, called recombination, contributes to genetic variation in gametes and helps ensure that offspring inherit unique combinations of traits from their parents.\n\n5. Therefore, recombination occurs in Metaphase I, which is the first stage of meiosis I. The correct answer is A.",
