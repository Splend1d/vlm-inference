Both ResNets and Transformers are types of feedforward neural networks.\n\nStatement 2: The original Transformers use self-attention, but the original ResNet does not.\n- This statement is false. The original ResNet does use self-attention, as mentioned in the description of the model.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
