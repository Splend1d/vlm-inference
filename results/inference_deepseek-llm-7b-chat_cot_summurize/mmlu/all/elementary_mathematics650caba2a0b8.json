Max picked 187 strawberries. Jonathon picked 223 strawberries. Together they ate 26 of the strawberries. Which expression shows a way to find the total number of strawberries Max and Jonathon have left?\n\nA. 190 + 220 \u2013 30 + 4\nB. 185 + 225 \u2013 25 + 1\nC. 200 + 200 \u2013 30 \u2013 4\nD. 200 + 200 \u2013 25 \u2013 1\n\nassistant:To find the total number of strawberries Max and Jonathon have left, we should first find the total number of strawberries they picked, which is 187 + 223 = 410 strawberries. Next, we need to subtract the number of strawberries they ate, which is 26 strawberries. Therefore, the expression to represent the remaining strawberries is 410 - 26 = 384 strawberries.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given expressions to find the one that matches our calculation:\n\nA. 190 + 220 \u2013 30 + 4 = 360 - 30 + 4 = 334\nB. 185 + 225 \u2013 25 + 1 = 411 - 25 + 1 = 386\nC. 200 + 200 \u2013 30 \u2013 4 = 400 - 30 - 4 = 366\nD. 200 + 200 \u2013 25 \u2013 1 = 400 - 25 - 1 = 374\n\nThe correct answer is C. 200 + 200 \u2013 30 \u2013 4.",
