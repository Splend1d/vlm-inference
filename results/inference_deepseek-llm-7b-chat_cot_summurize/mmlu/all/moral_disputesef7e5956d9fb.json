None of the above\n\nassistant:On Pogge's view, affluent citizens are harming the poor by imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes. This is because Pogge argues that affluent citizens have a moral obligation to compensate for the harms they have caused to the poor through historical injustices. This compensation can take many forms, such as providing resources, education, and healthcare to the poor, or directly addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes.",
