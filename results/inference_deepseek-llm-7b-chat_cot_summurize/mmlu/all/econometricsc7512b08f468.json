(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nLet's go through each of the options:\n\ni) All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero: This is true if the value of $R^2$ is exactly zero. In that case, none of the coefficient estimates on the slopes will be statistically significant.\n\nii) The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables: This is true if the value of $R^2$ is exactly zero. In that case, the fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables because it will not explain any of the variability of y about its mean value.\n\niii) The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value: This is true if the value of $R^2$ is exactly zero. In that case, the regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value.\n\niv) The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero: This is not necessarily true. Even if the value of $R^2$ is exactly zero, the intercept coefficient estimate can be non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).",
