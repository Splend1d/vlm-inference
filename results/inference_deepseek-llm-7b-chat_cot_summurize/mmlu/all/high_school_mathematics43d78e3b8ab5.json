You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Given that a rectangle with length $3x$ inches and width $x + 5$ inches has the property that its area and perimeter have equal values, what is $x$?\n\nA. 1\nB. 5\nC. \\frac{10}{3}\nD. \\frac{3}{10}\n\nassistant:The area of the rectangle is $(3x)(x+5)$.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is $2(3x) + 2(x+5) = 6x + 10$.\nSince the area and perimeter have equal values, we have the equation:\n$(3x)(x+5) = 6x + 10$.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $3x^2 + 15x - 5 = 0$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get $x^2 + 5x - \\frac{5}{3} = 0$.\nFactoring, we get $(x+5)(x-\\frac{1}{3}) = 0$.\nSetting each factor equal to 0, we have $x+5=0$ or $x-\\frac{1}{3}=0$.\nSolving each equation, we find $x=5$ or $x=\\frac{10}{3}$.\nHowever, since the length of a rectangle cannot be a fraction of an inch, the only valid solution is $x=\\boxed{5}$.\nThe answer is: 5",
