This is an example of seasonal unemployment. Cyclical unemployment refers to a situation where the overall economy is experiencing a recession or depression, causing businesses to lay off workers. Discouraged workers are individuals who have stopped looking for work because they believe that they will not find a job, and frictional unemployment occurs when workers are transitioning between jobs. Seasonal unemployment, on the other hand, occurs when there is a temporary decrease in demand for a particular type of work due to changes in the seasons. In this case, the public swimming pool is closed for the winter, causing Theo to lose his job as a lifeguard.",
