Yes, the proposed testimony was not reliable in that it was based on scientific testing only and did not discuss medical science or rule out other causes.\nB. No, the testimony was admissible because several factors militated in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable, and thus helpful to the jury in determining the critical issue of causation.\nC.

No, the testimony was admissible because several factors militated in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable, and thus helpful to the jury in determining the critical issue of causation.\n\nThe expert's qualifications, experience, and publications in peer-reviewed journals demonstrate that he is well-versed in the research and development of drugs similar to the one at issue. His findings were also endorsed by other experts in the field, further supporting the reliability of his testimony. Additionally, the expert performed a differential diagnosis, conducted scientifically valid tests, and made calculations to support his conclusion that the drug was the cause of the baby's injuries. These factors all work in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable and helpful to the jury.",
