Always requires parenteral nutritional suport\nB. May follow colectomy\nC. Is always permanent\nD. May benefit from sodium supplementation of >=90mmol/l\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Intestinal failure always requires parenteral nutritional support.\n\nIntestinal failure is a condition where the intestines are unable to absorb nutrients properly. This can occur due to various reasons, such as surgery, infection, or injury. In this case, the intestines can no longer produce enough digestive enzymes, leading to malabsorption.\n\nTo compensate for the malabsorption, patients with intestinal failure require parenteral nutritional support. This means that they need to receive nutrients through an intravenous (IV) line, as their intestines are unable to absorb the nutrients from food or a tube. Parenteral nutritional support provides essential nutrients such as protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals that the body needs to function properly.\n\nOption B, which states that intestinal failure may follow colectomy, is not always true. Colectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a portion or the entire colon, and it is often done to treat conditions such as colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. However, the development of intestinal failure after colectomy depends on various factors, such as the extent of the surgery, the patient's overall health, and the presence of any underlying conditions.\n\nOption C, which states that intestinal failure is always permanent, is also not true. While it is true that some patients with intestinal failure may require lifelong parenteral nutritional support, some may eventually regain the ability to absorb nutrients through their intestines. This can happen with the help of medical therapies, such as intra-ileal diversion or intestinal rehabilitation, or through a successful surgical procedure.\n\nOption D, which states that intestinal failure may benefit from sodium supplementation of >=90mmol/l, is not entirely accurate either. Sodium supplementation may be necessary for some patients with intestinal failure, but the amount required depends on the patient's individual needs. In some cases, sodium supplementation may be beneficial, while in others, it may not be necessary or may even cause harm.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is A. Intestinal failure always requires parenteral nutritional support.",
