It does not seem to be true.\n\nThe phrase \"opposites attract\" is a common folk saying that suggests that people with different attitudes or qualities tend to be drawn to each other. However, research has shown that this may not be the case. In fact, studies have found that individuals are often drawn to partners who share similar attitudes, values, and interests.\n\nOne reason for this may be that people are more likely to find someone who shares their values and beliefs, which can lead to a stronger and more fulfilling relationship. Additionally, people with similar attitudes and interests tend to have more in common and may be more compatible in terms of communication and problem-solving skills.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there are exceptions to this rule. Some people may find that they are attracted to someone who has different attitudes or qualities than they do, and this can lead to a successful and fulfilling relationship.\n\nOverall, the saying \"opposites attract\" may not be true for everyone, but it is possible that it can happen in some cases. It is important to consider individual differences and the unique factors that contribute to attraction in each situation.",
