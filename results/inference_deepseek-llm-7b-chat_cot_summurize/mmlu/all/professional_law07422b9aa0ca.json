Prior screening and subsequent evidentiary hearing\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. Prior notice and opportunity to respond.\n\nTermination of a parent's custody rights and also termination of welfare benefits both require a process that gives the parent notice of the proposed termination and an opportunity to respond to the allegations or reasons for termination.\n\nA. Prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing is incorrect because it suggests that the parent would have to go through an evidentiary hearing before being given notice, which is not the standard process.\nC. Prior screening by neutral fact finder is incorrect because it suggests that there would be a neutral fact finder involved in the process before notice is given, which is not typically the case.\nD. Prior screening and subsequent evidentiary hearing is also incorrect because it suggests that there would be a screening process before an evidentiary hearing, which is not the standard process.",
