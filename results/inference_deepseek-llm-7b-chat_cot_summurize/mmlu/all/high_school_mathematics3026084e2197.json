In other words, the decimal representation does not continue infinitely.\n\nSince $n$ contains the digit 9, we can write $n$ as $9k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{9k}$ is a terminating decimal.\n\nTo do this, we can check the prime factorization of $\\frac{1}{9k}$.\n\nSince $9k = 36k$, we can write $\\frac{1}{9k} = \\frac{1}{36k}$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $\\frac{1}{36k}$ is $2^{-1} \\cdot 3^{-1} \\cdot 6^{-1}$, which is a terminating decimal.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ is $9k$, where $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that $\\frac{1}{36k}$ is a terminating decimal.\n\nSince $k$ is the smallest positive integer, the smallest value of $k$ is $1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $n$ is $9 \\cdot 1 = 9$, but since $9$ does not contain the digit 9, we need to increase $k$ by $1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ is $9 \\cdot 2 = 18$, which contains the digit 9.\n\nHowever, $18$ is not the smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
