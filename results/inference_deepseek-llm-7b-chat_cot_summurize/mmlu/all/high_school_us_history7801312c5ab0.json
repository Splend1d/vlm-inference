Large numbers of free blacks, unwelcome in the East, began to resettle in the West.\n\nassistant:The question is asking for a change in westward migration that occurred in the 1840s. The passage provided by the user is a quote from John L. O'Sullivan, an American journalist and political activist, who wrote about the idea of Manifest Destiny, which was the belief that Americans had a divine right to expand across North America. This belief was influential in shaping American westward expansion.\n\nOption A, \"The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased,\" aligns with the idea of Manifest Destiny. The passage speaks of a future where the nation will be \"destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles,\" and the mention of California in the passage suggests that it may have been seen as a place where these divine principles could be realized. Additionally, the passage does not mention the Oregon territory, which could explain why the number of pioneers headed there decreased.\n\nOption B, \"The first great wave of migration ended, and the number of migrants remained extremely low until after the Civil War,\" does not align with the passage provided, as it does not mention a decrease in migration.\n\nOption C, \"For the first time, pioneers began to settle areas west of the Mississippi River,\" does not align with the passage, as it does not mention the Mississippi River or the settling of pioneers.\n\nOption D, \"Large numbers of free blacks, unwelcome in the East, began to resettle in the West,\" does not align with the passage, as it does not mention free blacks or their migration to the West.\n\nTherefore, the change in westward migration most likely to have occurred in the 1840s is option A.",
