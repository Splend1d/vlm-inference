The case presents a nonjusticiable political question. This argument is based on the principle that certain issues are inherently political in nature and cannot be resolved through the judicial process. In this case, the question of whether the candidate was a resident of the state at the time of her election is a political question that should be left to the political branches of government, specifically the House of Representatives. The other options do not provide a strong constitutional basis for the defendants' demurrer: A is not supported by the text, C is not relevant to the demurrer, and D is not a relevant constitutional argument in this case.",
