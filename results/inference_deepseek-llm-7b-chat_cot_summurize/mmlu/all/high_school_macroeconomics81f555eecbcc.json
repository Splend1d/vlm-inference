What will happen to the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity?\n\nA. The equilibrium price will rise while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\nB. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\nC. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\nD. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nassistant:The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity are determined by the law of demand and supply. When the price of corn falls, the demand for corn increases, and when the price of seed corn and fertilizer falls, the supply of corn increases. Therefore, the equilibrium price will fall, and the equilibrium quantity will increase.\n\nThe correct answer is B. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.",
