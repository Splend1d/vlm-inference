A farmer is the owner of parcel \"B,\" which is situated lower than \"A\" on the mountainside. In 2000, the rancher, who owned both parcels of land, constructed a private drainage system.

The drainage system was built across both parcels of land, and the sewage from parcel \"A\" was draining through it to a municipal sewer. The odor from the drainage system is now affecting parcel \"B,\" and the farmer is suing the rancher for damages. As a matter of law, the drainage system is considered the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages. Therefore, the farmer should be awarded damages.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the deed to the farmer did not contain any covenants restricting the rancher's use of the land, but this does not exempt the rancher from responsibility for the damages caused by the drainage system. Answer B is incorrect because the farmer's proper cause of action is not for nuisance, but rather for trespass. Answer D is incorrect because the rancher had the right to improve his own land, and the drainage system was constructed on both parcels, not just the rancher's.",
