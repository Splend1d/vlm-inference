Homo erectus made and used spears with stone projectile points for hunting 500,000 years ago. The Kathu Pan site in South Africa is a significant archaeological site that has provided evidence of early human activity, including the discovery of stone spear points that are believed to have been used for hunting. These spear points are characteristic of the Homo erectus species, which lived during the early Pleistocene epoch and is known for its advanced stone tool making abilities.\n\nThe discovery of these spear points suggests that Homo erectus was capable of making and using spears for hunting. This is an important step in the evolution of human behavior, as hunting with spears was a significant shift from the more basic methods of hunting and gathering that had previously been used by early humans.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the use of spears with stone projectile points is not unique to Homo erectus. Similar spear points have been found in other parts of the world, indicating that this method of hunting was widespread among early human populations.\n\nIn summary, the experiments with stone spear points made to replicate those found at the Kathu Pan site in South Africa suggest that Homo erectus made and used spears with stone projectile points for hunting 500,000 years ago.",
