What are its sales?\n\nA. $3,750,000.00\nB. $480,000\nC. $300,000\nD. $1,500,000\n\nassistant:To find Felton Farm Supplies' sales, we will use the following formula:\n\nSales = Total Assets \u00d7 Return on Total Assets\n\nFirst, we need to find the total assets. We can do this using the net profit margin:\n\nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Assets\n\nSince we know the net profit margin is 5%, we can solve for net profit:\n\nNet Profit = Net Profit Margin \u00d7 Total Assets\nNet Profit = 0.05 \u00d7 300,000\nNet Profit = $15,000\n\nNow that we have the net profit, we can find the total assets:\n\nTotal Assets = Net Profit / Net Profit Margin\nTotal Assets = $15,000 / 0.05\nTotal Assets = $300,000\n\nNow we can find the sales using the return on total assets formula:\n\nSales = Total Assets \u00d7 Return on Total Assets\nSales = $300,000 \u00d7 0.08\nSales = $24,000\n\nNone of the given options match the correct answer, which is $24,000.",
