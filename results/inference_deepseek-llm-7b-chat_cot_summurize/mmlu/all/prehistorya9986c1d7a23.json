Egyptian emigrants who arrived on ships and taught the Maya how to build pyramids\n\nassistant:The answer is A. local elite who rose to power based on their popularity and knowledge of politics.\n\nThe strontium isotope ratios in the teeth of people buried at Cop\u00e1n can provide information about their geographical origins and migration patterns. The ratios of strontium isotopes in human teeth are influenced by the environmental factors, such as soil and water, in the area where a person grows up. Therefore, the strontium isotope ratios in the teeth can be used to trace the geographical origins of the individuals.\n\nBased on the strontium isotope ratios, it has been suggested that the rulers of Cop\u00e1n were local elite who rose to power based on their popularity and knowledge of politics. These individuals had migrated to the Cop\u00e1n region from different parts of the Maya territory, and they were able to establish themselves as rulers through their political skills and the support they received from the local population.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the rulers of Cop\u00e1n were foreigners from different regions across much of the Maya territory.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the rulers of Cop\u00e1n were not an elite class of astronomer-priests who ate mostly vegetables and fish. There is no evidence to suggest that their diet was primarily composed of vegetables and fish.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the rulers of Cop\u00e1n were Egyptian emigrants who arrived on ships and taught the Maya how to build pyramids.",
