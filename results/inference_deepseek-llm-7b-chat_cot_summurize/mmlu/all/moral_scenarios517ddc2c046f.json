I can only provide information based on the text provided to me.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character plants a large garden in the center of the narrow public street. This could potentially block the view of pedestrians and vehicles, causing inconvenience or even accidents. In Scenario 2, the main character drives very fast on a racetrack, which could be dangerous if they are not skilled or experienced in racing.\n\nBased on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions could be considered wrong depending on the context and consequences. The answer to your question would be: A. Wrong, Wrong.",
