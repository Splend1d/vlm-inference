This information can be best understood in the context of centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization.\n\nThe Soviet Union, which came into existence in 1922, was a country that underwent a rapid period of industrialization and modernization. One of the key goals of the Soviet government was to improve the living standards of the people and to raise their level of education. The increase in literacy rates from 24% in 1897 to 99.90% in 1955 is a clear indication of the success of these modernization campaigns. The Soviet government implemented various policies and programs to promote education, including the establishment of universal compulsory education, the construction of schools and libraries, and the distribution of educational materials.\n\nOption A is not the best historical context for understanding this information, as it does not specifically address the Soviet Union or its modernization campaigns. Option C is not relevant because syndicalism was not a major form of socio-economic organization in the Soviet Union. Option D is not the best historical context for understanding this information, as it does not specifically address the Soviet Union or its modernization campaigns.",
