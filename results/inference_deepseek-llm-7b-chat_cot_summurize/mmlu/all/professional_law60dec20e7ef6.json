The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n\nThe question states that the state labor code provides that no employer in the state shall knowingly employ an alien who is not lawfully residing in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful residents' right to work. The immigrant farm workers are bringing suit in state court pursuant to this statutory provision.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question does not mention any equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the question does not mention any Eleventh Amendment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the question states that the statute is about regulating the employment of aliens, which is not the same as regulating immigration. Therefore, it is not preempted by federal law.",
