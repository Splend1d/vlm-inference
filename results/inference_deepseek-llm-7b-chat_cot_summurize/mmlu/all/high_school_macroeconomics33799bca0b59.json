Assume a Classical aggregate supply curve.\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\nD. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.\n\nassistant:If the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, it implies that the economy is in a state of lower aggregate demand. As a result, firms will experience a decrease in the price they receive for their goods and services, which is represented by an upward shift of the aggregate supply curve. This increase in the price level is called the equilibrium price level.\n\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, it means that the economy experiences a decrease in the quantity of output produced by firms. This is because firms are now receiving lower prices for their goods and services, and as a result, they have less incentive to produce. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.",
