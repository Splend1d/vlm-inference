Baker adopted the MACRS depreciation system and did not utilize any special depreciation deductions. On March 1 of the current year, Baker sold the equipment. The MACRS depreciation schedule for five-year property is listed below:\nFirst year - 20.00%\nSecond year - 32.00%\nThird year - 19.20%\nWhat amount of depreciation can Baker deduct in the current year?\n\nA. $533\nB. $1,600\nC. $2,000\nD. $3,200\n\nassistant:To find the depreciation deduction for the current year, we need to determine the amount of depreciation that was already deducted in the first year. The amount of depreciation for the first year is $2,000. The remaining useful life of the equipment is four years (5 years - 1 year = 4 years). Therefore, the depreciation deduction for each of the next four years is:\n\nSecond year - 32.00% of $2,000 = $640\nThird year - 19.20% of $2,000 = $384\nFourth year - 19.20% of $2,000 = $384\nFifth year - 19.20% of $2,000 = $384\n\nThe total depreciation deduction for the remaining four years is $640 + $384 + $384 + $384 = $1,412. The total depreciation deduction for the current year is $2,000 (first year) + $1,412 (remaining years) = $3,412.\n\nThe correct answer is D. $3,200.",
