This theory, also known as the Frequency-Specific Pitch Theory, proposes that the basilar membrane in the cochlea is organized in a way that allows it to detect changes in frequency. The basilar membrane is a structure in the inner ear that vibrates in response to sound waves. The frequency at which the basilar membrane vibrates is directly related to the pitch of the sound. Therefore, the peak position on the basilar membrane corresponds to the frequency of the sound, which is why different frequencies produce different peak positions.",
