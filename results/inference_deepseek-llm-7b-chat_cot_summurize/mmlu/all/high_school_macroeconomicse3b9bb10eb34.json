You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend.\nB. The Department of Transportation repaves a road.\nC. Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies.\nD. A college buys computers.\n\nassistant:All of the events listed have the potential to affect GDP (Gross Domestic Product). GDP is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within a country during a specific period of time. \n\nA. Buying a car from a friend would not affect GDP directly because it is a transaction between individuals and not between a business and a consumer.\n\nB. Repaving a road would increase the value of the road, which is a form of infrastructure. This would likely increase GDP because it increases the value of infrastructure, which is a component of GDP.\n\nC. Making a music CD that doesn't sell any copies would not affect GDP directly because it is not a form of exchange that generates value.\n\nD. Buying computers from a college would affect GDP because it is a transaction between a business (the college) and a consumer (the college).\n\nIn conclusion, all of the events have the potential to affect GDP. However, buying a car from a friend and making a music CD that doesn't sell any copies are the two events that have the least direct impact on GDP.",
