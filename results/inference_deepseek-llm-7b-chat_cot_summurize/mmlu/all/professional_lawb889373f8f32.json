His aunt was currently in the hospital on a ventilator. Her condition was terminal, and the nephew could not wait to get his hands on his inheritance. One night, his girlfriend demanded that he buy her an engagement ring or she would break up with him.

The nurse is not responsible for the aunt's death, as she did not administer the powerful muscle relaxant to the aunt. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not guilty.",
