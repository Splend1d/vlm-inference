Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\nassistant:The court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene. The correct answer is D. Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.\n\nUnder Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may permit intervention of an \"indispensable party\" who has a \"significant interest\" in the outcome of the action. In this case, the employer has a significant interest in the outcome of the action because it has an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer.\n\nAdditionally, the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action. Both the employer and the clerk are claiming that the building owner was negligent in allowing the ice to form on the loading dock, and both are seeking damages for their respective injuries and property damage. Therefore, the employer's motion to intervene is likely to be granted.",
