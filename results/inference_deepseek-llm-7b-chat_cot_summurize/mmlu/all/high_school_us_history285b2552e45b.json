This desire was driven by the ongoing conflict in Vietnam, where American troops were fighting a civil war that many citizens saw as unnecessary and unwanted. The passage provided by John Kerry in 1971 highlights the fact that many Vietnamese people did not understand the difference between communism and democracy, and simply wanted to live in peace without the interference of foreign powers, particularly the United States. This sentiment was shared by many Americans, who saw the war in Vietnam as a divisive and unnecessary conflict that was eroding the nation's social fabric. As a result, candidates who promised to end the war and bring American troops home were more likely to win the support of the American public, leading to the defeat of Democratic presidential candidates in both 1952 and 1968.",
