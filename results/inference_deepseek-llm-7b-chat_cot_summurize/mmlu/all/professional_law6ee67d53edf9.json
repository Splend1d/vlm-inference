The woman, who was seriously injured in the accident, sued the motorboat operator in a personal injury action. During the course of the lawsuit, an important question of consequence was the wind speed on the afternoon the woman was sailing. At trial, the woman calls an orthopedic surgeon to testi1'. The surgeon, who is an amateur boating enthusiast, testified that he was navigating his sailboat into the bay when the motorboat hit the woman. Furthermore, the surgeon testified that in the cockpit of his boat he maintains a sophisticated electronic weathering device that measures wind speed, temperature, and barometric pressure at periodic intervals. The woman then offers into evidence the computer printout from the surgeon's weathering device measuring the wind speed at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the motorboat operator, the printout is\n\nA. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nB. admissible as the record of regularly conducted activity.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, unless there is foundation testimony as to the accuracy and good working condition of the surgeon's electronic weathering device on the afternoon in question.\n\nassistant:The admissibility of the printout from the surgeon's weathering device measuring the wind speed at the time of the accident depends on whether it meets the requirements for admissibility as a past recollection recorded or as the record of a regularly conducted activity.\n\nOption A: If the printout is admissible as past recollection recorded, it means that the printout was created at or near the time of the accident by the surgeon himself or herself, and it was created for the purpose of preserving information about the accident. In this case, the printout is admissible as the woman calls the surgeon to testify about his or her recollection of the accident, including the wind speed at the time of the accident.\n\nOption B: If the printout is admissible as the record of a regularly conducted activity, it means that the surgeon maintains a regular practice of recording the wind speed, temperature, and barometric pressure at periodic intervals while sailing. In this case, the printout is admissible if the surgeon regularly conducts this activity and the printout is an accurate record of the wind speed at the time of the accident.\n\nOption C: If the printout is inadmissible as hearsay, it means that the printout is not admissible because it is a statement made by the surgeon or a third party that the surgeon relied on to testify at trial. In this case, the printout would not be admissible unless it falls within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nOption D: If the printout is inadmissible, it means that the printout is not admissible because it does not meet the requirements for admissibility as a past recollection recorded or as the record of a regularly conducted activity. In this case, the printout would be inadmissible unless there is foundation testimony as to the accuracy and good working condition of the surgeon's electronic weathering device on the afternoon in question.\n\nIn this case, the printout is more likely to be admissible as a past recollection recorded, since the surgeon was an amateur boating enthusiast who maintained a sophisticated electronic weathering device to record the wind speed, temperature, and barometric pressure at periodic intervals. The printout is admissible as past recollection recorded if it was created at or near the time of the accident by the surgeon himself or herself, and it was created for the purpose of preserving information about the accident. However, if the printout is admissible as the record of a regularly conducted activity, the printout must also meet the requirements for admissibility as a record of a regularly conducted activity, such as the surgeon maintaining a regular practice of recording the wind speed, temperature, and barometric pressure at periodic intervals while sailing.",
