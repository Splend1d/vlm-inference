A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council.

Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant laws and policies at the federal and state levels.\n\n1. At the federal level, the U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba.\n2. The state government enacted a law that prohibits state agencies from purchasing services or goods from and companies doing business with Cuba.\n3. The National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional.\n\nBased on the information provided, the federal government was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government, and the U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. This indicates that the federal government was taking steps to normalize relations with Cuba. In contrast, the state law prohibits state agencies from purchasing services or goods from and companies doing business with Cuba, which is at odds with the federal government's policies.\n\nFurthermore, the National Trade Council, which includes 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state, is seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba is unconstitutional.\n\nGiven the conflicting policies between the federal and state governments, and the fact that the National Trade Council is suing the state, it is likely that the federal court will grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.",
