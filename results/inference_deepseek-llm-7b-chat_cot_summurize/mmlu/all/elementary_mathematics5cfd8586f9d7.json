He has 6 times as many cows as he has horses. The number sentence below can be used to find the number of horses, h, he has. 72 \ufffd h = 6 How many horses, h, does Gary have?\n\nA. 12 horses\nB. 66 horses\nC. 78 horses\nD. 432 horses\n\nassistant:To find the number of horses Gary has, we can use the given equation:\n\n72 \ufffd h = 6\n\nWe can solve for h by multiplying both sides of the equation by h:\n\nh \u00d7 72 \ufffd 6 = h\n\nNow we can simplify:\n\nh \u00d7 12 = h\n\nSince h is multiplied by 12, we can find h by dividing both sides by 12:\n\nh = 12\n\nTherefore, Gary has 12 horses. The correct answer is A. 12 horses.",
