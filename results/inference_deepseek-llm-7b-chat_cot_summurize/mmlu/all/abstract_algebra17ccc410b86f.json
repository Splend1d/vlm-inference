Statement 2 | Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring.\n\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\n\nassistant:Statement 1: Every ideal in a ring is a subring of the ring. This statement is true. An ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under the ring's multiplication and addition operations, and it satisfies the ring's additive and multiplicative identities. Therefore, it is indeed a subring of the ring.\n\nStatement 2: Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring. This statement is false. While it is true that every subring of a ring is an ideal of that ring (because it satisfies the properties of being a subset and closed under the ring's operations), not every ideal is a subring of every ring. For example, consider the ring of integers modulo 5. Its only ideal is the trivial ideal {0}, but it is not a subring of the ring of integers modulo 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
