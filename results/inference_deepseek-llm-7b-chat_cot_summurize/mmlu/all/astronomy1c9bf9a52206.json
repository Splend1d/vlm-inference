Amino acids with a preferred orientation or \"chirality\"\n\nAmino acids with a preferred orientation or \"chirality\" were not cited as evidence for life in the Martian meteorite ALH84001. The other options are considered as evidence for the presence of life on Mars:\n\nA. Complex organic molecules specifically PAHs: The presence of complex organic molecules, including PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons), was considered as evidence for the potential presence of life on Mars. These molecules could have been produced through biological processes, such as photosynthesis.\n\nB. Magnetite grains similar to those formed by bacteria on Earth: Magnetite is a mineral that can be formed by bacteria on Earth. The presence of magnetite grains in ALH84001 was considered as evidence for potential microbial life on Mars.\n\nC. Carbonate minerals indicating a thicker warmer Martian atmosphere: The presence of carbonate minerals in ALH84001 was considered as evidence for a warmer and more Earth-like environment on Mars in the past. This could potentially support the existence of life on the planet.",
