The husband and brother purchased the land as joint tenants, which means they each owned an equal one-half interest in the land. Therefore, the cousin inherited an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the cousin inherited an undivided one-half interest in the land, not an undivided one-third interest.\nOption B is incorrect because the cousin inherited an undivided one-half interest in the land, not an undivided one-quarter interest.\nOption D is incorrect because the cousin inherited an undivided one-half interest in the land, not an undivided three-quarters interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. an undivided one-half interest in the land.",
