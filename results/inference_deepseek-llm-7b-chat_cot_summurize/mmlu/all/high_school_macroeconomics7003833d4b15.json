Nation A has absolute advantage in the production of that good.\nD. Nation B has absolute advantage in the production of that good.\n\nassistant:A. Nation A has comparative advantage in the production of that good.\n\nIn economics, a comparative advantage is a situation in which an individual, firm, or country can produce a specific good or service at a lower opportunity cost than others. This means that even if they lack an absolute advantage (i.e., they cannot produce the good or service more efficiently than another country), they can still produce the good or service at a lower opportunity cost.\n\nIn this case, if Nation A can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than Nation B, it implies that Nation A has a comparative advantage in the production of that good. This does not necessarily mean that Nation A can produce the good more efficiently than Nation B, but rather that it can produce it at a lower opportunity cost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Nation A has comparative advantage in the production of that good.",
