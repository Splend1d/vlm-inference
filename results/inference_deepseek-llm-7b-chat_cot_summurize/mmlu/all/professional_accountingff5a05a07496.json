For tax purposes which of the following statements is correct regarding Studio's status as a partnership?\n\nA. Studio terminated as of January 1.\nB. Studio terminated as of April 9.\nC. Studio terminated as of December 31.\nD. Studio did not terminate.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided and determine the correct status of Studio Partnership as of December 31.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the information provided\n- On January 1, the partners' interest percentages were: Ross 15%, Stone 35%, Taylor 50%.\n- On April 9, Stone sold his entire interest to Taylor, which means Taylor's percentage increased to 85%, and Stone's percentage decreased to 0%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total percentage of the partnership after Stone sold his interest to Taylor\n- Total percentage = Taylor's percentage + Ross's percentage + Stone's percentage (before selling)\n- Total percentage = 85% + 15% + 35% (Stone's percentage before selling)\n- Total percentage = 135%\n\nStep 3: Compare the total percentage to the threshold for partnership status termination (75%)\n- Since the total percentage of the partnership is greater than 75%, Studio Partnership did not terminate as of December 31.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Studio did not terminate.",
