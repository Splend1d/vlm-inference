This is an example of a logical fallacy known as false dichotomy, where the arguer claims that their opponent has only two options and dismisses any other possibilities. This is a common tactic in argumentation to make one's own position seem more reasonable and convincing.\n\nA. ignoring another person's arguments and attacking her character instead is an example of ad hominem fallacy, which involves attacking the person rather than addressing their argument.\n\nC. causing confusion during an argument by a lack of ability to engage in refutation is an example of tu quoque fallacy, which is a type of ad hominem fallacy where the arguer accuses the other person of the same fault that they themselves are committing.\n\nD. using threats of harm instead of reasoning to gain agreement is an example of blackmail, which is a form of coercion that involves threatening harm or harming someone unless they agree to something.",
