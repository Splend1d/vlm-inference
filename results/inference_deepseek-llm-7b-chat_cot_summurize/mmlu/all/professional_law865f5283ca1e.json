Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. Murder.\n\nassistant:The most serious crime for which the defendant should be found guilty is D. Murder. The victim died in the hospital two hours after being struck by the defendant's car, which indicates a fatal injury. Involuntary manslaughter is the least serious option and involves a death that results from an unlawful act, but without a specific intent to cause harm. Voluntary manslaughter involves a death that results from unlawful conduct that does have a specific intent to cause harm. The defendant's speeding in violation of a state regulation, while reckless and dangerous, does not necessarily meet the criteria for murder, which requires a specific intent to cause death.",
