Every morning the bakery bakes 3,000 loaves. What is the probability that today it will run out of bread? Assume that the mean daily demand for bread at this bakery is normally distributed.\n\nA. 0.8333\nB. 0.1667\nC. 0.9869\nD. 0.0132\n\nassistant:To find the probability that the bakery will run out of bread, we need to determine when the daily demand exceeds 3,000 loaves. We can do this by finding the z-score for 3,000 loaves:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = (3000 - 2500) / 225 = 2\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 2:\n\nP(Z > 2) \u2248 0.0132\n\nTherefore, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today is approximately 1.32%. The closest answer is D.",
