The question involves a witness from the defendant corporation, who is considered an adverse party to the plaintiff.\n2. According to the Federal Rules of Evidence, adverse parties are allowed to be interrogated by leading questions and subjected to impeachment.\n3. Therefore, the trial court should overrule all the objections and allow the plaintiff to ask leading questions and impeach the witness during the plaintiff's case-in-chief.",
