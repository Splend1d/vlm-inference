The retinal images of the statue change, but you do not perceive these changes because of\n\nA. convergence\nB. motion parallax\nC. perceptual constancy\nD. interpositioning\n\nassistant:The correct answer is C. perceptual constancy.\n\nPerceptual constancy is the ability to perceive objects consistently, despite changes in their appearance. In this case, even though the retinal images of the statue change due to factors such as distance and angle, the user perceives the statue as the same object because of their ability to recognize and perceive it consistently.",
