Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nassistant:To determine the best course of action for the firm, we can use the concept of marginal product. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the increase in the product of output that results from the employment of one more unit of labor, assuming that the amount of capital used remains constant. Similarly, the marginal product of capital (MPK) is the increase in the product of output that results from the employment of one more unit of capital, assuming that the amount of labor used remains constant.\n\nIn this case, the marginal product of labor is 200, and the marginal product of capital is 50. To maximize the firm's output, the firm should employ as much labor as possible, while keeping the capital input constant. Therefore, the firm should choose option D: Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises. This will lead to an increase in the firm's output.",
