No, a juvenile cannot be convicted of a crime in a juvenile proceeding except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe other answers are wrong for the following reasons:\n\nA. This answer suggests that the juvenile does not get all of the rights enjoyed by adults. However, the question does not mention whether the juvenile enjoys the same rights as an adult. Moreover, this answer confuses the reasonable doubt standard with the burden of proof.\n\nC. This answer mixes up the reasonable doubt standard with the constitutional rights in a juvenile proceeding. The reasonable doubt standard is not a constitutional right; it is a legal requirement that must be met to convict someone.\n\nD. This answer is incorrect because a juvenile court proceeding is not always followed by a de novo proceeding in adult court. In some cases, the juvenile court may order rehabilitation or other non-punitive measures.",
