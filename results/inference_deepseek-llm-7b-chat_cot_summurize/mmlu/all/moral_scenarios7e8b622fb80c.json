Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character discovers a bedroom on fire and lets their husband sleep without waking them up. This decision could potentially lead to serious harm or even death, and is therefore clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character plans to meet up after a heist, which is a criminal activity. While this may be morally wrong, it is not as clear-cut as the first scenario because the main character is not directly causing harm to others.",
