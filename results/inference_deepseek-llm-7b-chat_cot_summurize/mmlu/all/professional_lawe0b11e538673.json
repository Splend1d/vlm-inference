Yes, she can claim a lack of informed consent as to the hysterectomy.\n\nThe patient has a valid theory of recovery against the surgeon because the surgeon performed a full hysterectomy without informing the patient of the decision or obtaining her consent. The expert's testimony that the surgeon committed no negligence does not absolve the surgeon of responsibility for obtaining informed consent. The patient may be able to recover damages for the unnecessary and unauthorized hysterectomy, even if the appendectomy was performed without negligence.",
