Ask them to take lots of small, quick breaths in before using the inhaler.\n\nTo ensure that a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways, it is important to use the inhaler correctly. One way to do this is to take multiple small, quick breaths in before using the inhaler. This will help to ensure that the inhaler is delivering the medication to the lower airways where it is needed. Additionally, it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for using the inhaler and to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any questions or concerns about your inhaler technique.",
