The car dealer performed a thorough inspection of the station wagon before the sale was completed. One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n\nassistant:B. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\n\nIn this scenario, the consumer's claim against the car dealer would likely be successful under the theory of strict liability in tort. Strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds a defendant liable for harm caused by a defective product, regardless of whether the defendant acted negligently or with intent to cause harm.\n\nIn this case, the defect that caused the brake failure was present when the consumer purchased the car. This means that the car dealer is strictly liable for the defect, and the consumer can assert a claim against the dealer for the resulting harm.\n\nThe fact that the consumer was speeding up at the time of the brake failure does not necessarily negate the claim against the car dealer. Strict liability in tort is a separate legal doctrine from contributory negligence, which holds a plaintiff partially liable for their own injuries if they contributed to the harm through their own actions. In this case, the consumer's speeding up may have exacerbated the severity of the accident, but it does not absolve the car dealer of responsibility for the defect that caused the brake failure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.",
