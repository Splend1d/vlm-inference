Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office.

A restrictive covenant is a legal agreement between two or more parties that restricts the use of property. In this case, the investor's subdivision plan creates a restrictive covenant that restricts the use of the 10-acre tract for a public school building, while allowing the remaining 90 acres to be used for residential building lots. This restriction benefits the subdivision residents by providing them with a close proximity to the school and avoiding the need for the county school district to expend tax money to acquire the property for school construction. However, the restrictive covenant is unenforceable against the county school board, as it is not binding on them. Therefore, the correct answer is B. restrictive covenant.",
