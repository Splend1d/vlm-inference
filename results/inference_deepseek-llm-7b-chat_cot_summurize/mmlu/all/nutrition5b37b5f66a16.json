Iodine and vitamin C\nB. Copper and iron\nC. Zinc and protein\nD. Vitamin D and zinc\n\nassistant:Deficiencies of certain nutrients can lead to various health issues, including anaemia. In the case of iron, it is essential for the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron deficiency anaemia is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide, and it is caused by a lack of iron in the diet.\n\nOption B, copper and iron, is not directly related to anaemia. Copper is a trace element required for various bodily functions, but it does not play a significant role in the prevention of anaemia.\n\nOption C, zinc and protein, also does not directly relate to anaemia. While protein is essential for the growth and maintenance of body tissues, zinc is required for various enzymatic processes, immune function, and wound healing, but it does not have a direct link to anaemia.\n\nOption D, Vitamin D and zinc, does not directly relate to anaemia either. Vitamin D is important for bone health and immune function, while zinc plays a role in wound healing, but neither of these nutrients are directly linked to anaemia.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Deficiencies of copper and iron can lead to anaemia. Iron is crucial for the production of red blood cells, and a lack of iron in the diet can result in iron-deficiency anaemia, which is the most common type of anaemia worldwide.",
