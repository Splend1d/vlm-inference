Either of these\nD. None of these\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. vertical.\n\nThe component of velocity that remains constant for a tossed baseball is its vertical velocity. This is because, after being released, the baseball undergoes horizontal motion due to air resistance and the force of gravity pulling it down. The vertical motion is not affected by these forces, so it remains constant until the ball hits the ground.",
