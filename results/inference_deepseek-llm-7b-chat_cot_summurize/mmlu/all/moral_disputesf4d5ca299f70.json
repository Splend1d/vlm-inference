This is known as the \"difference principle\" in Rawls' theory of justice. The difference principle states that inequalities are only just if they are to the benefit of the least advantaged members of society. Rawls' theory of justice is often contrasted with the \"fairness principle,\" which holds that the least advantaged members of society should be given the greatest advantages.",
