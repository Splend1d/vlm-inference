It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia\nB. It causes a large multi-nodular goitre\nC. It is commoner in males than females\nD. In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck'\n\nassistant:Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It is characterized by hyperthyroidism, which means that the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\n\nOption A: Graves' disease can cause ophthalmoplegia, which is a condition that affects the muscles controlling eye movement. This occurs when the thyroid hormone causes inflammation and swelling of the muscles surrounding the eyes.\n\nOption B: Graves' disease can cause a goitre, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. However, a large multi-nodular goitre is not a specific symptom of Graves' disease.\n\nOption C: Graves' disease is not more common in males than females. In fact, it affects both males and females equally.\n\nOption D: \"Derbyshire Neck\" is not a symptom or complication associated with Graves' disease. It is a rare condition that causes the neck to become rigid and immobile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Graves' disease can cause ophthalmoplegia.",
