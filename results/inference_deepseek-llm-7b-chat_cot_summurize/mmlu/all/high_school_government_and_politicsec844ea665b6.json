Impeachment, conviction, and removal from office by Congress\nB. Removal from office by the appointing president\nC. Removal from office by the president-elect\nD. Recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction\n\nassistant:Federal judges are subject to disciplinary actions by the judicial branch, not the legislative or executive branches. Therefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect.\n\nOption D states that federal judges are subject to recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction. This is accurate because federal judges are subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives, and if the impeachment is successful, they can be removed from office by the Senate. However, the process of impeachment and removal is different from the recall process used in some states for local officials.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Federal judges are subject to recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction.",
