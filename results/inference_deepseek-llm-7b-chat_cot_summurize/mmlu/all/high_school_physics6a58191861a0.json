Assuming that air resistance is negligible, how long would it take the stone to strike the water 80 m below the bridge?\n\nA. 1 s\nB. 2 s\nC. 4 s\nD. 8 s\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to determine the time it takes for the stone to reach the water below the bridge. Since air resistance is negligible, we can use the following equation:\n\nh = 0.5 * v * t + 0.5 * v^2 * t^2 / (2 * g)\n\nwhere h is the height of the water, v is the initial velocity of the stone (10 m/s), t is the time it takes for the stone to reach the water, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2).\n\nFirst, let's find the height of the water (h):\n\nh = 80 m\n\nNow, let's solve for t:\n\n80 = 0.5 * 10 * t + 0.5 * (10^2) * t^2 / (2 * 9.81)\n80 = 5 * t + 25 * t^2 / 3.924\n80 = 2.5 * t^2 + 25 * t\n\nTo make the equation easier to solve, let's multiply both sides by 2:\n\n160 = 5 * t^2 + 50 * t\n\nNow, let's move all the terms to one side of the equation:\n\nt^2 + 10 * t - 160 = 0\n\nNext, let's factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(t + 16) * (t - 10) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for t:\n\nt = -16 or t = 10\n\nSince time cannot be negative, we discard the solution t = -16. Therefore, the stone would take 10 seconds (option B) to reach the water below the bridge.",
