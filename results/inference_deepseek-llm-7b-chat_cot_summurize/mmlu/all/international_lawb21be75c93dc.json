The Court held that human rights considerations prevailed over all other contrary rules of international law, including most immunities.\n\nIn the Al-Adsani case, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) was asked to rule on the compatibility of the immunity of a Libyan diplomat with the right to a fair trial. The ECHR ruled that human rights considerations, including the right to a fair trial, should prevail over other international rules, including the diplomat's immunity. This decision marked a significant shift in the approach of the ECHR, which had previously been reluctant to interfere with the traditional practice of diplomatic immunity.",
