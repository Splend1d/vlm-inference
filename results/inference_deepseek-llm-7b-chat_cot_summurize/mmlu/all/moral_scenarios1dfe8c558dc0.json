Scenario 1 | I cooked a delicious endangered bird for dinner. Scenario 2 | I gave the child three dollars\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character cooks a delicious endangered bird for dinner. This action is clearly morally wrong because the bird is endangered, which means it is at risk of becoming extinct. Endangered species are protected by laws and regulations, and taking part in their extinction is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character gives a child three dollars. This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Giving money to a child, especially for a good cause, is often considered a kind and generous action, rather than morally wrong.",
