The current value of y\nB. Zero\nC. One\nD. The average value of y over the in-sample period\n\nassistant:A random walk is a stochastic process where the next value is assumed to be independent of all previous values. Therefore, if a series follows a random walk, the optimal one-step ahead forecast would be C. One. This means that the next value in the series will be one step ahead of the current value, which is not influenced by any previous values in the series.",
