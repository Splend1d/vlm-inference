An aldehyde\nB. An alkane\nC. An alcohol\nD. An ether\n\nassistant:To answer this question, I will need to analyze the structures of each of the options and determine which one does not contain oxygen.\n\nA. An aldehyde: Aldehydes contain a carbonyl group (-C=O), which is composed of a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom. This means that aldehydes contain oxygen.\n\nB. An alkane: Alkanes are a type of hydrocarbon that contains only single bonds between carbon atoms and no functional groups. They do not contain oxygen.\n\nC. An alcohol: Alcohols contain a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a carbon atom. This group is composed of a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom. This means that alcohols contain oxygen.\n\nD. An ether: Etheres contain a carbon-oxygen double bond (-O-C-). This group is composed of a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom. This means that ethers contain oxygen.\n\nBased on the analysis of the structures of each of the options, the answer is B. An alkane does not contain oxygen.",
