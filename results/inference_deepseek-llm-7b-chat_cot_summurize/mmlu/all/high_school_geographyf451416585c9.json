This theory suggests that whoever controlled the central region of Europe, known as the heartland, would have a strategic advantage in controlling the continent and, by extension, the world. This theory is based on the idea that controlling Europe's central region would allow a power to control the major trade routes, resources, and key cities, giving it a dominant position in the continent.",
