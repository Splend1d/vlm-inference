Which of the following descriptions best fits Bill?\n\nA. female impersonator\nB. drag queen\nC. transsexual\nD. transvestite\n\nassistant:A. female impersonator\n\nBill's behavior is best described as a female impersonator because he is dressing up in his wife's clothes and accessories for his own sexual pleasure, rather than performing in a theatrical context like a drag queen or undergoing gender reassignment surgery like a transsexual. A transvestite is a person who enjoys dressing in the clothing of the opposite gender, but Bill is not necessarily transitioning or identifying as the opposite gender.",
