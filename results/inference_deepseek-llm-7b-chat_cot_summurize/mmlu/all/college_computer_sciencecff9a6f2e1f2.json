The size of these packets is 1,000 bytes. The network has the capacity to carry 1,000 packets per second. The CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds.

Size of each data packet: 1,000 bytes\n2. Network capacity: 1,000 packets per second\n3. CPU time required to send one packet: 10 milliseconds\n\nFirst, let's convert the network capacity from packets to bytes per second.\n1,000 packets per second = 1,000 bytes/packet * 1,000 bytes/packet * 1 second/packet = 1,000,000 bytes/second\n\nNext, let's calculate the CPU time required to send a single byte.\n10 milliseconds = 0.1 seconds\n\nNow, let's calculate the CPU time required to send 1,000 bytes.\n0.1 seconds/packet * 1,000 packets = 10 milliseconds\n\nSince the CPU time required to send one byte is the same as the network capacity, we can conclude that one computer can send 1,000 bytes per second to another computer.\n\nTherefore, the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is approximately A. 10,000 bytes/second.",
