He carried out his waterbed, dresser, and all of his clothes. As the tenant inspected the room one last time, he noticed a bookcase that he had screwed into the wall when he first moved in.

In this scenario, the tenant did not have the right to remove the bookcase, as it constituted a fixture and was a permanent part of the realty. The tenant's decision to remove the bookcase without the landlord's permission constitutes larceny, which is the unlawful taking and carrying away of personal property. Therefore, the correct answer is A. guilty.",
