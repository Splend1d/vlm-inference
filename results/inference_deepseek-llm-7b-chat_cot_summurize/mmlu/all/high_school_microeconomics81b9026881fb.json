When the demand for grapes increases and the supply of grapes also increases, the equilibrium quantity will rise. This means that the market is in equilibrium, meaning that there is no excess supply or demand. As a result, the price of grapes will also rise.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the equilibrium quantity is not ambiguous in this case. It rises as the demand increases and the supply also increases.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the equilibrium quantity does not fall when the supply of grapes increases. It rises as the demand increases.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the equilibrium quantity does not fall when the demand for grapes increases. It rises as the demand increases.",
