The\ncone\u2019s height and radius are 2 cm and 1 cm, respectively. At what rate does the height of the water change\nwhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone?

We are given that V = (\u03c0/3)r^2 * h = 6 cm^3, and r = 1 cm and h = 2 cm - t/2.\n\nThe rate of change of the water height h is given by the volume flow rate dV/dt. We can find dV/dt using the chain rule:\n\ndV/dt = (dV/dh) * (dh/dt)\n\nNow, we compute (dV/dh) and (dh/dt):\n\n(dV/dh) = (\u03c0/3) * r^2 * dh/h = (\u03c0/3) * r^2 * (-2/t) = -\u03c0 * r^2 / 3t\n\n(dh/dt) = dh / t = 1 / t\n\nNow we can find dV/dt:\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3) * r^2 * (-2/t) * (1/t) = -\u03c0r^2 / 3t^2\n\nNow we can find the rate of change of the height of the water h when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone:\n\ndV/dt = -\u03c0r^2 / 3t^2 = -\u03c0 * (1 cm)^2 / (3 * (2 cm - (1/2 cm))^2)\n\nTo evaluate this, we can substitute t = 2 cm - 1/2 cm = 1.5 cm:\n\ndV/dt = -\u03c0 * (1 cm)^2 / (3 * (2 cm - 1.5 cm)^2) = -\u03c0 cm^2/3 * (0.5 cm)^2 / (3 * (0.5 cm)^2) = -\u03c0 cm^2/3 * 1/3 = -\u03c0 cm^2/9\n\nFinally, we can convert this to cm/min:\n\ndV/dt = -\u03c0/9 cm^2/min = -\u03c0/(9 * 3.14) cm^2/min = -\u03c0/(28.28) cm^2/min \u2248 -0.0171 cm^2/min\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the height of the water changes when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone is approximately -0.0171 cm^2/min, or -17.1 cm^2/h.\n\nThe closest option to this value is D. -16/(3\u03c0) cm/min.",
