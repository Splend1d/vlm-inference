Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases\nB. It is an example of an oligoarthropathy\nC. Anaemia is a common finding\nD. Heberden's nodes are a feature\n\nassistant:Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints, causing pain, swelling, and stiffness. Let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\nA. Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases - This statement is partially true. Rheumatoid factor is an autoantibody that is found in around 70-90% of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the presence of rheumatoid factor is not exclusive to RA, as it can also be detected in other autoimmune disorders and in individuals with a history of exposure to certain antigens.\n\nB. It is an example of an oligoarthropathy - This statement is not true. Oligoarthropathy refers to a condition characterized by inflammation and pain in four or fewer joints. RA typically affects multiple joints simultaneously, and therefore does not fit the description of an oligoarthropathy.\n\nC. Anaemia is a common finding - This statement is true. Anaemia is a common finding in individuals with RA, as the disease can lead to inflammation, destruction of the bone marrow, and reduced production of red blood cells.\n\nD. Heberden's nodes are a feature - This statement is not true. Heberden's nodes are bony outgrowths on the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers that are more commonly associated with osteoarthritis. While they can be present in RA, they are not a specific feature of the disease.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C. Anaemia is a common finding in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.",
