From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.\n\nassistant:B. Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.\n\nThe correct answer is B, as it ensures that a representative sample of customers from different geographical regions is obtained. A random sample of customers from the past 12 months would provide a more diverse and accurate representation of the company's customer base, as opposed to selecting all customers who joined within the last month or choosing a specific percentage of customers from each state.\n\nOption C would not be representative since it only considers the customers' location and not their membership duration, which is relevant for the survey. Option D is too specific, as choosing only 3% of customers from each state could lead to an overly-representative sample of a specific state or a non-representative sample of other states. Option A is also not ideal because it only considers customers who joined in the last month, which may not provide a broad enough sample size to represent the company's customer base accurately.",
