The margin obtained by two different kernels on the same training set does provide us with some insight into which classifier will perform better on the test set. A larger margin indicates a stronger classifier, so classifiers with larger margins are generally better at generalizing to new data.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The activation function of BERT is the GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit). This activation function is used in the Transformer model that BERT is based on, and is known for its simplicity and effectiveness.",
