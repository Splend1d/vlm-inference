Officers in the armed forces\n\nassistant:The segment of the Russian/Soviet population that would probably have benefited most from the rising literacy rates depicted in the chart is the urban middle class. The literacy rate among the Russian-speaking population of late Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union rose from 24% in 1897 to 99.90% in 1955, indicating a significant increase in literacy.\n\nThe urban middle class would have been most affected by these changes because they were the most likely to have access to education and to benefit from it. The rural peasantry, members of the Russian Orthodox clergy, and officers in the armed forces may not have had the same level of access to education as the urban middle class, and thus may not have seen the same level of improvement in literacy rates.\n\nAdditionally, the urban middle class was the most politically active and influential segment of Russian society during the period in question. This group included professionals, merchants, and intellectuals, and they were the driving force behind the Russian Revolution and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn conclusion, the urban middle class was the most likely segment of the Russian/Soviet population to have benefited from the rising literacy rates depicted in the chart. This was due to their higher level of access to education, their political influence, and their central role in shaping the course of Russian history during this period.",
