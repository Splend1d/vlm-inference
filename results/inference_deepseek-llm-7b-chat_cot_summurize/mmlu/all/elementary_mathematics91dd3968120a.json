How many ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar?\n\nA. 2\nB. 3.6\nC. 22.5\nD. 63\n\nassistant:To determine the answer, we can set up a proportion to represent the problem:\n\nVinegar / Oil = 2 / 5\n\nWe are given that vinegar is 9 ounces, so we can substitute that into the proportion:\n\n9 ounces / Oil = 2 / 5\n\nNow, we can solve for the amount of oil:\n\nOil = (9 ounces) * (5 / 2)\nOil = (45 / 2) ounces\nOil = 22.5 ounces\n\nThe correct answer is C. 22.5 ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar.",
