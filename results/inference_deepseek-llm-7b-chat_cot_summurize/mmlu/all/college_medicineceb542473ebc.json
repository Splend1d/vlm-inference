If the starting velocity of water from a fire hydrant is 2 m/s, pressure is kept constant, and the end of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the start of the hose, what is the final velocity of water as it exits?\n\nA. 2 m/s\nB. 8 m/s\nC. 5 m/s\nD. 6 m/s\n\nassistant:Let's denote the starting velocity as V, the final velocity as V', the area of the nozzle as A, and the length of the hose as L. We know that V = 2 m/s. The pressure is kept constant, so the equation for the final velocity is:\n\nV' = V - (A / L)\n\nWe are given that the area of the nozzle is 1/3 the area of the start of the hose, so:\n\nA = (1/3) * A_start\n\nWe can plug this into the equation for the final velocity:\n\nV' = V - (1/3) * A_start / L\n\nNow we can solve for V':\n\nV' = 2 - (1/3) * A_start / L\n\nSince the starting velocity is 2 m/s, we can write:\n\n2 = 2 - (1/3) * A_start / L\n\nSolving for A_start, we get:\n\nA_start = (3/4) * L\n\nNow we can plug this into the equation for V':\n\nV' = 2 - (1/3) * (3/4) * L / L\n\nV' = 2 - (1/4)\n\nV' = 3/2\n\nV' = 1.5 m/s\n\nSo the final velocity of the water as it exits is 1.5 m/s, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
