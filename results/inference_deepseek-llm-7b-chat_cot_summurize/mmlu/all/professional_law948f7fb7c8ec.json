There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n\nassistant:The best argument for the landscaper in this scenario would be that there is no privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association. The gardener sold his land to the landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions, meaning there was no contract between the two parties. Therefore, the landscaper is not obligated to pay the annual assessment for lot 29.\n\nThe other options are not as strong because they do not address the main issue at hand. Option A is not relevant because the community association is suing the landscaper, not the housing corporation. Option B is not strong because the charge does constitute a lien, but this does not absolve the landscaper of his personal obligation to pay. Option C is not strong because there was no contract between the gardener and the landscaper, but this does not necessarily mean the landscaper is obligated to pay the annual assessment for lot 29.",
