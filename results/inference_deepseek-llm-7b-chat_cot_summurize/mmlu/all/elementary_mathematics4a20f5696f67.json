If one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds, how long did it take him to wash his car?\n\nA. 10 minutes\nB. 13 minutes\nC. 16 minutes\nD. 32.5 minutes\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find out how many quarters it took for Marcus to wash his car. We know that one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds, so we can set up a proportion to find the answer.\n\nLet x be the number of quarters Marcus used.\n\nx quarters * 60 seconds = $3.25\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx * 60 = $3.25\nx = $3.25 / 60\nx \u2248 0.0542\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a quarter, we can round up to the nearest whole number. So, Marcus used 1 quarter to wash his car.\n\nNow, we can calculate how long it took him to wash his car:\n\n1 quarter * 60 seconds = 60 seconds\n60 seconds \u2248 60 / 60\n60 seconds \u2248 10 minutes\n\nSo, it took Marcus approximately 10 minutes to wash his car.\n\nThe answer is A. 10 minutes.",
