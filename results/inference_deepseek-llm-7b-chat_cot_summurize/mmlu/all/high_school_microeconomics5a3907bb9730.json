(I)) Rival firms act independently of each other.\n\nassistant:(D) Rival firms act independently of each other.\n\nAn oligopoly is a market structure characterized by a small number of firms selling similar products or services. In an oligopoly, the firms act independently of each other, as they compete for market share and try to maximize their profits. In the given options, (A) and (B) describe price matching behavior, which is more characteristic of monopolistic competition. Option (C) is also related to price matching behavior, but it does not fully describe the oligopoly market structure. Therefore, the best answer is (D), where rival firms act independently of each other.",
