Kantianism\nC. utilitarianism\nD. natural law theory\n\nassistant:The idea of \"using someone as a mere means\" is centrally relevant to the moral theory of Kantianism. According to Kantianism, individuals have inherent moral worth and should never be treated as mere means to an end. Instead, they should be respected as ends in themselves. This theory emphasizes the importance of treating people with dignity and respect, and considering their rights and autonomy.\n\nIn consequentialism, the moral value of an action is determined by its consequences, rather than its inherent moral worth. Therefore, using someone as a means would not necessarily be considered wrong if it led to a desirable outcome.\n\nUtilitarianism is a moral theory that prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number. According to this theory, an action is morally right if it produces the greatest overall happiness or well-being. However, using someone as a means would not necessarily be considered wrong if it led to the greatest overall happiness or well-being.\n\nNatural law theory is a moral theory that emphasizes the inherent moral order of the universe. According to this theory, individuals have an innate sense of what is right and wrong, which is derived from this moral order. However, using someone as a means would not necessarily be considered wrong if it aligned with this inherent moral order.\n\nTherefore, the moral theory most centrally relevant to the idea of \"using someone as a mere means\" is Kantianism.",
