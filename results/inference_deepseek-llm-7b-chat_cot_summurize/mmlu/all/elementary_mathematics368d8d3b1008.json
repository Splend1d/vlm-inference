If the company makes 15 white cars in one day, how many blue cars will it make?\n\nA. 9\nB. 13\nC. 17\nD. 25\n\nassistant:To find the answer, we can set up a proportion.\n\nBlue cars / White cars = 5 / 3\n\nWe are given that the company makes 15 white cars, so we can set up the proportion:\n\nBlue cars / 15 = 5 / 3\n\nTo solve for Blue cars, we can cross-multiply:\n\nBlue cars * 15 = 15 * 5\n\nNow, divide both sides by 15:\n\nBlue cars = 15 * 5 / 15\n\nBlue cars = 5\n\nSo, the company will make 5 blue cars.
