Reaction formation\nC. Repression\nD. Sublimation\n\nassistant:The answer is B. Reaction formation.\n\nReaction formation is a defense mechanism where one's unconscious mind reacts to an unacceptable or unpleasant feeling by creating an opposite feeling. In this case, Janice is suppressing her feelings of hostility and contempt for her husband, and instead is expressing her love and care for him, creating an opposite feeling. This defense mechanism is called reaction formation because it creates a reaction or response to an unacceptable feeling.",
