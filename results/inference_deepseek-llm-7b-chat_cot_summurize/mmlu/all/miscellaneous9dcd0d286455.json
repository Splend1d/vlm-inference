Circle\nB. Triangle\nC. Hexagon\nD. Rectangle\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to determine which of the given geometric shapes is most commonly used to give strength to the structure of truss bridges.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question\nWe need to identify the shape that is most commonly used in truss bridges for strength.\n\nStep 2: Identify the shapes\nWe have the following shapes to choose from:\nA. Circle\nB. Triangle\nC. Hexagon\nD. Rectangle\n\nStep 3: Determine the most common shape\nTruss bridges are known for their strength and stability, and this is largely due to their unique structural design. The key elements of truss bridges are the triangular cross-members and diagonal bracing.\n\nStep 4: Justify the answer\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the most commonly used shape in truss bridges for strength is the triangle. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Triangle",
