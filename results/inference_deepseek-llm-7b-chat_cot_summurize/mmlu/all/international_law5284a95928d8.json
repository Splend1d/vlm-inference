Golder v UK (1978)\nB. A v UK (2009)\nC. Goodwin v UK (2002)\nD. Osman v UK (1998)\n\nassistant:The 'living instrument principle' is a concept that the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) uses to adapt its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to changing circumstances. This principle is based on the idea that the ECHR is a 'living instrument' that can evolve over time in response to new challenges and developments.\n\nLooking at the provided options, the case that best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the ECtHR is:\n\nA. Golder v UK (1978)\n\nIn this case, the ECtHR interpreted Article 6 of the ECHR, which deals with the right to a fair trial, to include the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. This interpretation was seen as a reflection of the evolving understanding of the importance of such a right in modern society.\n\nThe other options do not necessarily reflect the 'living instrument principle' in the same way. B. A v UK (2009) and C. Goodwin v UK (2002) both involve interpretations of specific provisions of the ECHR, but do not necessarily demonstrate a willingness to adapt the ECHR to changing circumstances. D. Osman v UK (1998) is not included in the options provided.",
