Air pollution from a power plant is blowing downwind and harming the trees in your community. Tax the production of electricity.\n\nA negative externality occurs when the costs of a firm's production are borne not only by the firm itself but also by third parties, such as neighboring communities or the environment. In this case, the power plant's emissions are causing harm to the trees in the community, which are not benefiting from the power plant's production.\n\nThe appropriate plan for eliminating this negative externality is to tax the production of electricity. This would encourage the power plant to reduce its emissions, as the cost of producing electricity would increase due to the added tax. The revenue generated from the tax can be used to compensate for the harm caused to the community, such as by investing in tree planting or environmental restoration projects.",
