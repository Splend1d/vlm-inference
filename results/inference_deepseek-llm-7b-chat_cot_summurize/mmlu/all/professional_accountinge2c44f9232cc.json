The company estimates that 5% of sales will be returned within the 90-day period. During the month, the company has sales of $200,000 and returns of sales made in prior months of $5,000. What amount should the company record as net sales revenue for new sales made during the month?\n\nA. $185,000\nB. $190,000\nC. $195,000\nD. $200,000\n\nassistant:To calculate the net sales revenue for the new sales made during the month, we first need to determine the total sales for the current month.\n\nTotal sales for the current month = Sales made during the current month + Sales made in prior months returned.\n\nTotal sales for the current month = $200,000 + $5,000 = $205,000\n\nNow, we need to consider the estimated returns for the current month.\n\nEstimated returns for the current month = Total sales for the current month * Return rate.\n\nEstimated returns for the current month = $205,000 * 0.05 = $10,250\n\nFinally, we calculate the net sales revenue for the new sales made during the month by subtracting the estimated returns from the total sales.\n\nNet sales revenue for new sales = Total sales for the current month - Estimated returns for the current month.\n\nNet sales revenue for new sales = $205,000 - $10,250 = $194,750\n\nThe company should record the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month as $194,750. Therefore, the correct answer is D. $200,000.",
