Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.\nD. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n\nUnder the First Amendment, private individuals have the right to engage in expressive activities, such as picketing. However, if the state is involved in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish between the state's action and the private actors' action, then the state may be held liable for any constitutional violations that occur.\n\nIn this case, the mall and the grocery store are both private actors, but the state is involved in the situation as well. The state owns the real estate on which the mall and the grocery store are located, and the state collects rent from the grocery store. Additionally, the state has a Social Security Office located in the mall. These connections between the state and the private actors make it difficult to distinguish between the state's action and the private actors' action.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to find that there is state action involved in this situation. This would mean that the grocery store and the mall owners could be held liable for any First Amendment violations that occur, such as the union's strike.",
