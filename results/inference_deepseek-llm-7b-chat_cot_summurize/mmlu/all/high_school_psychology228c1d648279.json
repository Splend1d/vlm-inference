His therapist taught him relaxation exercises to help him overcome his fear of flying. These exercises involved visualizing different stages of flying, such as looking at pictures of airplanes, watching them take off at the airport, and taking a short flight. Behavior therapy focuses on changing specific behaviors and patterns of thinking to improve one's emotional or mental state. Psychoanalysis, humanistic therapy, and existential therapy are different types of therapies that focus on different aspects of a person's experience and are not as closely tied to specific behavioral changes as behavior therapy.",
