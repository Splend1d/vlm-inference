At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\nB. No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the company\u00d5s promise was supported by consideration.\nD. Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\n\nUnder the principle of \"promissory estoppel,\" a party who promises to perform a future act that benefits the other party may be held to that promise even if there is no consideration for the promise. In this case, the builder promised to complete the project for $100 million, and the company relied on that promise to its detriment. However, the parties did not reduce the oral agreement to writing and sign it, which is a requirement for enforceability under most state laws. Therefore, the builder is unlikely to prevail in a lawsuit for the additional $1 million, because the modification of the contract was never reduced to writing and signed by the party to be charged.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. No, because there was consideration for the modification of the contract: The company agreed to pay an additional $1 million, which was consideration for the modification of the contract.\n\nC. Yes, because the company's promise was supported by consideration: The company promised to pay the additional $1 million, which was consideration for the modification of the contract.\n\nD. Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel: This answer is not relevant to the enforceability of the oral agreement. The issue is whether the oral agreement was reduced to writing and signed by the party to be charged, not whether the modification was fair and equitable.",
