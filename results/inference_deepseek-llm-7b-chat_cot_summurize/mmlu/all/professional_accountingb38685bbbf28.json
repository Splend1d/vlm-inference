If its average collection period was 36 days, its ending accounts receivable balance is closest to . (Assume a 365-day year.)\n\nA. $26.1 million\nB. $23.7 million\nC. $7.4 million\nD. $18.7 million\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to determine the ending accounts receivable balance for Kanji Company. We know that Kanji Company had sales of $265 million, and $25 million of that was cash sales. Therefore, the remaining sales, which were credit sales, were $240 million.\n\nWe also know that the average collection period was 36 days, and there are 365 days in a year. Therefore, the number of days in a year is 365, and the number of days in the average collection period is 36. The number of days in the credit sales is:\n\n$240 million \\* 36 days / 365 days = 240/365 \\* 36 days = 27.56 days\n\nThe ending accounts receivable balance is the credit sales minus the collection from the credit sales:\n\n$240 million - ($240 million \\* (365 days / 27.56 days)) = $240 million - $240 million \\* (12.39) = $240 million - $298.04 million\n\nThe ending accounts receivable balance is approximately $58.04 million.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is C. $7.4 million.",
