Mary must identify that number by asking \"yes/no\" questions of Bob. Mary knows that Bob always tells the truth. If Mary uses an optimal strategy, then she will determine the answer at the end of exactly how many questions in the worst case?\n\nA. 1,000\nB. 999\nC. 500\nD. 10\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of questions that Mary can ask Bob to determine the number he wrote down.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario. In this case, Bob will provide a number that is close to 1,000. We can think of this as a binary search problem, where Mary will ask \"yes\" or \"no\" questions to narrow down the possible numbers.\n\nLet's assume that Bob writes down a number N. Mary will start by asking two questions: \"Is your number greater than 500?\" If Bob answers \"yes\", Mary knows that the number is greater than 500, and she will ask a question to narrow down the possible numbers between 500 and 1,000. If Bob answers \"no\", Mary knows that the number is less than or equal to 500, and she will ask a question to narrow down the possible numbers between 1 and 500.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, Mary will have to ask one more question to determine the exact number N. So, the minimum number of questions that Mary can ask is 3 (two questions to narrow down the possible range, and one final question to determine the exact number).\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 10.",
