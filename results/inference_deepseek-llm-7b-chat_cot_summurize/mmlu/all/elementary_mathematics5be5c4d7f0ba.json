Mr. Kelly wants to put an equal number of rolls of paper towels into 4 rooms. He uses the number sentence below to find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room. 12 \ufffd t = 4 Which number sentence shows another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room?\n\nA. 4 \ufffd 12 = t\nB. 4 \u2013 t = 12\nC. 4 + 12 = t\nD. 4 \u00d7 t = 12\n\nassistant:To find another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls of paper towels he should put into each room, we can set up the equation 12 \ufffd t = 4. Now we need to find an equation that has the same solution.\n\nLet's try option A: 4 \ufffd 12 = t\n\nNow we need to solve for t:\n\nt = 4 \ufffd 12\nt = 1/3\n\nThis equation also gives us the same solution as the original equation, so it is another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls of paper towels he should put into each room.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 4 \ufffd 12 = t.",
