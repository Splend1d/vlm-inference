He baked 6 pies for his family and p pies for each of the 4 school fund-raisers. Which number sentence can be used to find the number of pies, p, Carl baked for each of the school fund-raisers?\n\nA. 6 \u00d7 p \u2013 18 = 4\nB. 18 \u2013 6 \u00d7 p = 4\nC. 4+6 \u00d7 p = 18\nD. 6+4 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nassistant:Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nCarl baked a total of 18 pies. He baked 6 pies for his family, so the number of pies for the school fund-raisers is 18 - 6 = 12.\n\nHe baked p pies for each of the 4 school fund-raisers. So, the number sentence we can use to find the number of pies, p, is:\n\n12 = 4 \u00d7 p\n\nNow, let's check the given options:\n\nA. 6 \u00d7 p \u2013 18 = 4\nB. 18 \u2013 6 \u00d7 p = 4\nC. 4+6 \u00d7 p = 18\nD. 6+4 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nOption A is not correct because the equation does not represent the number of pies for the school fund-raisers.\n\nOption B is not correct because it does not represent the total number of pies.\n\nOption C is not correct because it does not represent the total number of pies.\n\nOption D is correct because it represents the number of pies for the school fund-raisers, which is 4.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 6+4 \u00d7 p = 18.",
