If the machine is operating with a standard deviation in delivery equal to 0.3 ounce, what should be the mean setting so that a 12-ounce cup will overflow less than 1% of the time? Assume a normal distribution for ounces delivered.\n\nA. 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces\nB. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces\nC. 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces\nD. 12 + 2.326(0.3) ounces\n\nassistant:To determine the mean setting for the soft drink dispenser, we can use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the desired outcome (12 ounces), \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. We want to find the mean (\u03bc) such that the overflow probability is less than 1%.\n\nThe overflow probability can be calculated as:\n\nP(X > 12) = 1 - P(X \u2264 12) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01\n\nNow, we can set up the z-score formula for the desired overflow probability:\n\nz = (12 - \u03bc) / 0.3\n\nWe want to find the mean (\u03bc) such that z \u2264 -1.645 (since we want the overflow probability to be less than 0.01).\n\n-1.645 = (12 - \u03bc) / 0.3\n\nSolving for \u03bc:\n\n12 - \u03bc = -1.645 * 0.3\n12 - \u03bc = -0.4935\n\u03bc = 12 - 0.4935\n\u03bc \u2248 11.5065\n\nNow, we can calculate the overflow probability:\n\nP(X > 12) = P(z > -1.645) = P(z < 0.355)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that:\n\nP(z < 0.355) \u2248 0.0098\n\nSince we want the overflow probability to be less than 0.01, the mean setting should be:\n\n12 - 0.99(0.3) = 12 - 0.287 = 9.133\n\nThis answer is not among the given options, so there may be a mistake in the problem statement or in the provided options.",
