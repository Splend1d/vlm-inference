The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\n\nassistant:The passage describes how the plans for a housing scheme in Kingfield Street were deferred and later drastically curtailed by the Government's Housing Board. This change in plans was due to the Board's consideration of the Council's current commitments and the availability of funds at the time. The passage does not provide any information about welfare programs being questioned after the First World War, housing being a large part of the British budget, or the government Housing Board wanting to build more houses. Instead, it focuses on the changes in housing policies due to the changing economic and political circumstances after the war.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the plans being changed is that the government's housing policies were being adjusted in response to the changing economic and political circumstances after the First World War. This is most closely aligned with option A: \"Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\"\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
