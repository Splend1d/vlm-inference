Inputs are $100$-dimensional, and have several features such as the number of square feet, the median family income, etc. The first hidden layer has $1000$ activations. The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?\n\nA. 111021\nB. 110010\nC. 111110\nD. 110011\n\nassistant:To calculate the number of parameters in the network, we need to consider the number of input units, hidden units, and output units, as well as the number of parameters in the affine transformations and the bias terms.\n\nFor the first hidden layer, we have $100$ input units, $1000$ hidden units, and $1000$ weights and biases. The number of parameters in the first hidden layer is $100 \\times 1000 + 1000 = 100000 + 1000 = 101000$.\n\nFor the second hidden layer, we have $1000$ input units from the first hidden layer, $10$ hidden units, and $10 \\times 1000 = 10000$ weights and biases. The number of parameters in the second hidden layer is $10 \\times 10000 + 10000 = 100000 + 10000 = 110000$.\n\nThe output layer has $1$ output unit and $1 \\times 10000 = 10000$ weights and biases. The number of parameters in the output layer is $10000 + 1 = 10001$.\n\nAdding up the number of parameters in each layer, we have $101000 + 110000 + 10001 = 221001$.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in counting the number of parameters in the output layer. We should divide by the number of output units, which is $1$, to get the number of parameters in the output layer. Therefore, the correct number of parameters is $221001/1 = 221001$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{A. 111021}$.",
