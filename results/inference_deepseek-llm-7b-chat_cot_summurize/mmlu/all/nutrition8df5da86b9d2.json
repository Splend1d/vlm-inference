I will look for reliable sources of information about fats, such as scientific articles or books on biochemistry or nutrition.\n2. Once I find a reliable source, I will search for information about the composition of fats, specifically the concentration of triacylglycerols.\n3. I will compare the information I find with the answer choices provided and select the option that best matches the information I have found.\n\nAfter completing these steps, I found that the concentration of triacylglycerols in fats is typically around 90%. This means that fats generally contain triacylglycerols at concentrations of 90-95%. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 75-95%",
