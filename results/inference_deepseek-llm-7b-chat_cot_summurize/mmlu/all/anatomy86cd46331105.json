In medical terms, abduction refers to the movement of a body part away from the midline of the body. For the foot, this means moving it away from the midline of the leg, which is why option B (outward) is the correct answer. The other options (A, C, and D) are incorrect because they describe movements in the opposite direction of abduction.",
