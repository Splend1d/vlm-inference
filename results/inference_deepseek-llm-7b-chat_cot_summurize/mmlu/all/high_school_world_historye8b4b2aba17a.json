He enfolds the whole universe and in silence is loving to all. This is the Spirit that is in my heart, this is Brahman.

It is a polytheistic religion.\n\nassistant:The speaker's religion is described as Brahman, which is a term often used in Hinduism to refer to the ultimate reality or the supreme being. The quotation mentions that the Spirit, which is Brahman, enfolds the whole universe and is loving to all in silence. It also states that the speaker will come to Brahman when they go beyond this life. This suggests that the speaker's religion has an afterlife or an expectation of an afterlife.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is true of the speaker's religion is B. There is an expectation of an afterlife. The other options do not necessarily reflect the religion described in the quotation. Salvation is not mentioned, and while right actions and right speech may be valued in some Hindu traditions, they do not necessarily earn favor with the gods. Lastly, the quotation does not indicate that the religion is polytheistic, meaning it believes in multiple gods. Instead, it seems to refer to a higher, unifying power.",
