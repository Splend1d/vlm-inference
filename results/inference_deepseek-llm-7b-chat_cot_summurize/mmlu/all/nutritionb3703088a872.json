Bottle feeding is more appropriate for babies than breast feeding\n\nassistant:Option B is correct. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, solid foods should be introduced to babies at 4 to 6 months of age. This is because their digestive systems are still developing and they are not yet ready to eat solid food. It is important to introduce solid foods gradually and in small amounts, starting with single-grain cereals and moving on to other types of foods.\n\nIt is also important to note that breast milk or formula should continue to be the primary source of nutrition for babies up to 12 months of age or beyond.",
