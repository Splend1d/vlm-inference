At the beginning of the day, he had 152 roses. Mr. Kohlberg sold 96 of the roses and then wanted to separate the rest of the roses equally among 8 vases. What will be the total number of roses in each vase?\n\nA. 7\nB. 12\nC. 48\nD. 56\n\nassistant:To solve this problem, we need to find the number of roses Mr. Kohlberg has left after selling 96 roses. Then we need to divide the remaining roses equally among 8 vases.\n\n1. Calculate the number of roses left after selling:\n152 roses - 96 roses = 56 roses\n\n2. Divide the remaining roses equally among 8 vases:\n56 roses \ufffd 8 vases = 7 roses per vase\n\nSo the correct answer is A. 7 roses per vase.",
