Copper\nB. Carbon\nC. Germanium\nD. Silicon\n\nassistant:To determine which material has the least affected resistance by temperature changes, let's consider the properties of each option:\n\nA. Copper: Copper has a relatively high thermal coefficient of resistance, which means its resistance changes with temperature. However, it is a good conductor of electricity and has a low melting point.\n\nB. Carbon: Carbon is a good conductor of electricity and has a low thermal coefficient of resistance, which means its resistance changes with temperature. However, it is relatively brittle and can shatter easily.\n\nC. Germanium: Germanium has a low thermal coefficient of resistance, which means its resistance changes with temperature. It is also a semiconductor and has a high electrical conductivity.\n\nD. Silicon: Silicon is a semiconductor and has a low thermal coefficient of resistance, which means its resistance changes with temperature. It is also relatively inexpensive and has a high electrical conductivity.\n\nBased on these properties, it seems that silicon has the least affected resistance by temperature changes.",
