This argument emphasizes the severity of the state's unemployment problem and justifies the need for the statute to help alleviate this issue. It also suggests that the state has the right to enact laws that it believes will benefit its citizens, even if they may have an impact on interstate commerce. The other options do not directly address the commerce clause argument, and therefore are not as strong as option B.",
