However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)\n\nA. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\nB. Both fox and hare populations will increase.\nC. Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.\nD. Fox populations will increase and hare populations will decrease.\n\nassistant:To answer this question, let's go through the information given step by step and evaluate the possible outcomes for both the fox and hare populations.\n\n1. Red foxes are the primary predator of hares in Sweden. This means that, in the absence of other predators, the hare population will likely decrease due to predation by foxes.\n\n2. However, the mange mite is a fatal parasite that attacks red foxes. As mite population sizes increase, the number of healthy foxes will decrease. This could potentially lead to an increase in the hare population if the fox population decreases enough.\n\n3. Given that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes, the increase in the hare population will likely be due to the decrease in the fox population.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely outcome is that the hare population will increase while the fox population decreases. Therefore, the answer is C. Fox populations will decrease, and hare populations will increase.",
