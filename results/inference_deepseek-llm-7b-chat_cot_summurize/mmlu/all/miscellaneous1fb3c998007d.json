The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress on August 7, 1964, authorizing President Lyndon B. Johnson to take \"all necessary measures\" to retaliate against North Vietnam for attacks on American warships in the Gulf of Tonkin. This resolution was the legal basis for the escalation of United States involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nA. The declaration of war by Congress is not applicable, as the United States did not declare war on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\nC. A United Nations resolution condemning the North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam was not the legal basis for United States involvement in the war.\nD. Mutual defense provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) were not the legal basis for United States involvement in the Vietnam War.",
