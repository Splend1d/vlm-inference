When the capacitor is fully charged, it stores 600 \u03bcC of charge. An experimenter replaces the 2 \u03bcF capacitor with three 18 \u03bcF capacitors in series connected to the same battery. Once the capacitors are fully charged, what charge is stored on each capacitor?\n\nA. 100 \u03bcC\nB. 200 \u03bcC\nC. 600 \u03bcC\nD. 1800 \u03bcC\n\nassistant:Let's first find the equivalent capacitance of the three capacitors in series. The 18 \u03bcF capacitor has a capacitance of 18 \u03bcF = 18,000 \u03bcC. Since the capacitors are in series, the equivalent capacitance will be:\n\nequivalent capacitance = 18,000 + 18,000 + 18,000 = 54,000 \u03bcF\n\nNow, let's find the equivalent charge that will be stored on the three capacitors. The charge stored on a capacitor is given by:\n\ncharge = capacitance \u00d7 voltage\n\nSince the voltage across the capacitor remains the same during charging and discharging, we can set up the following equation:\n\n600 \u03bcC = 54,000 \u03bcF \u00d7 voltage\n\nSolving for voltage, we get:\n\nvoltage = 600 \u03bcC / 54,000 \u03bcF = 0.000109375 V\n\nNow we can find the charge stored on each capacitor:\n\ncharge = capacitance \u00d7 voltage\ncharge_1 = 2 \u03bcF \u00d7 0.000109375 V = 0.00022344 \u03bcC\ncharge_2 = 2 \u03bcF \u00d7 0.000109375 V = 0.00022344 \u03bcC\ncharge_3 = 2 \u03bcF \u00d7 0.000109375 V = 0.00022344 \u03bcC\n\nThe total charge stored on the three capacitors is 600 \u03bcC, which matches the original 2 \u03bcF capacitor. Therefore, the answer is C. 600 \u03bcC.",
