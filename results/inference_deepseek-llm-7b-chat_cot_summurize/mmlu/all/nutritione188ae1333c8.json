Glutamic acid\nB. Aspartic acid\nC. Palmitic acid\nD. Galactose\n\nassistant:D. Galactose cannot be a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is the metabolic pathway that produces glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors such as amino acids, fatty acids, and lactate. Among the options provided, Glutamic acid, Aspartic acid, and Palmitic acid can all serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis. Galactose, on the other hand, cannot be a substrate for gluconeogenesis because it is a carbohydrate and is already a source of glucose for the body.",
