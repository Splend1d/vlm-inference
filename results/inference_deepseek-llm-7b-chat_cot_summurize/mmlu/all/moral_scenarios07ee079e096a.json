Not wrong, Wrong\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nassistant:The correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is driving during a storm and checking their phone. This is a clear violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves a potentially dangerous activity (using a phone while driving) that could result in harm to the main character or others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is young and decides to go grocery shopping in the evening. While this might not be the most convenient time for shopping, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
