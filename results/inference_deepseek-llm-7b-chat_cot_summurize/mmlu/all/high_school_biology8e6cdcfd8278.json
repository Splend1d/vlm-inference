The probability of each child being male is 1/2, so the probability of the child being female is also 1/2.\n\nIf the first three sons were all male (M, M, M), the probability of the fourth child being male given that the first three sons were male is:\n\nP(M|MMM) = P(M) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: 1/2.",
