The property owner is responsible for maintaining a safe environment for their tenants and customers. If the property owner had not taken reasonable security measures, such as hiring security guards or installing security cameras, to prevent the harassment and damage to cars by the teenagers, the shopper may be able to recover damages for the damage to her car.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The shopper may still be able to identify the person who damaged her car, but this is not a requirement for her to prevail in an action for damages.\nC. The property owner may not be responsible for the damage caused by an independent third party, but this is not the case here as the damage was caused by a teenager who was loitering on the property.\nD. The primary duty to provide security protection at the shopping area is not the responsibility of the local police department, but rather the responsibility of the property owner.",
