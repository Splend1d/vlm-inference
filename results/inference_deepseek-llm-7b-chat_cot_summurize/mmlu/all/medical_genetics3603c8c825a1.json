X-linked dominant.\nD. X-linked recessive.\n\nassistant:The correct answer is A. autosomal dominant.\n\nMalignant hyperthermia is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to regulate temperature. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to develop the disorder.\n\nThe other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. autosomal recessive: This means that the person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the disorder.\nC. X-linked dominant: This means that the gene is located on the X chromosome and that males, who only have one X chromosome, would be more likely to develop the disorder than females, who have two X chromosomes and could potentially have a normal X chromosome.\nD. X-linked recessive: This means that the gene is located on the X chromosome and that both copies of the gene need to be mutated for the disorder to develop.",
