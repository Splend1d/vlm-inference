Little argues that we should accept a prerogative on the part of mothers to end a pregnancy until the fetus is a person because we should accept a prerogative to decline radical changes to one's practical identity. This is based on the idea that the mother's practical identity is centered around her ability to care for her own life, and that forcing her to continue a pregnancy would be a radical change to her practical identity.\n\nB. is incorrect because Little does not argue that abortion is absolutely morally wrong.\nC. is incorrect because Little does not argue that abortion is presumptively morally wrong but can become permissible in certain extreme cases.\nD. is incorrect because Little does not argue that there is no clear answer about the moral status of abortion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
