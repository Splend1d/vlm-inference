One student's time had a standardized score of z = 2.40. If the times are all changed to minutes, what will then be the student's standardized score?\n\nA. z = 0.04\nB. z = 0.4\nC. z = 1.80\nD. z = 2.40\n\nassistant:To find the new standardized score when the times are changed from seconds to minutes, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes and then calculate the new standardized score.\n\nFirst, convert the time from seconds to minutes:\nTime in seconds = 2.40\nTime in minutes = 2.40 / 60 = 0.04\n\nNow, use the formula for a standardized score:\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere:\nx = time in minutes (0.04)\n\u03bc = mean time in minutes (not given)\n\u03c3 = standard deviation of time in minutes (not given)\n\nSince we don't have the mean and standard deviation of the original times, we can't directly calculate the standardized score. However, we can compare the original and new standardized scores:\n\nOriginal z = 2.40\nNew z = 0.04\n\nSince 0.04 is much smaller than 2.40, it's clear that the new standardized score is much lower than the original score. We can't determine the exact value of the new z, but we know it is much smaller than 2.40. Among the options provided, none of them accurately represent the new z value, so the correct answer is:\n\nA. z = 0.04",
