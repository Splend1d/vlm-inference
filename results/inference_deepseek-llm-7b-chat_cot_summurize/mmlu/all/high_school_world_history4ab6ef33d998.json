The other options, such as the machine gun, joint-stock company, and steam-powered ships, all played significant roles in Europe's military and economic power during this time, which allowed them to expand their influence and control over Africa. However, the development of vaccines for tropical diseases would have indirectly benefited Europeans who traveled to Africa, as it reduced the risk of disease and death among European traders and colonizers.",
