It is reasonable to conduct suspicionless testing of employees who are involved in drug interdiction or the handling of firearms.\nD. It is reasonable for a government employer to conduct suspicionless searches under any circumstances.\n\nassistant:The Supreme Court ultimately decided to side with the federal employees union. The court ruled that the mandatory drug testing policy, which required federal employees who carried firearms or interdicted drugs in their official duties to undergo urine specimens for analysis, violated the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy and the right to be free from unreasonable searches. The court held that such searches were not conducted for a legitimate purpose and that the employees involved had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nThe court's decision was based on the idea that suspicionless testing of employees without probable cause or suspicion is an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The court also emphasized that such testing does not contribute to the safety or security of the workplace or the public.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The drug testing policy is unconstitutional because the searches are made without probable cause or suspicion.",
