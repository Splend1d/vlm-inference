While this may be seen as selfish, it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is trying to determine if the fruit is ripe enough by biting into it. While this is not the most hygienic way to check for ripeness, it is not morally wrong.",
