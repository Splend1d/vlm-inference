An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes\nC. An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes\nD. An inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes\n\nassistant:The correct answer is B. An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nFor a myopic person, their eye's lens is too strong, causing light rays to focus in front of the retina, resulting in a blurred image of distant objects. When they wear corrective lenses, the lenses counteract the eye's natural lens by reducing the amount of lens power, causing the light rays to focus on the retina instead of in front of it. This creates an upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of the person's eyes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a virtual image is an inverted image, which is not the case here. Option C is also incorrect because an inverted image is not the case for a myopic person. Option D is incorrect because the distance between the image and the retina is incorrect.",
