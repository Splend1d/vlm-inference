The union has not followed the procedure outlined in the ordinance, which requires applications to be filed at least three days before the picketing is intended to begin and to state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing.\n\nThe court is likely to grant relief to the school board because the teachers union failed to follow the procedure outlined in the ordinance. The court may also consider whether the ordinance is constitutional, but the union's failure to follow the required procedures is likely to be the primary reason for granting relief to the school board.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. grant relief, because the teachers union failed to follow the procedure outlined in the ordinance.",
