In this case, the mother is suing the neighbor for causing emotional distress, even though she was not present when the threat was made. However, the mother is still the victim of the neighbor's actions and can recover financially from the neighbor's actions. The other options are incorrect because they either disregard the mother's emotional distress or do not consider the fact that she is a victim in the situation.",
