Therefore, we cannot determine which of the options is the correct answer based on the information provided. The passage only discusses the situation during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879 and the damage caused by a contingent of 1,500 natives to the British citizen's homestead.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we would need to consult additional information or resources that discuss the reasons why European citizens moved to Zulu lands in 1867.",
