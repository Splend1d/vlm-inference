A line-item veto\nB. A pocket veto\nC. An adjournment\nD. A writ of certiorari\n\nassistant:A pocket veto would occur.\n\nA pocket veto occurs when a president fails to sign a bill passed by Congress within the ten-day period after the end of a session of Congress. In this case, if Congress were to pass legislation and declare a recess, and the president took no action on the bill within ten days of its passage, the president would not have enough time to sign the bill before the end of the session, resulting in a pocket veto.\n\nA line-item veto, a pocket veto, and a writ of certiorari are all powers or legal processes related to the president's role in the legislative process, but they are distinct from an adjournment. An adjournment is a temporary suspension of a legislative session, which would not be triggered by the events described in the question.",
