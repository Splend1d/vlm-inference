Abigail Adams\nB. Sandra Day O'Connor\nC. Jane Addams\nD. Rosa Parks\n\nassistant:Geraldine Ferraro, the daughter of working-class immigrants, is often compared to Abigail Adams, the wife of one of America's founding fathers. Both women were strong advocates for their families and for the rights of women and working-class individuals.\n\nAbigail Adams was the wife of John Adams, the second president of the United States, and a strong supporter of women's rights. She wrote letters to her husband, urging him to include women's rights in the new constitution, and advocating for equal rights for all citizens.\n\nGeraldine Ferraro, on the other hand, was the first woman and the first Italian-American to be nominated as a vice presidential candidate by a major political party in the United States. She was a fierce advocate for women's rights and working-class individuals, and argued that the rules of American life should work for all Americans, not just a privileged few.\n\nSandra Day O'Connor, Jane Addams, and Rosa Parks are all important figures in American history, but they do not share the same experiences or values as Geraldine Ferraro. Sandra Day O'Connor was the first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and a strong advocate for gender equality. Jane Addams was a social reformer and the first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, advocating for the rights of women and working-class individuals. Rosa Parks was a civil rights activist who refused to give up her seat on a bus, sparking the civil rights movement in the United States.\n\nIn conclusion, Geraldine Ferraro can most directly be compared to Abigail Adams, as both women were strong advocates for women's rights and working-class individuals, and both fought for the rights of their fellow citizens.",
