You are able to understand the visual content that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language.\n\nuser: Let T: R^2 -> R^2 be the linear transformation that maps the point (1, 2) to (2, 3) and the point (-1, 2) to (2, -3). Then T maps the point (2, 1) to\n\nA. (1, 6)\nB. (-1, 4)\nC. (3, 2)\nD. (-4, 3)\n\nassistant:We can represent the linear transformation T as a matrix. Let A = [(a, b), (c, d)], where (a, b) maps to (2, 3) and (c, d) maps to (2, -3). Then we have:\n\n(2, 3) = A(1, 2) = (a, b)(1, 2)\n(2, -3) = A(-1, 2) = (c, d)(-1, 2)\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n(a, b) = [2, 3]\n(c, d) = [-2, 3]\n\nSo T maps (2, 1) to A(2, 1) = (2, -1) = (2, 3) - (2, 1) = [2, 3] - [2, 1] = [1, 2]. Then T maps (1, 2) to A(1, 2) = (2, 3) - (1, 2) = [1, 2] - [2, 1] = [-1, 4].\n\nTherefore, T maps (2, 1) to (-1, 4).\n\nThe answer is B.",
