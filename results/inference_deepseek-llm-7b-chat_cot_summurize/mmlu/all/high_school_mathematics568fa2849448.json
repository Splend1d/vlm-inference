What is the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x^{11}$?\n\nA. 9\nB. 55\nC. 21\nD. 11\n\nassistant:To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers. Since $107$ and $109$ are prime numbers, their only factors are $1$ and themselves. Therefore, we can write $107 = 1 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$ and $109 = 1 \\cdot 109$.\n\nNow, let's find the prime factorization of $x^{11}$:\n$x^{11} = (107 \\cdot 109^5)^{11}$\n\nTo find the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x^{11}$, we need to find the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $107 \\cdot 109^5$ and multiply it by $11$.\n\n$107 = 7 \\cdot 11$\n$109 = 109$\n\n$107 \\cdot 109^5 = (7 \\cdot 11) \\cdot (109^5)$\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent of $109$ in $(7 \\cdot 11) \\cdot (109^5)$.\n\n$109^5 = 109 \\cdot 109 \\cdot 109 \\cdot 109 \\cdot 109$\n\nWe can rewrite this as $(109 \\cdot 109)^4$.\n\n$(7 \\cdot 11) \\cdot (109^5) = (7 \\cdot 11) \\cdot ((109 \\cdot 109)^4)$\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent of $109$ in $(109 \\cdot 109)^4$.\n\n$(109 \\cdot 109)^4 = (109 \\cdot 109)^2 \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109)$\n\nWe can rewrite this as $(109 \\cdot 109)^2 \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109)$.\n\n$(109 \\cdot 109)^2 \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109) = (109 \\cdot 109)^2 \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109)$\n\nNow, we have $(109 \\cdot 109)^2 \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109)$.\n\n$(109 \\cdot 109)^2 \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109) = (109^2) \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109)$\n\nNow, we can find the exponent of $109$ in $(109^2) \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109)$.\n\n$(109^2) \\cdot (109 \\cdot 109) = (109 \\cdot 109)^2$\n\nWe can see that the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x^{11}$ is the same as the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $107 \\cdot 109^5$, which is $55$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$.",
