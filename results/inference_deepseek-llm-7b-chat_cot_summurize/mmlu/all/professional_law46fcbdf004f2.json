The developer's obligation to repay the loan is conditioned on his entering into a contract with a builder for the construction of the shopping center on the three-acre tract. This means that the developer's obligation to repay the loan is subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. a condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.",
