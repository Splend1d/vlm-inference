RoBERTa, a variant of BERT, was trained on a corpus that was approximately 10 times larger than the corpus used to train BERT. Statement 2 is also true. In 2018, ResNeXts (a type of neural network architecture) usually used the hyperbolic tangent activation function, which is the tanh function mentioned in statement 2.",
