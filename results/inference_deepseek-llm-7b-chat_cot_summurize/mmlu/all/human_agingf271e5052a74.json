Green cemetery.\n\nA green cemetery is a type of burial site where the body is allowed to decompose naturally without a casket. This type of cemetery is also known as natural burial, natural death, or woodland burial. In a green cemetery, the body is placed in a biodegradable container and buried in a shallow grave. The grave is then covered with a biodegradable shroud or a layer of organic material, such as leaves or wood chips, which helps to break down the body naturally. This method of burial is considered more eco-friendly than traditional casket burials, as it reduces the amount of chemicals and materials used in the process.",
