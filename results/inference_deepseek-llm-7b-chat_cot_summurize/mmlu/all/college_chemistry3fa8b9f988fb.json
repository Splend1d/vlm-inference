What is the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations: |pe / pH| ?\n\nA. [|\u0263e| = 1.761 x 10^11 T^-1 s^-1]\nB. 820\nC. 658\nD. 329\n\nassistant:To find the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations of the electron and proton in a magnetic field, we can use the Biot-Savart Law and Ampere's Law.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnetic moment of the electron and proton. The magnetic moment is given by:\n\n\u03bc = q * v * |r|\n\nwhere \u03bc is the magnetic moment, q is the charge, v is the velocity, and |r| is the magnitude of the position vector.\n\nFor the electron, \u03bc = -|\u0263e| * |v| * |r|\n\nFor the proton, \u03bc = +|\u0263p| * |v| * |r|\n\nwhere |\u0263e| = 1.761 x 10^11 T^-1 s^-1 is the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron, and |\u0263p| = 1.672 x 10^-27 kg m/s is the charge-to-mass ratio of the proton.\n\nNow, let's find the magnetic field due to the electron and proton. Using the Biot-Savart Law:\n\nB = (\u03bc / (4 * \u03c0 * |r|^3)) * (By - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202x - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202y)\n\nwhere By and Bz are the magnetic fields in the y and z directions, respectively, and \u2202r / \u2202x and \u2202r / \u2202y are the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to x and y.\n\nFor the electron, B = - |\u0263e| * |v| * |r| / (4 * \u03c0 * |r|^3) * (By - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202x - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202y)\n\nFor the proton, B = + |\u0263p| * |v| * |r| / (4 * \u03c0 * |r|^3) * (By - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202x - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202y)\n\nNow, let's find the equilibrium polarization of the electron and proton. The equilibrium polarization is given by:\n\npe = (By - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202x - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202y) * |r|\n\npH = (By - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202x - Bz * \u2202r / \u2202y) * |r|\n\nFinally, the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations is:\n\npe / pH = |pe / pH|\n\nUsing the values from the problem, we get:\n\n|pe / pH| = 1.761 x 10^11 T^-1 s^-1\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",
