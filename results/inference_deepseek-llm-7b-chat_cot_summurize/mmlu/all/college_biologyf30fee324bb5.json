Eukarya utilize the general transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TFIIB in transcription, whereas Bacteria do not.

Bacteria and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Archaea.\nD. Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria diverged simultaneously from a common ancestor.\n\nassistant:The question presents information about the three major domains of life: Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria. It states that Eukarya utilize the general transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TFIIB in transcription, while Bacteria do not. It also mentions that at least one member of Archaea has a protein similar to TBP and a protein similar to TFIIB.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely scenario is that Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria. This is because Eukarya have the transcription factors TBP and TFIIB, which are not present in Bacteria. This suggests that Eukarya and Archaea diverged from a common ancestor that had these transcription factors, while Bacteria did not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria.",
