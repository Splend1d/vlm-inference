Lincoln's election on a Free-Soil platform led Southern politicians to conclude that secession was necessary.\n\nassistant:D. Lincoln's election on a Free-Soil platform led Southern politicians to conclude that secession was necessary.\n\nSouth Carolina chose to secede from the Union in 1860 due to concerns about the future of slavery in the United States. The Republican party, which Lincoln belonged to, had announced that they would wage war against slavery until it ceased throughout the United States. This announcement was a significant concern for the Southern states, who depended heavily on the institution of slavery for their economy.\n\nThe passage you provided quotes the Republican party's plans to exclude the South from the common territory, make the judicial tribunal sectional, and wage war against slavery. These plans were seen as a direct threat to the rights and interests of the Southern states. Consequently, the Southern states felt that they had no choice but to secede in order to protect their way of life.\n\nThe other options you listed - the Compromise of 1850, the Battle of Fort Sumter, and the Emancipation Proclamation - were not the primary reasons for South Carolina's decision to secede. The Compromise of 1850 was an attempt to resolve some of the issues dividing the North and the South, but it did not ultimately prevent the secession. The Battle of Fort Sumter was an event that triggered public outrage, but it was not the direct cause of secession. The Emancipation Proclamation was a significant event for the abolition of slavery, but it was not a direct factor in South Carolina's decision to secede.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary reason for South Carolina's decision to secede was the election of President Lincoln on a Free-Soil platform, which led Southern politicians to believe that their rights and interests were under threat, and thus, secession was necessary.",
