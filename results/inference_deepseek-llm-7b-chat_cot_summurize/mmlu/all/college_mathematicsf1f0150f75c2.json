None\nB. One\nC. Two\nD. Three\n\nassistant:The given polynomial is 2x^5 + 8x - 7. To determine the number of real roots, we can use the Rational Root Theorem and factor the polynomial.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is -7 and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of -7 are \u00b11, \u00b17, and the factors of 2 are \u00b11, \u00b12. So the possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b17, \u00b11/2, and \u00b114.\n\nBy testing these possible rational roots, we find that x = -1/2 is a root (2(-1/2)^5 + 8(-1/2) - 7 = 0). Therefore, the polynomial has at least one real root.\n\nSo the answer is B. One real root.",
