Subsequently, the woman sued the driver of the vehicle to recover damages for her injuries. At trial, the woman calls a police officer to testify that a few minutes after the accident, a driver stopped him and said, \"Hey, officer, I just saw an accident involving a red truck that hit this girl who was riding a bicycle. The truck left the scene of the accident and I followed it to a warehouse. \" The police officer then testified that he immediately drove to the warehouse and saw the defendant sitting in a red truck that was parked in the lot.

According to the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay is a statement that is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the driver's statement was not made during the trial but rather a few minutes after the accident. Therefore, it is considered hearsay.\n\nHearsay is generally inadmissible in court unless it falls within a recognized exception. One exception is the present sense impression exception, which allows a witness to testify to their own memory of an event that occurred before the witness took the stand. However, in this case, the police officer did not testify that he heard the driver's statement at the time it was made, but rather testified to what the driver told him a few minutes after the accident. Therefore, the present sense impression exception does not apply.\n\nAnother exception is the statement of recent perception, which allows a witness to testify to their own memory of an event that occurred within a short period of time before the witness took the stand. In this case, the driver's statement was made a few minutes after the accident, and the police officer testified to what the driver told him a short time later. However, this exception does not apply because the statement was not made within a short period of time before the witness took the stand.\n\nIn conclusion, the police officer's testimony regarding the driver's statement should be inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
