Similarly, a fabric factory periodically checks the sizes of towels coming off an assembly line and halts production if measurements are sufficiently off target. In both situations, we have the null hypothesis that the equipment is performing satisfactorily. For each situation, which is the more serious concern, a Type I or Type II error?\n\nA. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type I error\nB. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type II error\nC. Dialysis center: Type II error, towel manufacturer: Type I error\nD. Dialysis center: Type II error, towel manufacturer: Type II error\n\nassistant:In the dialysis center situation, the null hypothesis is that the equipment is performing satisfactorily. If the equipment is performing satisfactorily and the readings are sufficiently off target, a Type I error occurs when we conclude that the equipment is not performing satisfactorily when it actually is. In other words, we falsely reject the null hypothesis.\n\nIn the towel manufacturer situation, the null hypothesis is that the equipment is performing satisfactorily. If the equipment is performing satisfactorily and the measurements are sufficiently off target, a Type II error occurs when we fail to conclude that the equipment is not performing satisfactorily when it actually is not. In other words, we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\n\nTherefore, the more serious concern in the dialysis center situation is a Type I error, while the more serious concern in the towel manufacturer situation is a Type II error. So, the answer is A. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type I error.",
