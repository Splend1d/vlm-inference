Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it; either party may end up with the superior deal depending on luck, knowledge and variety of factors.\n\nThe seller should have acted more reasonably in this situation. Before selling the etching, he should have had it appraised to determine its true value. Since he did not take reasonable steps to protect himself, he cannot now rescind the contract or seek damages for the difference in value. The buyer's defense that the seller did not act reasonably is sufficient to dismiss the seller's complaint.",
