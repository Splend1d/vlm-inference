The nascent chain is located within the ribosome (labeled as A).\n3. The ribonucleoprotein particle is associated with the ribosome, indicating that the nascent chain is being synthesized.\n\nGiven this information, the nascent chain is being synthesized at the ribosome. The ribonucleoprotein particle is likely a messenger RNA (mRNA) that is being translated into a protein. The nascent chain is the growing protein being synthesized on the ribosome.\n\nAfter synthesis, the nascent chain typically moves to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for further processing. From there, it can be transported to the Golgi apparatus for modification and packaging before being sent to the extracellular space or other cellular compartments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. cytosol to the extracellular space"
