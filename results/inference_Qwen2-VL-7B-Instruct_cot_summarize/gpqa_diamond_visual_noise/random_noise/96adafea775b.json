This equation assumes that the current is limited by the mobility of the charge carriers and the presence of traps is negligible.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.\n- This option matches the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, which is derived for such conditions.\n\nB. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.\n- A Schottky contact implies a barrier at the contact, which violates the assumption of no carrier injection barrier.\n\nC. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.\n- The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for a single-carrier device, not a two-carrier device.\n\nD. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.\n- An Ohmic contact implies a barrier at the contact, which violates the assumption of no carrier injection barrier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
