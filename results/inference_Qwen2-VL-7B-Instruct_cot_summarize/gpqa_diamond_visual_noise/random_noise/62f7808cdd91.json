Toluene (C7H8) is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.\n2. Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.\n3. Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.\n\nLet's break down the reactions step by step:\n\n1. Toluene (C7H8) is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to form nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2).\n2. Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to form benzoic acid (C6H5COOH).\n3. Benzoic acid (C6H5COOH) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form sodium benzoate (C6H5COONa).\n\nNow, let's analyze the molecular structure of sodium benzoate (C6H5COONa):\n\n- Sodium benzoate has the molecular formula C6H5COONa.\n- The structure consists of a benzene ring (C6H5) with a carboxyl group (COOH) and a sodium ion (Na+).\n\nThe molecular structure of sodium benzoate is symmetrical around the benzene ring. The carboxyl group is attached to one side of the benzene ring, and the sodium ion is attached to the other side.\n\nGiven this symmetry, the molecular symmetry group of sodium benzoate is:\n\nC2h\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
