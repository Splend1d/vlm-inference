Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation of each atom:**\n   - Carbon (C): Enthalpy of atomization = 1000 kJ/mol\n   - Hydrogen (H): Enthalpy of atomization = 100 kJ/mol (since H is a diatomic molecule, we consider the bond energy as the enthalpy of atomization)\n\n2. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound:**\n   - The compound has 14 carbon atoms and 28 hydrogen atoms.\n   - The enthalpy of formation of the compound is the sum of the enthalpies of formation of all the atoms minus the enthalpy of formation of the compound.\n\n   Let's calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound step by step:\n\n   - **Carbon (C):**\n     - There are 14 carbon atoms.\n     - Enthalpy of formation = 14 * 1000 kJ/mol = 14000 kJ/mol\n\n   - **Hydrogen (H):**\n     - There are 28 hydrogen atoms.\n     - Enthalpy of formation = 28 * 100 kJ/mol = 2800 kJ/mol\n\n   - **Total enthalpy of formation of the compound:**\n     - Total enthalpy = 14000 kJ/mol (carbon) + 2800 kJ/mol (hydrogen) = 16800 kJ/mol\n\n   - **Bond energies:**\n     - C-C bond energy = 200 kJ/mol\n     - C=C bond energy = 300 kJ/mol\n     - C-H bond energy = 400 kJ/mol\n\n   - **Calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies:**\n     - The compound has 14 C-C bonds, 4 C=C bonds, and 28 C-H bonds.\n     - Enthalpy of formation = 14 * 200 kJ/mol (C-C) + 4 * 300 kJ/mol (C=C) + 28 * 400 kJ/mol (C-H)\n     - Enthalpy of formation = 2800 kJ/mol (C-C) + 1200 kJ/mol (C=C) + 11200 kJ/mol (C-H)\n     - Enthalpy of formation = 15200 kJ/mol\n\n   - **Difference between the two calculations:**\n     - Difference = 16800 kJ/mol (from atomization) - 15200 kJ/mol (from bond energies) = 1600 kJ/mol\n\n   - **Final enthalpy of formation:**\n     - Final enthalpy of formation = 15200 kJ/mol (from bond energies) + 1600 kJ/mol (difference) = 16800 kJ/mol\n\nTherefore, the enthalpy of formation of the given compound is 16800 kJ/mol.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 11200 kJ/mol"
