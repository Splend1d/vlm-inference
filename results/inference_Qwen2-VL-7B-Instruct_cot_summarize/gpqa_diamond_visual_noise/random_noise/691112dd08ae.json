Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?\n\nA. loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype\nB. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype\nC. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\nD. change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype\n"

This would result in a loss-of-function phenotype for the wild-type allele, as the wild-type protein would be unable to form functional dimers and thus be unable to shuttle into the nucleus and serve in gene transcription. Therefore, the correct answer is C. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\nThe other options are less likely because:\n\nA. Loss of protein dimerization is not a typical outcome of a dominant-negative mutation.\nB. Protein aggregation is not a direct consequence of a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.\nD. A gain-of-function phenotype is not expected from a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
