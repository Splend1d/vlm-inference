Triisopropyl borate\n- This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups. The structure does not exhibit threefold rotational symmetry or a horizontal mirror plane.\n\nB. Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone\n- This molecule has a central ring structure with three phenyl rings arranged in a way that suggests threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane. This structure matches the \\(C_3h\\) symmetry.\n\nC. Quinuclidine\n- Quinuclidine has a nitrogen atom at the center with four substituents. It does not exhibit threefold rotational symmetry or a horizontal mirror plane.\n\nD. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\n- This molecule has a central ring structure with three furan rings arranged in a way that suggests threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane. This structure matches the \\(C_3h\\) symmetry.\n\nBoth options B and D exhibit \\(C_3h\\) symmetry. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, and both options are correct, the correct answer is:\n\nB. triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone\n\nThis molecule specifically matches the \\(C_3h\\) symmetry criteria."
