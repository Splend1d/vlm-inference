The spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio and three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\nA. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\n- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups (CH3) at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n- 1,4-diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups (C2H5) at positions 1 and 4.\n\nB. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nC. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n- 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nD. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n- 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nNow, let's analyze the signals:\n\n- The two signals at around 6.7 ppm (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio suggest two different aromatic rings. This is consistent with the presence of two different tetramethylbenzenes.\n- The three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest two different alkyl groups. This is consistent with the presence of two different alkyl groups (ethyl and methyl).\n\nGiven the options, the most likely combination is:\n\nB. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nThese two compounds have the required number of signals and their positions match the observed signals in the spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene"
