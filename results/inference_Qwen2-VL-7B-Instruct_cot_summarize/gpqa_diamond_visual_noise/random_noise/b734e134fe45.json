This can be related to the Lorentz factor through the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\):\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta_c) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\n\\]\n\nFor one-third of the particles to reach the walls, the probability of a particle not reaching the walls is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{not}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the Lorentz factor for one-third of the particles to reach the walls is:\n\\[\n\\gamma_1 = 3\n\\]\n\nFor two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls, the probability of a particle not reaching the walls is:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{not}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the Lorentz factor for two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls is:\n\\[\n\\gamma_2 = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
