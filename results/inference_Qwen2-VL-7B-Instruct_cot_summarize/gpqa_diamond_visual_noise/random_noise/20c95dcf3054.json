The Lyman alpha wavelength is approximately 1216 Angstroms. \n\nThe redshift \\( z \\) can be related to the wavelength shift using the formula:\n\\[ \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{em}} (1 + z) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\) is the observed wavelength,\n- \\( \\lambda_{\\text{em}} \\) is the emitted wavelength,\n- \\( z \\) is the redshift.\n\nGiven that the emitted wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{em}} \\) is 1216 Angstroms and the observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\) is also 1216 Angstroms (since the light is absorbed and not shifted), we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 1216 (1 + z) = 1216 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( z \\):\n\\[ 1 + z = 1 \\]\n\\[ z = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, this result indicates that there is no redshift, which is not the case for the objects in the image. The objects in the image appear to be highly redshifted due to the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 1.9\nB. 2.4\nC. 3\nD. 1.2\n\nThe correct answer is likely to be higher than 1.9, as the objects appear to be highly redshifted. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate is:\n\nC. 3"
