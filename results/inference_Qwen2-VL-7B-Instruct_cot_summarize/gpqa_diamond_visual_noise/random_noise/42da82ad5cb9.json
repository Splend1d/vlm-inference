This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>\n\nA.

To eliminate the compound, we need to change the `TTT` codon to a different codon that does not encode the same amino acid or any amino acid at all.\n\n- **Mutant 1:** Changes `TTT` to `TAC`, which is a different codon.\n- **Mutant 2:** Changes `TTT` to `AAG`, which is a different codon.\n- **Mutant 3:** Changes `TTT` to `TAC`, which is a different codon.\n- **Mutant 4:** Changes `TTT` to `ACT`, which is a different codon.\n\nAll the mutations change the `TTT` codon to different codons. However, the most straightforward change that would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is to change the `TTT` codon to a stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`), which would terminate translation and prevent the synthesis of the compound.\n\nGiven the options, **Mutant 3** changes `TTT` to `TAC`, which is a different codon but does not necessarily stop translation.\n\n**Mutant 4** changes `TTT` to `ACT`, which is also a different codon but does not necessarily stop translation.\n\n**Mutant 1** changes `TTT` to `TAC`, which is a different codon but does not necessarily stop translation.\n\n**Mutant 2** changes `TTT` to `AAG`, which is a different codon but does not necessarily stop translation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is one that changes the `TTT` codon to a stop codon.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n**A.
