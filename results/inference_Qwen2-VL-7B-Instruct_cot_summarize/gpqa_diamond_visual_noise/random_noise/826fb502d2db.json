However, the question asks for the total energy of the system, which is not directly provided by the given options. The options provided seem to be incorrect or incomplete, as they do not match the calculated relative speed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the calculations, the relative speed of the system is approximately \\( 0.846c \\), which is not listed among the provided options. Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given choices.\n\nHowever, if we were to choose the closest option based on the calculations, it would be:\n\nD. \\( v_{\\text{rel}} = 0.14c \\), \\( E = 5.96 mc^2 \\)\n\nThis option is incorrect based on the calculations, but it is the closest match among the provided choices."
