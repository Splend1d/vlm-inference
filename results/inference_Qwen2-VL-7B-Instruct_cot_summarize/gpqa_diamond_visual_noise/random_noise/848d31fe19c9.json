Therefore, the probability that the atom will not decay in the next 150 minutes (remaining 100 minutes) is:\n\\[ 0.68 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. This is the complement of the probability that it will not decay:\n\\[ 1 - 0.68 = 0.32 \\]\n\nSo, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is 32%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 40%"
