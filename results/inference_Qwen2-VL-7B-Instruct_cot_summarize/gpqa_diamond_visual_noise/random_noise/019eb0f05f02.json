                    "text": "To determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to understand the concept of optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, also known as chirality, occurs when molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in their three-dimensional structure. This results in molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are therefore optically active.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n   - This compound has a benzene ring structure with multiple substituents. The presence of multiple substituents on the benzene ring can lead to different spatial arrangements, potentially resulting in optical isomers.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n   - This compound is a simple ester with a hydroxyl group. It does not have a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), so it cannot exist as an optical isomer.\n\n3. **benzophenone**\n   - Benzophenone has a benzene ring with a ketone group. It does not have a chiral center, so it cannot exist as an optical isomer.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate**\n   - This compound has a fumarate group with two methyl groups. The fumarate group itself is chiral due to the presence of a double bond, which can lead to different spatial arrangements and thus optical isomers.\n\nGiven this analysis, the compounds that show optical isomerism are:\n\n- dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n- dimethyl fumarate\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 1, 2 and 4**"
