The product of this reaction is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n2. **BH3 + H+**: This is another reducing agent that can also reduce ketones to alcohols. The product of this reaction is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nGiven that both reactions result in the same product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, we need to determine which starting material would lead to these products.\n\n- For the reaction with LiBH4 + H+, the starting material must be a ketone.\n- For the reaction with BH3 + H+, the starting material must also be a ketone.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n- Both are the same compound.
