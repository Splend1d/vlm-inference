                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B based on the given information. Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Heating the mixture to 200\u00b0C:**\n   - Only a mixture of gases is formed.\n   - These gases are passed through three tubes: anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (tube \u21161), Ca(OH)2 solution (tube \u21162), and red-hot copper (tube \u21163).\n\n2. **Results:**\n   - Tube \u21161 (Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60 g.\n   - Tube \u21163 (red-hot copper) gained 0.80 g (CuO formed).\n   - Tube \u21162 (Ca(OH)2 solution) did not change in weight.\n   - 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\n\n3. **Analysis of the results:**\n   - Tube \u21161 gained 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms gained by the reaction with Mg(ClO4)2.\n   - Tube \u21163 gained 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms gained by the reaction with red-hot copper.\n   - Tube \u21162 did not change in weight, indicating that no significant reaction occurred with Ca(OH)2.\n\n4. **Mass of oxygen atoms gained:**\n   - Tube \u21161: 3.60 g (O atoms)\n   - Tube \u21163: 0.80 g (O atoms)\n\n5. **Total mass of oxygen atoms:**\n   - Total mass of oxygen atoms = 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g\n\n6. **Moles of oxygen atoms:**\n   - Moles of oxygen atoms = mass / molar mass\n   - Molar mass of oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol\n   - Moles of oxygen atoms = 4.40 g / 16 g/mol = 0.275 mol\n\n7. **Moles of other atoms:**\n   - Since the salts A and B are equimolar, the number of moles of other atoms is equal to the number of moles of oxygen atoms.\n   - Moles of other atoms = 0.275 mol\n\n8. **Total number of atoms:**\n   - Total number of atoms = moles of oxygen atoms + moles of other atoms\n   - Total number of atoms = 0.275 mol + 0.275 mol = 0.550 mol\n\n9. **Total number of atoms in salts A and B:**\n   - Since the salts are equimolar, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is twice the total number of atoms in one salt.\n   - Total number of atoms in salts A and B = 2 * 0.550 mol = 1.10 mol\n\n10. **Converting to atoms:**\n    - Since the salts are equimolar, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 1.10 mol * 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 atoms/mol = 6.624 \u00d7 10^23 atoms\n\nTherefore, the total number of all atoms in salts A and B is approximately 6.624 \u00d7 10^23 atoms.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\nA. 15"
