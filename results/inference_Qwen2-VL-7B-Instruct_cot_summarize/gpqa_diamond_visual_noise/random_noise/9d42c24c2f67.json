The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n\nA. ~0.07\nB. ~0.32\nC. ~0.39\nD. ~0.11\n"

The transit method relies on the decrease in brightness of a star when an exoplanet passes in front of it.\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation (\\(\\Delta V\\)) due to a transit can be approximated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta V \\approx \\frac{R_p}{R_*}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(R_p\\) is the radius of the exoplanet,\n- \\(R_*\\) is the radius of the star.\n\nGiven that the star's radius is equal to that of the Sun (\\(R_* = R_{\\odot}\\)), and the observed amplitude of the brightness variation due to the dark spots is equivalent to the amplitude produced by a hypothetical exoplanet, we can use the formula to find \\(R_p\\).\n\nThe observed amplitude (\\(\\Delta V_{\\text{obs}}\\)) due to the dark spots is not explicitly given, but we can infer that it is related to the filling factor of the dark spots. The filling factor of 20% indicates that 20% of the star's surface is covered by dark spots. However, for the purpose of this problem, we are more interested in the relative radius of the exoplanet compared to the star.\n\nSince the question asks for the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius (\\(R_p / R_*\\)), we can use the formula directly without needing the exact amplitude value. The key is to understand that the amplitude is directly proportional to the ratio \\(R_p / R_*\\).\n\nGiven the options:\nA. ~0.07\nB. ~0.32\nC. ~0.39\nD. ~0.11\n\nWe need to find the option that represents the same amplitude signal as the observed variations due to the dark spots. Since the question implies that the amplitude is the same, we can use the formula to check which option matches the expected amplitude.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. ~0.32"
