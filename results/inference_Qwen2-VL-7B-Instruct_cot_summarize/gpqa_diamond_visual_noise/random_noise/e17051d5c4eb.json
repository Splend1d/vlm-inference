The para-isomer is formed when the electrophile (bromine) attacks the benzene ring at the para position relative to any substituents present.\n\nHere is the reactivity order based on the substituents:\n\n1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**: Electron-donating (inductive effect)\n2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl ester group)**: Electron-donating (inductive effect)\n3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine atom)**: Electron-withdrawing (inductive effect)\n4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**: Electron-withdrawing (inductive effect)\n5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**: Electron-donating (inductive effect)\n6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)**: Electron-withdrawing (inductive effect)\n\nThe reactivity order from least reactive to most reactive is:\n1. C6H5-CH3 (least reactive)\n2. C6H5-COOC2H5 (less reactive)\n3. C6H5-Cl (less reactive)\n4. C6H5-NO2 (most reactive)\n5. C6H5-C2H5 (less reactive)\n6. C6H5-COOH (most reactive)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is:\n1. C6H5-CH3\n2. C6H5-COOC2H5\n3. C6H5-Cl\n4. C6H5-NO2\n5. C6H5-C2H5\n6.
