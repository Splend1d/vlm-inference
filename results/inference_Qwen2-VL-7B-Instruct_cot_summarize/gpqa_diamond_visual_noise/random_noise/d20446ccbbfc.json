Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a concept in physics where a system's symmetry is broken due to external conditions or interactions, leading to a preferred state or symmetry.\n\n- **Magnon**: Magnons are quanta of spin in a magnetic material. They are associated with the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in magnetic systems.\n- **Phonon**: Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations in a solid. They are associated with the breaking of translational symmetry in solid-state physics.\n- **Pion**: Pions are elementary particles that are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in the strong force.\n- **Skyrmion**: Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain field theories, often associated with the breaking of rotational symmetry.\n\nGiven this context, the particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is:\n\n**B. Phonon**\n\nPhonons are associated with translational symmetry breaking, not with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the context of the other particles listed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
