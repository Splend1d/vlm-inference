The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\n\nWhen compounds are on top of each other, it often indicates that they are interacting with each other through weak forces such as van der Waals forces, which are non-covalent interactions. This can happen when the compounds are in a solid state or when they are close together in a solution, leading to a layered or stacked arrangement."
