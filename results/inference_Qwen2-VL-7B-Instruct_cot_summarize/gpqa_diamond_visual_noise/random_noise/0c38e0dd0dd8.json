Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\n- This statement is correct. SARS-CoV-2 uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting to create two polyproteins near the 5` end of the genome, and the frameshifting mechanism is similar to that of SARS-CoV.\n\nB. SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\n- This statement is correct.

This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n- This statement is correct. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation, which is a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and does not affect Bcl-2 expression.\n\nD.

Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.\n- This statement is incorrect. The rate of frameshifting is not linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. The rate of frameshifting is influenced by various factors, including the structure of the pseudoknot and the tension applied to it.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is:\n\nD. The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt."
