The total energy before the reaction (initial energy) must equal the total energy after the reaction (final energy).\n\nThe initial energy is the sum of the rest masses of the reactants, and the final energy is the sum of the rest masses of the products. The difference between the final energy and the initial energy is the kinetic energy of the product particles.\n\nThe rest masses of the particles involved are:\n- Sn(s): 118.71 MeV\n- Cl2(g): 35.46 MeV\n- SnCl4(l): 234.17 MeV\n\nThe initial energy (E_initial) is the sum of the rest masses of the reactants:\nE_initial = 118.71 MeV + 2 * 35.46 MeV = 118.71 MeV + 70.92 MeV = 189.63 MeV\n\nThe final energy (E_final) is the sum of the rest masses of the products:\nE_final = 234.17 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles is the difference between the final energy and the initial energy:\nKE = E_final - E_initial\nKE = 234.17 MeV - 189.63 MeV = 44.54 MeV\n\nNow, we need to find the kinetic energy of each product particle. Since there are two Cl2(g) molecules and two SnCl4(l) molecules, the kinetic energy of each Cl2(g) molecule is:\nKE_Cl2 = KE / 2 = 44.54 MeV / 2 = 22.27 MeV\n\nAnd the kinetic energy of each SnCl4(l) molecule is:\nKE_SnCl4 = KE / 2 = 44.54 MeV / 2 = 22.27 MeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the product particles is 22.27 MeV for each Cl2(g) molecule and 22.27 MeV for each SnCl4(l) molecule.\n\nThe closest option to this is:\nC. 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nHowever, this option does not match the calculated kinetic energies. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct kinetic energies are approximately 22.27 MeV for each Cl2(g) molecule and 22.27 MeV for each SnCl4(l) molecule."
