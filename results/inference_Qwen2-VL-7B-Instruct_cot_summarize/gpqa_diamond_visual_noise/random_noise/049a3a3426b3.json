This is typically achieved through a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n\n### Reaction 2:\n\\[ \\text{2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile} + \\text{B} (\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) \\rightarrow \\text{2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid} \\]\n\n1. **2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile** is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group.\n2. **B** needs to be a reagent that can react with the nitrile group to form the desired product.\n\nThe product, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, suggests that the reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to form a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Analysis of Reagents:\n- **A** and **B** need to be chosen such that they can react with the respective reactants to form the products.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n- **A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH**:\n  - **NaHSO3** is a weak acid that can act as a dehydrating agent.\n  - **CH3COOH** is a weak acid that can act as a catalyst.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- For Reaction 1, **NaHSO3** can act as a dehydrating agent to form the hydroxyl group.\n- For Reaction 2, **CH3COOH** can act as a catalyst to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.\n\nTherefore, the suitable reagents are:\n\n**A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH**\n\nThe correct answer is:\n**A. A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH**"
