The base (t-BuOK) will abstract a proton from the ketone, forming a carbamion, which then adds to the double bond of ethyl acrylate. The resulting product will be an ester.\n\nThe major product will be the one that is more stable and less sterically hindered. The product will have the carbamion attached to the less substituted carbon of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\n1. **1-nitropropane** is a nitroalkane.\n2. **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** is an unsaturated nitrile.\n3. **KOH** is a base that can abstract a proton from the nitroalkane.\n\nThe reaction is likely to proceed through a nucleophilic addition-elimination mechanism. The base (KOH) will abstract a proton from the nitroalkane, forming a carbamion, which then adds to the double bond of the nitrile. The resulting product will be an amide.\n\nThe major product will be the one that is more stable and less sterically hindered. The product will have the carbamion attached to the less substituted carbon of the alkane.\n\n### Analysis of the Products\n\n- **A. ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**: This product has the carbamion attached to the less substituted carbon of the cyclohexane ring, making it the most stable.\n- **B. ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**: This product has the carbamion attached to the more substituted carbon of the cyclohexane ring, making it less stable.\n- **C. 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**: This product has the carbamion attached to the less substituted carbon of the alkane, making it the most stable.\n- **D. 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile**: This product has the carbamion attached to the more substituted carbon of the alkane, making it less stable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe major products are:\n- **A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**\n- **B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**"
