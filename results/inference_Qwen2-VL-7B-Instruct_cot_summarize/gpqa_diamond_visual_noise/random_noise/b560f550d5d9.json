The 1H NMR data includes:\n\n- A doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n- A doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n- A singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n- A doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n1. The doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) suggests a vinyl proton (C=C) with a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, indicating a trans-disposition of the vinyl group.\n2. The doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests a vinyl proton with a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz (trans-disposition) and a coupling constant of 10.0 Hz (indicating a geminal relationship with another proton).\n3. The singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H, s) suggests an acetate group (CH3COO).\n4. The doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group (CH3) with a coupling constant of 10.0 Hz (indicating a geminal relationship with another proton).\n\nGiven these observations, the structure must have a vinyl group (C=C) with a doublet of quadruplets (indicating a trans-disposition) and an acetate group (CH3COO). The presence of a methyl group (CH3) with a coupling constant of 10.0 Hz suggests it is geminal to another proton, which is consistent with the vinyl group.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is:\n\nA. Trans-propenyl acetate"
