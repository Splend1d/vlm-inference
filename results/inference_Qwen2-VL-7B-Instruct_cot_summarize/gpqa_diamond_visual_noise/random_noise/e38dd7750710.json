These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA.
