The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA. ~ 0.53\nB. ~ 0.98\nC. ~ 1.05\nD. ~ 1.30\n"

The formula for the Stefan-Boltzmann law is:\n\n\\[ P = \\sigma A T^4 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the power emitted by the black body,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\\( 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{W m}^{-2} \\text{K}^{-4} \\)),\n- \\( A \\) is the surface area of the black body,\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature of the black body.\n\nSince both planets are in circular orbits and have the same albedo, the amount of radiation they emit will be proportional to their surface areas. The surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the planet.\n\nFor Planet1:\n- Mass = 7 Earth masses\n- Radius = 1.7 times Earth's radius\n\nFor Planet2:\n- Mass = 5 Earth masses\n- Radius = 1.3 times Earth's radius\n\nSince the planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their emitted radiation will be proportional to the ratio of their surface areas. Therefore, we can calculate the ratio of their surface areas:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_{\\text{Planet1}}}{A_{\\text{Planet2}}} = \\frac{4\\pi (1.7 \\text{ Earth radii})^2}{4\\pi (1.3 \\text{ Earth radii})^2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_{\\text{Planet1}}}{A_{\\text{Planet2}}} = \\left( \\frac{1.7}{1.3} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_{\\text{Planet1}}}{A_{\\text{Planet2}}} = \\left( 1.3077 \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_{\\text{Planet1}}}{A_{\\text{Planet2}}} \\approx 1.71 \\]\n\nSince the emitted radiation is proportional to the surface area, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures will be the inverse of this ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{Planet1}}}{T_{\\text{Planet2}}} = \\frac{1}{1.71} \\approx 0.58 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.58.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nA. ~ 0.53"
