Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\nA. ~ 1.2\nB. ~ 0.4\nC. ~ 0.7\nD. ~ 0.6\n"

The mass function, \\( f \\), is given by:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 R^3}{G T^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( R \\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit,\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n- \\( T \\) is the orbital period.\n\nThe mass function is proportional to the sum of the masses of the stars in the system. Therefore, the ratio of the masses of the two systems can be determined by the ratio of their mass functions.\n\nGiven:\n- For system_1, the orbital period \\( T_1 = 2 \\) years and the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s.\n- For system_2, the orbital period \\( T_2 = 1 \\) year and the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n\nThe mass function for system_1 is:\n\n\\[ f_1 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 R_1^3}{G T_1^2} \\]\n\nThe mass function for system_2 is:\n\n\\[ f_2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 R_2^3}{G T_2^2} \\]\n\nThe ratio of the mass functions is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\frac{\\frac{4 \\pi^2 R_1^3}{G T_1^2}}{\\frac{4 \\pi^2 R_2^3}{G T_2^2}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given periods:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThis means that the mass of system_1 is 4 times the mass of system_2. Therefore, the mass of system_1 is approximately 4 times the mass of system_2.\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2:\n\n\\[ \\text{Factor} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4 \\]\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include 4.
