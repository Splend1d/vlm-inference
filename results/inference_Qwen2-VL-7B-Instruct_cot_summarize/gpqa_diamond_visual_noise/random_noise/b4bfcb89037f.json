Let's analyze each option to determine the correct sequence of reagents:\n\n1. **Reduction of Ethynylcyclohexane to Ethylcyclohexane:**\n   - **Option A:** Uses NaNH2 and methanol, which is not suitable for reduction.\n   - **Option B:** Uses NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which is suitable for reduction.\n   - **Option C:** Uses NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, which is not suitable for reduction.\n   - **Option D:** Uses NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which is suitable for reduction.\n\n2. **Hydroxylation of Ethylcyclohexane:**\n   - **Option A:** Uses Li/liq. NH3, which is suitable for hydroxylation.\n   - **Option B:** Uses Li/liq. NH3, which is suitable for hydroxylation.\n   - **Option C:** Uses Li/liq. NH3, which is suitable for hydroxylation.\n   - **Option D:** Uses Li/liq. NH3, which is suitable for hydroxylation.\n\n3. **Ozonolysis of the Hydroxyethylcyclohexane:**\n   - **Option A:** Uses O3/ (CH3)2S, which is suitable for ozonolysis.\n   - **Option B:** Uses O3/ (CH3)2S, which is suitable for ozonolysis.\n   - **Option C:** Uses O3/ H2O, which is suitable for ozonolysis.\n   - **Option D:** Uses O3/ (CH3)2S, which is suitable for ozonolysis.\n\n4. **Hydrolysis of the Aldehyde:**\n   - **Option A:** Uses NH4OH, which is suitable for hydrolysis.\n   - **Option B:** Uses Ba(OH)2, which is suitable for hydrolysis.\n   - **Option C:** Uses Ba(OH)2, which is suitable for hydrolysis.\n   - **Option D:** Uses Ba(OH)2, which is suitable for hydrolysis.\n\nGiven the correct sequence of steps, the correct answer is:\n\n**Option B:**\n1. NaNH2, methyl chloride\n2. H2/Pd\n3. Ba(OH)2\n4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O\n\nThis sequence involves:\n1. Reduction of ethynylcyclohexane to ethylcyclohexane using NaNH2 and methyl chloride.\n2. Hydroxylation of ethylcyclohexane using Li/liq. NH3.\n3. Ozonolysis of the hydroxyethylcyclohexane using O3/ (CH3)2S.\n4. Hydrolysis of the aldehyde using Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, and HgSO4.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane is **Option B**."
