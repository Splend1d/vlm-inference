The relationship between parallax (\\( \\pi \\)) and distance (\\( d \\)) is:\n\\[ \\text{parallax} = \\frac{1}{d} \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the relationship for the number of stars, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Number of stars} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\right)^5} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of stars} \\propto d^5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance as \\( d^5 \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. ~ r^5"
