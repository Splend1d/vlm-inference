According to the information provided, a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is required for detection.\n\nThe detectability of a star depends on its absolute V magnitude and its distance from the observer. The absolute V magnitude is a measure of the star's brightness, and the distance affects the apparent brightness due to the inverse square law.\n\nThe absolute V magnitude of the stars in question is 15 mag. The detectability equation for a star is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{S/N} = \\frac{V_{\\text{abs}}}{\\sqrt{t \\cdot d^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( V_{\\text{abs}} \\) is the absolute V magnitude (15 mag in this case)\n- \\( t \\) is the exposure time (1 hour = 3600 seconds)\n- \\( d \\) is the distance in parsecs\n\nWe need to calculate the S/N for each star and compare it to the required S/N of 10.\n\n### Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us:\n\\[ d = 10 \\, \\text{pc} \\]\n\\[ \\text{S/N} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{3600 \\cdot 10^2}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{360000}} = \\frac{15}{600} = 0.025 \\]\n\nThis S/N is much less than 10, so this star is not detectable.\n\n### Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us:\n\\[ d = 200 \\, \\text{pc} \\]\n\\[ \\text{S/N} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{3600 \\cdot 200^2}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{144000000}} = \\frac{15}{37682.1} \\approx 0.0004 \\]\n\nThis S/N is much less than 10, so this star is not detectable.\n\n### Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us:\n\\[ d = 5 \\, \\text{pc} \\]\n\\[ \\text{S/N} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{3600 \\cdot 5^2}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{90000}} = \\frac{15}{300} = 0.05 \\]\n\nThis S/N is greater than 10, so this star is detectable.\n\n### Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us:\n\\[ d = 50 \\, \\text{pc} \\]\n\\[ \\text{S/N} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{3600 \\cdot 50^2}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{9000000}} = \\frac{15}{3000} = 0.005 \\]\n\nThis S/N is much less than 10, so this star is not detectable.\n\n### Summary:\n- Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us: Not detectable\n- Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us: Not detectable\n- Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us: Detectable\n- Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us: Not detectable\n\nTherefore, the number of detectable stars is 1.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 2"
