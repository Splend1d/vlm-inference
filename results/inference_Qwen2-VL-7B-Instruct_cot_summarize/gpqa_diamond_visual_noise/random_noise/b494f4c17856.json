This suggests that A has a bromine atom attached to one of its carbon atoms.\n\n3. **Compound C** is formed by reacting B with alcoholic KOH. C has two geometrical isomers.\n\n4. **The cis-isomer of C** reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D.\n\nLet's consider the possible structures for A, B, and C:\n\n- **Compound A**:\n  - The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbon atom.\n  - The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests a methylene group (CH2) attached to a carbon atom.\n\n- **Compound B**:\n  - Compound B is formed by monobromination of A. This suggests that A has a bromine atom attached to one of its carbon atoms.\n\n- **Compound C**:\n  - Compound C has two geometrical isomers, suggesting it has a double bond.\n\n- **The cis-isomer of C**:\n  - It reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D.\n\nGiven the information, let's consider the possible structures for D:\n\n- **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**:\n  - This structure has a double bond and three methyl groups.\n  - It does not fit the description of the cis-isomer reacting with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n- **(1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**:\n  - This structure has a double bond and two methyl groups.\n  - It does not fit the description of the cis-isomer reacting with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n- **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**:\n  - This structure has a double bond and three methyl groups.\n  - It does not fit the description of the cis-isomer reacting with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n- **(1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**:\n  - This structure has a double bond and two methyl groups.\n  - It fits the description of the cis-isomer reacting with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
