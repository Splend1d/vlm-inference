The general reaction can be represented as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{R}-\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}-\\text{R} + \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{R}-\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}-\\text{R} \\]\n\nFor the given compounds:\n\n1. **3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+**\n   - The diol is 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. The rearrangement will involve the migration of the methyl group from the 3-position to the 2-position.\n   - The product will be 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one.\n\n2. **3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+**\n   - The diol is 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol. The rearrangement will involve the migration of the hydroxy group from the 3-position to the 2-position.\n   - The product will be 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one.\n\n3. **1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+**\n   - The diol is 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol. The rearrangement will involve the migration of the methoxy group from the 2-position to the 1-position.\n   - The product will be 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C.
