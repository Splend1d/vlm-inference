                    "text": "To determine which statement is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system, let's analyze each statement in the context of ethylene polymerization and catalyst systems:\n\n1. **Statement A: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n   - This statement suggests that the use of dual catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization with regular branches is already in use on an industrial scale in the US. While it is true that dual catalyst systems are used in industrial polymerization processes, the specific mention of ethylene polymerization with regular branches and the combination of a group VIa transition metal catalyst with specific activators is more specific and less common.\n\n2. **Statement B: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n   - This statement is partially correct. Noble metals like platinum or palladium can indeed be used as catalysts in ethylene polymerization, but they are typically more expensive compared to other catalysts. However, the statement does not specify that noble metals are the only noble metals that can be used, nor does it mention the specific combination of catalysts for regular branching.\n\n3. **Statement C: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Aluminum-based activators are commonly used in ethylene polymerization, particularly in the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system, which is known for producing high-density polyethylene. Therefore, aluminum-based activators are indeed used for the essential additional reaction step.\n\n4. **Statement D: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n   - This statement is correct. Group VIa transition metals, such as molybdenum or tungsten, can be used in combination with specific activators to form ethylene polymerization catalysts. These catalysts are capable of producing ethylene polymers with regular branches, which is the desired outcome for the scientist's research.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**D. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**"
