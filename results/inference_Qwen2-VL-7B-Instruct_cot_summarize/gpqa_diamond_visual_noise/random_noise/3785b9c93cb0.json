However, we need to consider the effect of the cavity as well. The cavity will create a potential difference between the conductor and the cavity, but since the cavity is small and the distance \\( L \\) is large, the effect of the cavity on the electric field at point P will be negligible compared to the conductor.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   The electric field \\( E \\) at point P due to the spherical conductor is:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{L^2}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. \\( E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{L^2} \\)"
