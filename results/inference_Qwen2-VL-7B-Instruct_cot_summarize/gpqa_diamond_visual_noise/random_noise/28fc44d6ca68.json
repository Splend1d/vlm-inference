According to the problem, \\( m_1 = 2m_2 \\) and \\( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \\).\n\nFrom these equations, we can solve for \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\):\n\n1. \\( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \\)\n2. \\( m_1 = 2m_2 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( m_1 = 2m_2 \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\( 2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\)\n\\( 3m_2 = 0.99M \\)\n\\( m_2 = \\frac{0.99M}{3} \\)\n\\( m_2 = 0.33M \\)\n\\( m_1 = 2m_2 = 2 \\times 0.33M = 0.66M \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the kinetic energy using the relativistic formula\n\nThe kinetic energy \\( T \\) of a particle with mass \\( m \\) moving at velocity \\( v \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\gamma m c^2 - m c^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\) is the Lorentz factor, \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle.\n\nFor the more massive fragment (\\( m_1 = 0.66M \\)):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nSince the fragment is at rest initially, \\( v = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{0^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1}} = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the kinetic energy \\( T_1 \\) is:\n\n\\[ T_1 = \\gamma m_1 c^2 - m_1 c^2 \\]\n\\[ T_1 = 1 \\times 0.66M c^2 - 0.66M c^2 \\]\n\\[ T_1 = 0.66M c^2 - 0.66M c^2 \\]\n\\[ T_1 = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nIn the classical approximation, the kinetic energy \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nSince the fragment is at rest initially, \\( v = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ T_1 = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.66M \\times 0^2 = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies\n\nThe difference between the relativistic kinetic energy \\( T_1 \\) and the classical kinetic energy \\( T_1 \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta T = T_1 - T_1 = 0 - 0 = 0 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe difference between the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical kinetic energy is 0 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 10 MeV."
