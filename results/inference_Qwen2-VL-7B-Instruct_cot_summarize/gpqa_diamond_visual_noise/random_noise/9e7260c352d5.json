Therefore, the number of chemically distinct hydrogens is likely less than 18.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. 5\n- B. 10\n- C. 12\n- D. 8\n\nThe closest number of distinct hydrogen signals that fits the description is **C. 12**.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4 is **12**."
