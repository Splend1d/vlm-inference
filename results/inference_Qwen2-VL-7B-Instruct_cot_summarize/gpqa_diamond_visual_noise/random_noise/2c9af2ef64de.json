                    "text": "To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity. The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state, and the final state has T(NN) = 0. The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1.\n\nThe term symbol for the final NN state is given as \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\) (mod 2). Since \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 = 0 \\]\n\\[ S(NN) + L(NN) = -1 \\]\n\nThe intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is -1, which implies that the total angular momentum \\( J \\) of the final NN state must be odd (since the intrinsic parity is -1 and the total parity is 0, the total angular momentum must be odd to satisfy the parity conservation rule).\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 3D3 + f \\)\n- \\( 3D3 \\) corresponds to \\( L = 3 \\) and \\( S = 0 \\).\n- \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 3D3 \\) implies \\( S + L = 3 \\), which is odd.\n- The parity of \\( 3D3 \\) is -1 (since \\( L \\) is odd and \\( S \\) is even).\n- The parity of \\( f \\) is +1 (since it is a particle with intrinsic parity +1).\n- The total parity of the final state would be \\( -1 + 1 = 0 \\), which is allowed.\n\nB. \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 7D1 + p \\)\n- \\( 7D1 \\) corresponds to \\( L = 1 \\) and \\( S = 0 \\).\n- \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 7D1 \\) implies \\( S + L = 1 \\), which is odd.\n- The parity of \\( 7D1 \\) is -1 (since \\( L \\) is odd and \\( S \\) is even).\n- The parity of \\( p \\) is +1 (since it is a particle with intrinsic parity +1).\n- The total parity of the final state would be \\( -1 + 1 = 0 \\), which is allowed.\n\nC. \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 3P0 + s \\)\n- \\( 3P0 \\) corresponds to \\( L = 0 \\) and \\( S = 1 \\).\n- \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 3P0 \\) implies \\( S + L = 1 \\), which is odd.\n- The parity of \\( 3P0 \\) is -1 (since \\( L \\) is even and \\( S \\) is odd).\n- The parity of \\( s \\) is +1 (since it is a particle with intrinsic parity +1).\n- The total parity of the final state would be \\( -1 + 1 = 0 \\), which is allowed.\n\nD. \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 3S1 + p \\)\n- \\( 3S1 \\) corresponds to \\( L = 1 \\) and \\( S = 0 \\).\n- \\( 1S0 \\rightarrow 3S1 \\) implies \\( S + L = 1 \\), which is odd.\n- The parity of \\( 3S1 \\) is -1 (since \\( L \\) is odd and \\( S \\) is even).\n- The parity of \\( p \\) is +1 (since it is a particle with intrinsic parity +1).\n- The total parity of the final state would be \\( -1 + 1 = 0 \\), which is allowed.\n\nUpon reevaluation, all options seem to satisfy the conservation of angular momentum and parity. However, the question seems to be asking for a specific partial wave that is not permitted, which might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the question. Given the analysis, all options are permitted based on the conservation rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNo specific partial wave is not permitted based on the given conservation rules."
