                    "text": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\n\nA. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB. G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC.

G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **G2 is a transcription factor**: Since g2 shows 0% resistance, it is likely that G2 is a transcription factor that is essential for the resistance mechanism. The absence of G2 leads to complete loss of resistance.\n\n2. **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**: Both g1 and g3 show 50% resistance, which is half of the control's resistance. This suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant genes, meaning that the loss of either one does not completely eliminate the resistance mechanism, but it reduces it by half.\n\n3. **G1 is epistatic towards G3**: The double mutant g1g3 shows 10% resistance, which is less than the resistance of g1 (75%) but more than the resistance of g3 (50%). This indicates that G1 has a dominant effect over G3, meaning that the presence of G1 can overcome the absence of G3 to some extent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
