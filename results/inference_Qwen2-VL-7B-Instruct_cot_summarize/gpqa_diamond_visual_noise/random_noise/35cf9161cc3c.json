For the first planet, \\( b = 0.2 \\).\n\n2. **Occultation Condition**:\n   - For a planet to occult a star, its orbital radius must be such that the planet's orbit is inside the star's radius.\n   - The second planet has a radius 2.5 times that of Earth, and we need to find the maximum orbital radius that allows both transit and occultation.\n\nGiven:\n- Radius of the first planet = 1 Earth radius\n- Radius of the second planet = 2.5 Earth radii\n- Radius of the star = 1.5 times the Sun's radius (which is approximately 1.5 times the Earth's radius)\n\nFor the second planet to transit the star:\n\\[ \\frac{r_{\\text{planet}}}{r_{\\text{star}}} = \\frac{2.5 \\text{ Earth radii}}{1.5 \\text{ Earth radii}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nFor the second planet to occult the star:\n\\[ r_{\\text{planet}} < r_{\\text{star}} \\]\n\nCombining these conditions:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{3} < 1.5 \\]\n\nThis condition is satisfied, so the second planet can transit the star.\n\nNow, we need to find the orbital period \\( T \\) of the second planet. The orbital period \\( T \\) is related to the orbital radius \\( r \\) and the star's radius \\( R_{\\text{star}} \\) by Kepler's third law:\n\\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( r_{\\text{planet}} = 2.5 \\text{ Earth radii} \\)\n- \\( R_{\\text{star}} = 1.5 \\text{ Earth radii} \\)\n\nThe orbital period \\( T \\) of the second planet can be calculated as:\n\\[ T = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{\\text{planet}}^3}{R_{\\text{star}}^3}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ T = \\sqrt{\\frac{(2.5)^3}{(1.5)^3}} \\]\n\\[ T = \\sqrt{\\frac{15.625}{3.375}} \\]\n\\[ T = \\sqrt{4.6296} \\]\n\\[ T \\approx 2.15 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events is approximately 2.15 days.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\nA. ~ 12.5"
