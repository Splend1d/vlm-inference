You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.\n\nTo design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus, the first step would be to identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing. This would allow you to obtain the genetic information of the virus, which can then be used to design specific primers for a real-time PCR kit. Real-time PCR is a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting the presence of a specific DNA or RNA sequence, making it an ideal choice for a molecular diagnostic kit."
