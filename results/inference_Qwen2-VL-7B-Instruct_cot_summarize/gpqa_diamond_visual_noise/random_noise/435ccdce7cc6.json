The peaks in the ChIP-seq data represent regions where the protein of interest is bound. In this case, the peaks are disappearing when PFA+DSG fixation is used, which suggests that the protein of interest is not being bound to the genome in the same way as when PFA fixation is used. This is most likely to occur at active promoters and enhancers, which are regions of the genome that are actively transcribed into RNA. Therefore, the answer is B."
