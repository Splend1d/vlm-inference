However, the question is about the distribution of stars in the sky, which is not directly related to the cash flow data.\n\nGiven that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) should be constant. This means that the number of stars per unit plx should not change with plx.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. ~ 1/plx^1"
