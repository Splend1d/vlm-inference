They are:\n\n1. Gauss's law for electric fields: \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\)\n2. Gauss's law for magnetic fields: \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0\\)\n3. Faraday's law of induction: \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\\)\n4. Amp\u00e8re's law with Maxwell's addition: \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 (\\mathbf{J} + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t})\\)\n\nIn a universe where magnets can have isolated poles, the magnetic field would behave differently. Specifically, the divergence of the magnetic field would be affected because an isolated magnetic pole would create a non-zero divergence at its location.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
