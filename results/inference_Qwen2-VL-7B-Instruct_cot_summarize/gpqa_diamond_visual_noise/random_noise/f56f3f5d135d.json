This scenario involves the precession of the magnetic moment around the Y-axis, which is described by the Larmor frequency \\( \\omega_L \\).\n\n7. **Larmor Frequency:**\n   - The Larmor frequency is given by \\( \\omega_L = \\gamma B \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is the gyromagnetic ratio and \\( B \\) is the magnetic field strength.\n\n8. **Oscillation Frequency:**\n   - The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency itself, which is \\( \\gamma B \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( \\gamma B \\)"
