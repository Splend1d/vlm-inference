This increase in temperature can slow down the rate of the chemical reaction, as many reactions are temperature-sensitive and proceed more slowly at higher temperatures. The change in pH from 1 to 4 is also a result of the exothermic reaction, but it is not the primary reason for the change in reaction rate."
