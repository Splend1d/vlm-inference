Grubbs catalyst promotes the formation of new double bonds in alkenes.\n\nRacemic 3-methylpent-1-ene has the following structure:\n\n```\nCH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\n```\n\nThere are two possible double bond positions in this molecule:\n\n1. Between the first and second carbon atoms (C1-C2)\n2. Between the second and third carbon atoms (C2-C3)\n\nFor each of these double bond positions, there are two possible configurations due to the racemic nature of the molecule:\n\n1. One configuration where the double bond is on the left side of the molecule.\n2. One configuration where the double bond is on the right side of the molecule.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 configurations for each of the 2 double bond positions, resulting in:\n\n2 configurations \u00d7 2 double bond positions = 4 possible products.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4"
