The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA. C6H10O2\nB. C6H12O2\nC. C6H12O\nD. C6H10O\n"
