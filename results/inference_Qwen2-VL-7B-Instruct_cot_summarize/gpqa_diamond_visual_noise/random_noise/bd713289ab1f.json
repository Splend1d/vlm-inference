D\u221eh** (Infinite symmetry, typically not applicable to molecules)\n- **B. C2** (Linear symmetry, 2-fold axis)\n- **C. C2v** (Planar symmetry, 2-fold axis and 2 perpendicular mirror planes)\n- **D. D4h** (Tetrahedral symmetry, 4-fold axis and 4 perpendicular mirror planes)\n\nGiven the high symmetry of C and the hazardous nature of E, it is likely that E has a lower symmetry compared to C. Therefore, the most plausible symmetry group for E is one that is less symmetric than C.\n\n**Final Answer: C. C2v**"
