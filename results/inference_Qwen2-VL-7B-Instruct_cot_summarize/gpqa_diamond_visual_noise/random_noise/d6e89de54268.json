The structure of the starting material and product is the same, indicating that the rearrangement does not change the overall structure of the molecule.\n\n2. **Reaction 2:**\n   - Starting material (A): methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate\n   - Product (B): methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate\n\n   The starting material is a dihydroxy compound, and the product is a ketone. The rearrangement involves the conversion of the dihydroxy compound into a ketone, which is a common outcome of the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct answer is:\n\n**C.
