The double bond is more reactive than the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a dibromo compound rather than a bromoketone. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the orientation of the double bond and the approach of the bromine molecule. Given the options, the correct answer is:\n\nA. (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol\n\nThis is because the double bond in 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol is between the 1 and 2 carbon atoms, and the bromine would add in a way that maintains the stereochemistry of the double bond, resulting in the (1R,2R) configuration. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
