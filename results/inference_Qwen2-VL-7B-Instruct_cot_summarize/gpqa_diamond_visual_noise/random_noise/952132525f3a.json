The NMR data includes the following peaks:\n\n- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): This peak suggests the presence of a proton attached to a nitrogen atom, indicating the presence of an amine group (NH).\n- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): This peak corresponds to a doublet of doublets, indicating two aromatic protons.\n- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): This peak also corresponds to a doublet of doublets, indicating another set of two aromatic protons.\n- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): This peak corresponds to a broad singlet, indicating two protons attached to a carbon atom.\n- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): This peak corresponds to a doublet, indicating two protons attached to a carbon atom.\n\nGiven the molecular formula C8H9NO and the NMR data, we can deduce the structure of the compound. The presence of two aromatic protons (6.98 ppm and 6.51 ppm) suggests the presence of two phenyl groups. The broad singlet at 6.27 ppm indicates the presence of two protons attached to a carbon atom, which could be part of an aldehyde group. The doublet at 3.66 ppm suggests the presence of two protons attached to a carbon atom, which could be part of an ethyl group.\n\nConsidering the reaction sequence:\n\n1. NaNO2 + HCl: This step likely converts the amine group into a nitro group.\n2. H2O: This step likely converts the nitro group into an amino group.\n3. aq. KOH, Heat: This step likely converts the amino group into an aldehyde group.\n\nGiven the NMR data and the reaction sequence, the final product is likely to be a compound with an aldehyde group and two phenyl groups. The structure that fits this description is:\n\nC. 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nThis structure has two aromatic protons (6.98 ppm and 6.51 ppm), a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm indicating two protons attached to a carbon atom (likely part of an aldehyde group), and a doublet at 3.66 ppm indicating two protons attached to a carbon atom (likely part of an ethyl group).\n\nTherefore, the final product is:\n\nC. 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal"
