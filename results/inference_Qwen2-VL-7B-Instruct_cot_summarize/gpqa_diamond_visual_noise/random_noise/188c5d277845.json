When heated, the double bond can migrate to different positions along the carbon chain.\n\nLet's analyze the possible isomers:\n\n1. **5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene**: This would have a double bond between the 2 and 6 carbon atoms, which matches the original structure.\n\n2. **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**: This would have a double bond between the 1 and 5 carbon atoms.\n\n3. **5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene**: This would have a double bond between the 2 and 6 carbon atoms, which matches the original structure.\n\n4. **5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene**: This would have a double bond between the 2 and 6 carbon atoms, which matches the original structure.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene**"
