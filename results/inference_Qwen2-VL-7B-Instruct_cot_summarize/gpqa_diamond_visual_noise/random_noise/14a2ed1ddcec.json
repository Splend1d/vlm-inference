Since it is a gas, it is likely a diatomic molecule (e.g., H2, O2, N2, etc.).\n   - The precipitate G forms when heated, and it releases B. B has a melting point very close to 277 K, which is close to the melting point of ice (273 K). Therefore, B is likely water (H2O).\n   - The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. This suggests that the keto acid is a diatomic molecule containing oxygen (e.g., CO2).\n\n2. **Determine the elements and their isotopes:**\n   - From the information given, we can infer the following:\n     - W is likely H2 or O2.\n     - G is likely H2O.\n     - B is likely H2O.\n     - The keto acid is likely CO2.\n\n3. **Calculate the cumulative atomic masses:**\n   - The lightest element in Substance X is hydrogen (H), with an atomic mass of 1 u.\n   - The heaviest element in Substance X is oxygen (O), with an atomic mass of 16 u.\n\n4. **Sum the atomic masses:**\n   - Cumulative atomic mass of the lightest element (H) = 1 u\n   - Cumulative atomic mass of the heaviest element (O) = 16 u\n\n5. **Calculate the total:**\n   - Total cumulative atomic mass = 1 u + 16 u = 17 u\n\nHowever, none of the given options (A. 31, B. 35, C. 29, D. 25) match the calculated total of 17 u. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the given information and calculations, the correct answer should be 17 u, which is not listed among the options."
