The wavelength shift is related to the orbital velocity of the planets, which in turn is related to their orbital periods.\n\nThe formula relating the wavelength shift (\\(\\Delta \\lambda\\)) to the orbital velocity (\\(v\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{v \\cdot \\lambda}{c}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta \\lambda\\) is the wavelength shift,\n- \\(v\\) is the orbital velocity,\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the spectral line,\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5\\) miliangstroms for planet #1,\n- \\(\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7\\) miliangstroms for planet #2.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the orbital periods (\\(T_2/T_1\\)) of the two planets. The orbital velocity (\\(v\\)) is related to the orbital period (\\(T\\)) by:\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{2\\pi R}{T}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(R\\) is the orbital radius.\n\nThe wavelength shift is also related to the orbital velocity by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{v \\cdot \\lambda}{c}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v\\) from the orbital velocity equation into the wavelength shift equation gives:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi R \\cdot \\lambda}{cT}\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(T\\):\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{2\\pi R \\cdot \\lambda}{c \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda}\n\\]\n\nSince the wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) and the speed of light (\\(c\\)) are the same for both planets, we can simplify the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5}{7}\n\\]\n\nTo find the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714\n\\]\n\nThis value is not directly listed in the options. However, we can approximate the closest value:\n\n\\[\n0.714 \\approx 0.71 \\approx 0.7\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to 0.7 is:\n\nB. ~ 0.85"
