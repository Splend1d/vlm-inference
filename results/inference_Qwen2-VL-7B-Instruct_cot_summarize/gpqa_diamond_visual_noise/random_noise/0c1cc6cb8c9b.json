This implies that the interaction is localized and does not involve collective effects.\n\nGiven these points, the assumptions that jointly imply the \"impulse\" approximation are:\n\n- The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\n- The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\n- The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 1,2,3**"
