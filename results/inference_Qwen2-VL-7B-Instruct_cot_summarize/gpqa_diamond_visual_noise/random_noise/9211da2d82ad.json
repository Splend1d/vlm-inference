The IR peak at around 1715 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group in **Compound E**.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n- **A. 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one**: This compound has a carbonyl group at the 1-position, which would give an IR peak around 1715 cm^-1.\n- **B. 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one**: This compound has a carbonyl group at the 1-position, which would give an IR peak around 1715 cm^-1.\n- **C. 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**: This compound has a carbonyl group at the 1-position, which would give an IR peak around 1715 cm^-1.\n- **D. 4-methylcycloheptan-1-one**: This compound has a carbonyl group at the 1-position, which would give an IR peak around 1715 cm^-1.\n\nGiven the IR peak information, all options A, B, C, and D have a carbonyl group at the 1-position, which would give an IR peak around 1715 cm^-1. However, the specific structure and the reaction pathway suggest that **Compound E** is likely to be a compound with a carbonyl group at the 1-position.\n\nTherefore, the most likely compound E is:\n\n**C. 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**"
