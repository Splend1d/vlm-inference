                    "text": "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we need to consider the relationship between the orbital periods and the equilibrium temperatures of the planets. The equilibrium temperature of a planet in orbit around a star is primarily determined by the distance from the star, as the energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance.\n\nGiven the orbital periods of the planets in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can denote the orbital periods as \\( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, \\) and \\( T_5 \\) for Planet_1 through Planet_5, respectively. The ratio of their orbital periods is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{T_2}{T_3} = \\frac{T_3}{T_4} = \\frac{T_4}{T_5} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThis implies that the distance from the star (and thus the equilibrium temperature) is inversely proportional to the square of the orbital period. Therefore, the equilibrium temperatures \\( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, \\) and \\( T_5 \\) are related by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{T_2}{T_3} = \\frac{T_3}{T_4} = \\frac{T_4}{T_5} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThis means that the equilibrium temperature of each planet is one-fourth of the previous planet's temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nHowever, this is not the correct approach to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 directly. Instead, we should consider the direct relationship between the orbital periods and the equilibrium temperatures.\n\nGiven the orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures by considering the inverse square relationship:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{T_2}{T_3} = \\frac{T_3}{T_4} = \\frac{T_4}{T_5} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nHowever, this is not the correct approach to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 directly.
