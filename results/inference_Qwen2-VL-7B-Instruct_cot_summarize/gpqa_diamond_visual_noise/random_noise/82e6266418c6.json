It includes both spatial rotations and boosts (relativistic transformations).\n\n2. **Poincare Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with the invariance under translations in spacetime. It is also a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model and is preserved in the SMEFT.\n\n3. **CP Symmetry**: This symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetries. While CP symmetry is generally broken in the Standard Model, it can be restored in certain models or approximations. However, it is not a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model and is not necessarily preserved in the SMEFT.\n\n4. **CPT Symmetry**: This symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). It is a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model and is preserved in the SMEFT.\n\nGiven the options:\n\n- **A. 3,4**: This includes CP and CPT symmetries, which are not necessarily preserved in the SMEFT.\n- **B. 1,2,4**: This includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries, which are fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model and are preserved in the SMEFT.\n- **C. 1,3,4**: This includes Lorentz, CP, and CPT symmetries. While Lorentz and CPT are fundamental symmetries, CP is not necessarily preserved in the SMEFT.\n- **D. 1,2**: This includes Lorentz and Poincare symmetries, which are fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model and are preserved in the SMEFT.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 1,2,4**"
