The potential energy between the charge and the sphere is:\n\\[ U = \\frac{k q^2}{d} \\]\n\nHowever, since the sphere is grounded, the charge \\( q \\) will be neutralized by the induced charges on the surface of the sphere. The net potential energy of the system will be zero because the induced charges on the sphere will exactly cancel out the charge \\( q \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{C.
