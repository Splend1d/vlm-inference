He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n\n\nA.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles.\n\nThe efficiency of qPCR is given as 100%, which means that the reaction is doubling the amount of target nucleic acid at each cycle. The slope of the calibration curve is -3.3, which indicates that the reaction is doubling every 2^(-3.3) cycles, or approximately every 1.6 cycles. \n\nGiven the dilutions provided (100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10 copies per \u00b5l), the expected cycle threshold (Ct) values for each dilution should be approximately 33.3, 35.3, 36.6, 37.9, and 39.2 cycles, respectively, based on the efficiency of 100% and the slope of -3.3.\n\nThe observed Ct values are:\n- 100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5\n- 10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2\n- 1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9\n- 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6\n- 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3\n\nThe discrepancies are that the observed Ct values are significantly lower than expected for the higher dilutions (100000 and 10000 copies) and higher than expected for the lower dilutions (100 and 10 copies). This suggests that the dilution factor is more than 3.3 cycles, which is not possible with a 100% efficient qPCR reaction. Therefore, the correct explanation is that the ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles."
