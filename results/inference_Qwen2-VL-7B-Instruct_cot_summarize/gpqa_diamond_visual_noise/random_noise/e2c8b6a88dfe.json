The key point here is that both the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. This means that the motion of the Galaxy relative to the ejecta is the same as the motion of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy.\n\nGiven:\n- The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\).\n- The time that passes in the ejecta reference frame is \\( t = 50 \\, \\text{seconds} \\).\n\nWe need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy reference frame. Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are moving towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{relative}} = v_{\\text{ejecta}} + v_{\\text{Galaxy}} = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} + 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} = 120,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the formula for distance traveled in a given time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 120,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 50 \\, \\text{s} = 6,000,000 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6,000,000 \\, \\text{km}} \\]\n\nHowever, this option is not listed among the choices provided. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the options. Given the calculations, the correct answer should be:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6,000,000 \\, \\text{km}} \\]"
