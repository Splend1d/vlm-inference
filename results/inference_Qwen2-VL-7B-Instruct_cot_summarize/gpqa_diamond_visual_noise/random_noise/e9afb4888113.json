Superstring Theory, while not directly related to high energy physics, often involves regularization to handle divergences in its calculations. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) also requires regularization at high energies to deal with infinities in the electromagnetic interactions. Classical Electrodynamics, on the other hand, does not involve regularization at high energies because it does not deal with the quantum nature of particles and fields. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Classical Electrodynamics"
