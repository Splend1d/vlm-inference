                    "text": "To determine which compound does not show tautomerism and which shows optical isomerism, let's analyze each option:\n\n### Tautomerism\nTautomerism refers to the interconversion of molecules with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. This typically involves the movement of a hydrogen atom between two functional groups.\n\n1. **Benzoquinone (C6H4O2):**\n   - Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it is a stable compound with a specific structure and does not undergo interconversion between different forms.\n\n2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C6H4(CO)3):**\n   - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can show tautomerism because it has multiple functional groups (ketones) that can interconvert.\n\n### Optical Isomerism\nOptical isomerism (or chirality) occurs when molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangement. This results in molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (CH3CH(OH)CH2CO2H):**\n   - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule because it has a carbon atom with four different groups attached to it (CH3, OH, CH2CO2H). This results in two optical isomers.\n\n2. **Dimethyl fumarate (CH3CH=CHCO2CH3):**\n   - Dimethyl fumarate is not chiral because it has a carbon double bond that is part of a conjugated system, which means it does not have a chiral center. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **A = benzoquinone** does not show tautomerism.\n- **B = dimethyl fumarate** does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate**"
