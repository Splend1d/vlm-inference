The peak at m/z = 158 (32%) indicates a chlorine substitution, suggesting the formula could be C8H6ClO2.\n\n2. **Infrared Spectroscopy (IR):**\n   - A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 (OH stretching)\n   - A strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 (C=O stretching)\n\n   The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 indicates the presence of an OH group, and the strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n3. **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR):**\n   - 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) - This is a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is characteristic of an OH group.\n   - 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) - This is a doublet at 8.02 ppm, which is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n   - 7.72 ppm (d, 2H) - This is another doublet at 7.72 ppm, also characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\nGiven these spectral data, the compound must have an OH group, a benzene ring, and a carbonyl group. Let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **4-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n   - Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2\n   - No OH group.\n\nB. **2-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n   - Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2\n   - No OH group.\n\nC. **3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**:\n   - Molecular formula: C8H6ClO2\n   - Contains an OH group (11.0 ppm singlet), a benzene ring (8.02 ppm doublet), and a carbonyl group (1720 cm^-1).\n\nD. **Phenyl chloroformate**:\n   - Molecular formula: C8H7ClO2\n   - No OH group.\n\nBased on the spectral data, the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug is:\n\n**C. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**"
