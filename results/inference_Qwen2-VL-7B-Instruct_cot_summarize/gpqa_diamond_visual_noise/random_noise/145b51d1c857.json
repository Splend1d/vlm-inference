                    "text": "A eukaryotic cell evolved a mechanism to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy. The process occurs in mitochondria, which are cellular energy factories. In the series of redox reactions, the energy from food is stored between the phosphate groups and used as a universal cellular currency. The energy-laden molecules are shuttled out of the mitochondrion to serve in all cellular processes. You discovered a new anti-diabetes drug and want to investigate whether it has an effect on the mitochondria. You set up a range of experiments with your HEK293 cell line. Which of the experiments listed below will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug:\n\nA. Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 \u03bcM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide\nB. Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells\nC. Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant\nD. Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit\n"

                    "text": "To determine which experiment will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 \u03bcM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (TTC)**:\n   - This dye is used to stain mitochondria. By labeling the cells with TTC and performing flow cytometry, you can quantify the number of mitochondria in the cells. This will help you understand the distribution and abundance of mitochondria in the cells, which is crucial for understanding their role in cellular processes.\n\nB. **Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells**:\n   - Mito-RTP is a dye that specifically stains mitochondria. By using confocal fluorescence microscopy, you can visualize the mitochondria in the cells. This will help you observe the morphology and distribution of mitochondria, which is essential for understanding their role in cellular processes.\n\nC. **Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant**:\n   - This experiment involves using recombinant luciferase to measure ATP levels in the supernatant. ATP is a key molecule in cellular energy metabolism, and its levels can be indicative of mitochondrial function. By measuring ATP levels, you can indirectly assess the mitochondrial activity and function.\n\nD. **Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit**:\n   - This experiment involves isolating mitochondria from the cells using differential centrifugation and then measuring glucose uptake using a colorimetric assay. Glucose uptake is a key process in mitochondrial function, and measuring it can provide direct evidence of mitochondrial activity and function.\n\nGiven the options, the experiment that will not help you discover the mitochondrial role of your drug is:\n\n**C. Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 \u03bcM of luciferin addition to the supernatant**\n\nThis experiment measures ATP levels in the supernatant, which is not directly related to the mitochondrial function. It provides information about the overall energy metabolism of the cells but does not specifically target the mitochondrial role of the drug.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
