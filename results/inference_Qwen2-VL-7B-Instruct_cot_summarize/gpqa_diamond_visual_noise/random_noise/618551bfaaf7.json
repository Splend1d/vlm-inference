The pH of a basic solution can be calculated using the following equation:\n\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nwhere pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.\n\nTo calculate pOH, we need to determine the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution:\n\n[OH-] = (Net moles of base) / (Total volume)\n[OH-] = 0.09 mol / 1.2 L = 0.075 M\n\nNow, we can calculate pOH:\n\npOH = -log[OH-]\npOH = -log(0.075) = 1.12\n\nFinally, we can calculate the pH:\n\npH = 14 - pOH\npH = 14 - 1.12 = 12.88\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.88.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 12.62."
