Optical activity is exhibited by chiral compounds, which are those that do not have a plane of symmetry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has a Z configuration, which means it is not chiral and will not exhibit optical activity.\n\n2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This compound has a specific stereochemistry (3aR,7aS,E), indicating it is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has a specific stereochemistry (2R,3S), indicating it is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has a specific stereochemistry (2R,3R), indicating it is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This compound has a specific stereochemistry (R), indicating it is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has a specific stereochemistry (1s,3s,5s), indicating it is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This compound does not have a specific stereochemistry that indicates chirality, so it will not exhibit optical activity.\n\nAfter analyzing each compound, we find that 5 of the given compounds exhibit optical activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 5"
