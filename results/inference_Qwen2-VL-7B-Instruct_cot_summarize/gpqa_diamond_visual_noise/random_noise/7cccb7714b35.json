Specifically, the pp-III branch involves the following reactions:\n\n1. \\( p + p \\rightarrow d + \\gamma \\)\n2. \\( d + d \\rightarrow t + \\gamma \\)\n3. \\( t + p \\rightarrow n + \\alpha \\)\n4. \\( \\alpha + p \\rightarrow n + \\gamma \\)\n\nThese reactions produce neutrinos of different energies, with the pp-III branch producing neutrinos in the energy range of 700-800 KeV.\n\nWhen the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos in this energy range stops, but other reactions (such as pp-II and pp-I) continue to produce neutrinos in different energy ranges.\n\nGiven that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 700-800 KeV range, stopping this branch would significantly reduce the flux of neutrinos in this energy band. However, other reactions (pp-II and pp-I) continue to produce neutrinos in different energy ranges.\n\nTo estimate the ratio of the flux between the two bands (700-800 KeV and 800-900 keV), we need to consider the relative contributions of these different reactions.\n\n1. **700-800 KeV Band (pp-III Branch):** This band is directly affected by the stopping of the pp-III branch, leading to a significant reduction in flux.\n2. **800-900 KeV Band (Other Reactions):** This band is produced by other reactions that continue to occur even after the pp-III branch stops.\n\nSince the pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in the 700-800 KeV range, stopping it would drastically reduce the flux in this band. The other reactions (pp-II and pp-I) continue to produce neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, but their contribution is relatively smaller compared to the pp-III branch.\n\nGiven this scenario, the ratio of the flux between the two bands would be very low, as the pp-III branch is the dominant source of neutrinos in the 700-800 KeV range.\n\nTherefore, the approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands (700-800 KeV and 800-900 keV) is:\n\nA. 0.01 (10^-2)."
