The question provides the maximum power radiated (\\( A \\)) and asks for the fraction of \\( A \\) radiated at an angle \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) along with the possible form of \\( f \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the fraction of \\( A \\) radiated at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\). The fraction of \\( A \\) radiated at any angle \\(\\theta\\) is given by the solid angle subtended by that angle. The solid angle \\(\\Omega\\) for an angle \\(\\theta\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Omega = 2\\pi(1 - \\cos\\theta) \\]\n\nFor \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[ \\cos(30^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 - \\cos(30^\\circ) = 1 - \\sqrt{3}/2 = (2 - \\sqrt{3})/2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\Omega = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\pi(2 - \\sqrt{3}) \\]\n\nThe fraction of \\( A \\) radiated at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\Omega}{4\\pi} = \\frac{\\pi(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{4\\pi} = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\approx 0.2679 \\]\n\nThis fraction is approximately \\(1/4\\), so we can eliminate options A and B.\n\nNext, let's consider the form of \\( f \\). The radiated power per unit solid angle \\( f \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ f(\\theta) = \\frac{A}{4\\pi \\Omega} \\]\n\nFor \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[ \\Omega = \\pi(2 - \\sqrt{3}) \\]\n\n\\[ f(\\theta) = \\frac{A}{4\\pi \\pi(2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{A}{4\\pi^2(2 - \\sqrt{3})} \\]\n\nThe form of \\( f \\) is inversely proportional to the solid angle, which is \\(\\lambda^2\\) for a spherical wave. Therefore, \\( f \\) is proportional to \\(\\lambda^{-2}\\).\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. \\(3/4\\), \\(\\lambda^{-6}\\)\nB. \\(1/2\\), \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\)\nC. \\(1/4\\), \\(\\lambda^{-3}\\)\nD. \\(1/4\\), \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\)\n\nThe correct form of \\( f \\) is \\( \\lambda^{-4} \\), and the fraction of \\( A \\) radiated at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) is \\(1/4\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(1/4\\), \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\)"
