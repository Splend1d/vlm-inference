The orbital period \\( T \\) is related to the distance \\( r \\) by the following equation:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\sqrt{r^3} \\]\n\nGiven that the masses of the planets are proportional to their radii cubed (\\( M \\propto r^3 \\)), we can write:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\sqrt{r^3} \\propto \\sqrt{M^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\nSince the masses are proportional to the radii cubed, we can express the masses as:\n\n\\[ M_1 \\propto r_1^3 \\]\n\\[ M_2 \\propto r_2^3 \\]\n\\[ M_3 \\propto r_3^3 \\]\n\nGiven the ratios of the masses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\approx 1.15 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{M_2}{M_3} \\approx 1.35 \\]\n\nWe can express the masses in terms of \\( M_2 \\):\n\n\\[ M_1 = 1.15 M_2 \\]\n\\[ M_3 = \\frac{M_2}{1.35} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the orbital periods \\( T_3 \\) to \\( T_1 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_3}{T_1} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{M_3}{M_1}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the mass ratios:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_3}{T_1} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{M_2}{1.35}}{1.15 M_2}} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_3}{T_1} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1.35 \\times 1.15}} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_3}{T_1} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1.5525}} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_3}{T_1} \\propto \\sqrt{0.643} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_3}{T_1} \\approx 0.8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 0.8 times that of Planet1, which means the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{0.8} \\approx 1.25 \\]\n\nHowever, this does not match any of the provided options.
