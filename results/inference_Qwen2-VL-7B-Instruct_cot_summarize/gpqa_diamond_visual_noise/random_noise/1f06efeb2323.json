A chiral center is a carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups.\n\n1. **Identify the chiral centers:**\n   - A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n   - In the given compound, there is one chiral center at carbon 6, which is bonded to Cl, H, CH3, and CH2CH3.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of stereoisomers:**\n   - For each chiral center, there are 2 possible stereoisomers (R and S configurations).\n   - Since there is only one chiral center, the total number of stereoisomers is 2^1 = 2.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of stereoisomers, not just the configurations. The compound also has a double bond (C=C) which can exist in two different geometrical isomers (cis and trans).\n\n3. **Consider the double bond:**\n   - The double bond at C3 and C7 can exist in cis and trans configurations.\n   - This gives us 2 additional isomers (cis and trans).\n\n4. **Combine the isomers:**\n   - The total number of stereoisomers is the product of the configurations at the chiral center and the geometrical isomers of the double bond.\n   - Therefore, the total number of stereoisomers is 2 (configurations at the chiral center) * 2 (geometrical isomers of the double bond) = 4.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 4"
