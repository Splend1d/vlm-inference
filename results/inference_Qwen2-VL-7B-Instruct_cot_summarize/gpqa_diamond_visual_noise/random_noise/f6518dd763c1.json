The exact structure of the brominated product is not specified, but it will have additional bromine atoms.\n\n2. **Heating with sodium hydroxide**:\n   - Heating the brominated product with sodium hydroxide typically leads to the formation of an alcohol. The exact structure of this alcohol is not specified, but it will have additional hydroxyl groups.\n\n3. **Treatment with thionyl chloride and pyridine**:\n   - Treating the alcohol with thionyl chloride and pyridine leads to the formation of an acid chloride. The exact structure of this acid chloride is not specified, but it will have additional chlorine atoms.\n\n4. **Treatment with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**:\n   - Treating the acid chloride with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride leads to the formation of a product with additional hydrogen atoms. The exact structure of this product is not specified, but it will have additional hydrogens.\n\nGiven the reaction sequence and the structures of the compounds involved, we can infer that product 4 will have additional hydrogen atoms compared to the starting material (cyclohexanone). However, without knowing the exact structure of the intermediate products, we cannot determine the exact number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nSince the question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4, and we know that product 4 will have additional hydrogen atoms compared to the starting material, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 8**"
