                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information step by step and deduce the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n1. **Decolorization of Bromine Water:**\n   - Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, indicating that it contains compounds with double bonds (alkenes or alkenes).\n\n2. **Disproportionation Reaction:**\n   - Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests that the double bonds in mixture X are converted into single bonds in mixture Y.\n\n3. **Hydrogenation:**\n   - Both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions to form a single hydrocarbon Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, indicating that Z is a hydrocarbon with a specific hydrogen-to-carbon ratio.\n   - Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. It does not react further with hydrogen, implying it is saturated.\n\n4. **Conjugated Multiple Bonds:**\n   - Mixture X contains no conjugated multiple bonds, meaning the double bonds are isolated.\n\nGiven that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%, we can calculate the number of hydrogen atoms in Z. Let's denote the number of carbon atoms in Z as \\(n\\). The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mass fraction of hydrogen} = \\frac{2n}{2n + 12}\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 14.28% (or 0.1428 in decimal form):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2n}{2n + 12} = 0.1428\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n2n = 0.1428 \\times (2n + 12)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2n = 0.2856n + 1.7136\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2n - 0.2856n = 1.7136\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1.7144n = 1.7136\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1.7136}{1.7144} \\approx 1\n\\]\n\nThus, Z has 1 carbon atom and 2 hydrogen atoms, making it \\(\\text{CH}_2\\).\n\nSince Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is formed from the hydrogenation of mixture X, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X must be twice that of Z, because each molecule of Z is formed from two molecules of the original mixture X.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nHowever, this does not match any of the given options.
