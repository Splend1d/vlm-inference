Gamma matrices are dimensionless.\n\nThus, the dimension of \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless.\n\nThe dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) can be determined by balancing the dimensions on both sides of the equation. Since \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\), \\(\\psi\\), and \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) are dimensionless, the dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) must also be dimensionless. Therefore, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if it can be made finite by the introduction of counterterms. The given Lagrangian involves the electromagnetic field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\), which is dimensionless. The presence of a dimensionless coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) does not inherently prevent renormalizability. However, the specific form of the Lagrangian and the interactions involved must be examined to determine renormalizability.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. The mass dimension \\(\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = -1\\). The theory is not renormalizable.\nB. The mass dimension \\(\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = -1\\). The theory is renormalizable.\nC. The mass dimension \\(\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = 1\\). The theory is not renormalizable.\nD. The mass dimension \\(\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = 1\\). The theory is renormalizable.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. The mass dimension \\(\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M} = -1\\). The theory is renormalizable."
