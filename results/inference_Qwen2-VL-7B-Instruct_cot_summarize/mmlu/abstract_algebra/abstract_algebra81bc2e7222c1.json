According to Lagrange's theorem, for any finite group \\(G\\) and any subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\), the order (number of elements) of \\(H\\) divides the order of \\(G\\). If \\(G\\) has order \\(n\\), then for every positive divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\), there exists a subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) with order \\(d\\).\n\nStatement 2 is False. The order of an element \\(a\\) in a finite group \\(G\\), denoted \\(|a|\\), is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element of \\(G\\). However, \\(|a|\\) does not necessarily divide \\(|G|\\). For example, in the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_6\\) ( (the integers modulo 6 under addition), the element 2 has order 3, which does not divide 6."
