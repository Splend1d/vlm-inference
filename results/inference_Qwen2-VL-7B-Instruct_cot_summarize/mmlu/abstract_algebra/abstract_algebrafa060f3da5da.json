These vectors are linearly dependent because one is a scalar multiple of the other.\n\nStatement 2 is True. If V is the span of the vectors v1, ..., vk, and {v1, ..., vk} are linearly independent, then the dimension of V (dim(V) is indeed k. This is because the span of a set of linearly independent vectors forms a basis for the vector space, and the number of vectors in this basis is equal to the dimension of the space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
