The condition \\( g(f(a)) = a \\) for all \\( a \\in A \\) does not imply that \\( g \\) is injective. For \\( g \\) to be injective, it must be the case that for any \\( b_1, b_2 \\in B \\), if \\( g(b_1 = g(b_2 \\), then \\( b_1 = b_2 \\). The given condition only ensures that \\( g \\) maps the image of \\( f \\) back to the original set \\( A \\), but it does not provide any information about the mapping of elements in \\( B \\) that are not in the image of \\( f \\).\n\nStatement 2: The function \\( g \\) must necessarily be surjective.\n\nThis statement is true. Since \\( g \\) maps \\( B \\) to \\( A \\) and for all \\( a \\in A \\), \\( g(f(a)) = a \\), it means that every element in \\( A \\) is the image of some element in \\( B \\) under \\( g \\). Therefore, \\( g \\) is surjective.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
