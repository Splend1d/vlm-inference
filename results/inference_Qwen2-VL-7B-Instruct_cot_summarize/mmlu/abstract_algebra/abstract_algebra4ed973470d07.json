For \\( n \\geq 3 \\), \\( s_n \\) is non-Abelian. This is because there exist elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\( s_n \\) such that \\( ab \\neq ba \\). For example, consider the permutations \\( (123 \\) and \\( 231 \\) in \\( s_3 \\). The product \\( (123 \\cdot 231 \\) is \\( 132 \\), but \\( 231 \\cdot 123 \\) is \\( 321 \\). Since the order of multiplication matters, \\( s_n \\) is non-Abelian for all \\( n \\geq 3\\).\n\n### Statement 2: If \\( a \\) is a permutation that is an \\( n \\)-cycle and \\( b \\) is a permutation that is an \\( n \\)-cycle, then \\( |ab| = \\text{lcm}(m,n) \\)\n\nThis statement is not generally true. The order of the product of two permutations \\( ab \\) is not necessarily the least common multiple of their individual orders. The order of the product of two permutations depends on the specific elements involved and their interactions. For example, consider two 3-cycles \\( (123 \\) and \\( 234 \\) in \\( s_4 \\). The product \\( (123 \\cdot 234 \\) is \\( 142 \\), which has an order of 3. However, the least common multiple of 3 and 3 is 3, but the order of the product is not always the least common multiple of the individual orders.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
