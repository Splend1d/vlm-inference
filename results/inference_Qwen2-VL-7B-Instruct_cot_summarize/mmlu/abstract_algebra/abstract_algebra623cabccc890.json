This is because \\(\\sqrt{\\) is a root of the irreducible polynomial \\(x^2 - 2\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q\\).\n\nNext, consider \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})\\). This is also a quadratic extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), as \\(\\sqrt{3\\) is a root of the irreducible polynomial \\(x^2 - 3\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q\\).\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3\\) are linearly independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). If they are, then the degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2), \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) would be the product of the degrees of the individual extensions, which is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\nTo check for linear independence, consider the equation \\(a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3} = 0\\) for some \\(a, b \\in \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). If this equation holds for all \\(a, b \\in \\ \\mathbb{Q}\\), then \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) are linearly dependent. However, there is no rational number \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3} = 0\\), because \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) are algebraically independent over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2), \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 4.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 4."
