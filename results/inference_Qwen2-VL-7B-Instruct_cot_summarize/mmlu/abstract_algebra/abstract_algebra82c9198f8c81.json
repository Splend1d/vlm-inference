                    "text": "To determine the truth of these statements, let's analyze each one individually.\n\n### Statement 1: R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.\n\nA splitting field of a polynomial over a field \\( F \\) is the smallest field extension of \\( F \\) that contains all the roots of the polynomial. For example, if \\( F \\) is the field of rational numbers \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), then a splitting field over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) would be a field that contains all the roots of some polynomial with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\n\n### Statement 2: There is a field with 60 elements.\n\nA finite field (also known as a Galois field, has a number of elements that is a power of a prime number. The number of elements in a finite field \\( \\mathbb{F}_p^n \\) is \\( p^n \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number and \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 1**: For any polynomial with rational coefficients, there exists a splitting field over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). This is true because the splitting field of a polynomial over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is always a finite extension of \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), and such fields exist.\n\n- **Statement 2**: The number 60 is not a power of a prime number. The prime factorization of 60 is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\). Therefore, there cannot be a finite field with 60 elements because the number of elements in a finite field must be a power of a prime number.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
