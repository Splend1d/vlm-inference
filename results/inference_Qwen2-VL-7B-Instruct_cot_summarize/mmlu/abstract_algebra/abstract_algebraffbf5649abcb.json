It is a well-known result in group theory. The proof involves considering the cosets of \\( H \\cap K \\) in \\( H \\) and \\( K \\), and then using the fact that the product of two cosets is a disjoint union of cosets of \\( HK \\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement claims that a group of order \\( 2p \\) where \\( p \\) is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to \\( D_p \\).\n\nThis statement is also a well-known result in group theory. According to the S Sylow's Theorems, a group of order \\( 2p \\) must have a normal subgroup of order \\( 2 \\) ( and a normal subgroup of order \\( p \\). Since \\( p \\) is odd, the group cannot be the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders \\( 2 \\) and \\( p \\) ( because the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders \\( 2 \\) and \\( p \\) would have order \\( 2p \\) and would not be cyclic. Therefore, the group must be cyclic or isomorphic to \\( D_p \\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
