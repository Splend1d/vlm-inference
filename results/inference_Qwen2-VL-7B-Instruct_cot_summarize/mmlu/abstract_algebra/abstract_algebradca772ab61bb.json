Since 25 is relatively prime to 30 (i.e., gcd(25, 30) = 1), the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 is equal to the order of 25 modulo 30.\n\nTo find the order of 25 modulo 30, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $25n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{30$.\n\nWe can start by dividing 30 by 25:\n\n$30 \\div 25 = 1$ remainder $5$\n\nSo, $25 \\times 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{30$.\n\nNext, we divide 25 by 5:\n\n$25 \\div 5 = 5$ remainder $0$\n\nSo, $25 \\times 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{30$.\n\nTherefore, the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 5."
