                    "text": "To determine the truth of these statements, let's analyze each one individually.\n\n### Statement 1: Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. The characteristic of an integral domain is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot 1 = 0 \\) ( (where \\( 0 \\) is the additive identity and \\( 1 \\) is the multiplicative identity). If an integral domain has characteristic 0, it means that no positive integer \\( n \\) satisfies \\( n \\cdot 1 = 0 \\). This implies that the only element that can be added to itself any number of times without ever getting to 0 is the additive identity 0 itself. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean the domain is infinite. For example, the finite integral domain \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) ( where \\( p \\) is a prime number, has characteristic \\( p \\) but is finite. Therefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\n### Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\n\nIf an integral domain has prime characteristic, it means that the characteristic is a prime number \\( p \\). In this case, the domain \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) is a finite integral domain. This is because the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) are precisely the integers modulo \\( p \\), and there are exactly \\( p \\) such elements. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
