This means that all coefficients of the polynomial are reduced modulo 5.\n\nGiven the polynomial \\(x^4 + 4\\), we can rewrite it as \\(x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4\\) since 4 is congruent to 4 modulo 5. Now, let's test the polynomial for roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]\\).\n\n1. **Testing \\(x = 0\\) (** ( \\(0^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\), so \\(x = 0\\) is a root.\n2. **Testing \\(x = 1\\)**. \\( 1^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\), so \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n3. **Testing \\(x = 2\\)**. \\( 2^4 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\), so \\(x = 2\\) is a root.\n4. **Testing \\(x = 3\\)**. \\( 3^4 + 4 = 81 + 4 = 85 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\), so \\(x = 3\\) is a root.\n\nSince we have found four roots, we can express the polynomial as a product of linear factors:\n\n\\[x^4 + 4 = ( (x - 0)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)\\]\n\nSimplifying the factors, we get:\n\n\\[x^4 + 4 = ( x)(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct factorization is:\n\n\\[x^4 + 4 = ( (x - 1)(x + 1)^3\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. ( (x - 1)(x + 1)^3**."
