When you add two polynomials \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) in \\( R[x] \\), the degree of the resulting polynomial \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is not necessarily the maximum of the degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\). Instead, it can be less than the maximum of the degrees if the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) have opposite signs and cancel each other out. For example, consider \\( f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1 \\) and \\( g(x) = -2x^2 + 4x + 5 \\). The degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 2, which is not the maximum of the degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).\n\nStatement 2 is True.\n\nIn a field \\( F \\), every ideal of \\( F[x] \\) is principal. This is a consequence of the fact that \\( F \\) is a field, and fields have the property that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. This property allows for the construction of a principal ideal for any given ideal in \\( F[x] \\). Specifically, if \\( I \\) is an ideal in \\( F[x] \\), then for any polynomial \\( p(x) \\) in \\( I \\), there exists a polynomial \\( q(x) \\) in \\( F[x] \\) such that \\( p(x) = q(x) \\cdot r(x) \\) for some \\( r(x) \\) in \\( F[x] \\). Since \\( F \\) is a field, \\( r(x) \\) has a multiplicative inverse, and thus \\( p(x) \\) can be written as a multiple of a single polynomial, making \\( I \\) a principal ideal."
