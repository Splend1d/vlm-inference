The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) has characteristic 3 because \\( 3 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\n2. The ring \\( 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) is the set of all multiples of 3, which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). The characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is 1 because \\( 1 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nThe characteristic of the product ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of the individual rings. \n\nSince the characteristic of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is 3 and the characteristic of \\( 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) is 1, the LCM of 3 and 1 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times 3\\mathbb{Z} \\) is 3.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 3."
