This is not necessarily true. A homomorphic image of \\( G \\) is the image of \\( G \\) under a homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\rightarrow H \\). The image \\( \\phi(G) \\) is a subgroup of \\( H \\), but it is not necessarily isomorphic to any factor group of \\( G \\). For example, consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) of integers under addition and the homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) defined by \\( \\phi(n) = 2n \\). The image \\( \\phi(\\mathbb{Z}) \\) is \\( 2\\mathbb{Z} \\), which is not isomorphic to any factor group of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nStatement 2 claims that the homomorphic images of a group \\( G \\) are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of \\( G \\). This is true. The factor groups of \\( G \\) are precisely the homomorphic images of \\( G \\) under surjective homomorphisms. In other words, every factor group \\( G / N \\) of \\( G \\) ( where \\( N \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), is isomorphic to the homomorphic image of \\( G \\) under the quotient map \\( \\pi: G \\rightarrow G / N \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
