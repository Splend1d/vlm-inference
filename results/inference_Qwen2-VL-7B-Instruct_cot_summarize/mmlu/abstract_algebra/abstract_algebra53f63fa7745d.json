This is because the left and right cosets of \\(H\\) by \\(a\\) may not be equal. For example, consider the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) ( the integers under addition, and let \\(H = 2\\mathbb{{Z}\\) be the subgroup of even integers. If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(1H = H\\) but \\(H1 = H\\), which shows that \\(aH\\) and \\(Ha\\) are not necessarily equal.\n\nStatement 2 is true. If \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), then for all \\(a\\) in \\(G\\) and \\(h\\) in \\(H\\), \\(ah = ha\\). This is the definition of a normal subgroup. A subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) is normal if and only if for every \\(a\\) in \\(G\\) and \\(h\\) in \\(H\\), \\(ah = ha\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
