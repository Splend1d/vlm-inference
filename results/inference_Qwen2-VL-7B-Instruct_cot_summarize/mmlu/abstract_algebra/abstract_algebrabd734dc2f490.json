The prime factorization of 45 is \\(45 = 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n2. **Subgroups of Order 10:** The order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group by Lagrange's theorem. The divisors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. Among these, 10 is not a divisor of 45.\n3. **Abelian Groups:** For an abelian group of order 45, the structure of the group is determined by its Sylow subgroups. The Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups ( \\(n_5\\) must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities are \\(n_5 = 1\\) or \\(n_5 = 9\\). If \\(n_5 = 1\\), then there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 5-subgroup, which is a subgroup of order 5. If \\(n_5 = 9\\), then there are 9 subgroups of order 5, but none of these can be normal because the group is not cyclic (and hence not abelian).\n\nSince 10 is not a divisor of 45, there cannot be a subgroup of order 10 in an abelian group of order 45.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 1:** False.\n\n### Statement 2: A subgroup \\(H\\) of a group \\(G\\) is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of \\(H\\) is equal to the number of right cosets of \\(H\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Definition of Normal Subgroup:** A subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\) is normal if and only if for every \\(g \\in G\\), the left coset \\(gH\\) equals the right coset \\(Hg\\).\n2. **Number of Cosets Equivalence:** The number of left cosets of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) is equal to the number of right cosets of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) if and only if \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup. This is because the number of left cosets is the index of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\), and the number of right coset is also the index of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\). For a subgroup to be normal, it must be the case that the left coset and right coset counts the same number of cosets.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 2:** True.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
