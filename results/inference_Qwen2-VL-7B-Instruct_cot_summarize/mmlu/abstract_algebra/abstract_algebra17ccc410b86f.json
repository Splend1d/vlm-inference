An ideal is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition and multiplication by any element of the ring, which means it satisfies the properties required for being a subring.\n\nStatement 2 is False. Not every subring of a ring is an ideal of the ring. For a subring to be an ideal, it must be closed under multiplication by any element of the ring. There are cases where a subring is not closed under multiplication by all elements of the ring, thus not satisfying the condition to be an ideal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
