Z_2 represents the finite field with two elements, often denoted as {0, 1} under addition and multiplication modulo 2. \n\nAn extension field of Z_2 would be a field that contains Z_2 and possibly more elements. However, Q, which contains all rational numbers, does not contain Z_2 as a subset. Therefore, Q cannot be an extension field of Z_2.\n\n### Statement 2: Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\n\nThis statement is true. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Since the complex numbers form an extension field over the real numbers, and the real numbers form an extension field over the rational numbers, every non-constant polynomial over a field ( has a zero in some extension field.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Statement 1 is False.\n- Statement 2 is True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
