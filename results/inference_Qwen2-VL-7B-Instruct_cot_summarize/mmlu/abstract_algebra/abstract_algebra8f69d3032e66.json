We need to check if 159 is a prime number or if it has any prime factors. The prime factorization of 159 is:\n\\[ 159 = 3 \\times 53 \\]\n\nSince 159 is not a prime number, it does not immediately follow that the group is cyclic. However, we need to consider the structure of groups of order \\( n = pq \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes. If \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes and \\( p \\equiv q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4 \\), then the group is cyclic. In this case, \\( p = 3 \\) and \\( q = 53 \\), and both are congruent to 1 modulo 4. Therefore, the group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\n### Statement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nThe order of the group is 102. We need to check if 102 is a prime number or if it has any prime factors. The prime factorization of 102 is:\n\\[ 102 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 17 \\]\n\nSince 102 is not a prime number, it does not immediately follow that the group has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. However, we need to consider the structure of groups of order \\( n = pq \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes. If \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes and \\( p \\equiv q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), then the group is cyclic. In this case, \\( p = 2 \\) and \\( q = 17 \\), and both are congruent to 1 modulo 4. Therefore, the group of order 102 is cyclic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
