Let \\( G \\) be a cyclic group generated by an element \\( a \\), so \\( G = \\langle a \\rangle \\). Let \\( \\phi: G \\to H \\) be a homomorphism. Since \\( G \\) is cyclic, it is isomorphic to the integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under \\( \\phi \\) is surjective. \n\nThe homomorphic image \\( H = \\phi(G) \\) is then isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) as well, which is cyclic. Therefore, the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.\n\n### Statement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\n\nAn Abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative. Let \\( G \\) be an Abelian group and \\( \\phi: G \\to H \\) be a homomorphism. Since \\( G \\) is Abelian, for any \\( a, b \\in G \\), we have \\( ab = ba \\).\n\nThe homomorphic image \\( H = \\phi(G) \\) is a subgroup of \\( H \\). Since \\( \\phi \\) is a homomorphism, it preserves the group operation, so for any \\( \\phi(a), \\phi(b) \\in H \\), we have \\( \\phi(a)\\phi(b) = \\phi(ab) = \\phi(ba) = \\phi(b)\\phi(a) \\). This shows that \\( H \\) is also Abelian.\n\nTherefore, the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
