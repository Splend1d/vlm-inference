The image of \\( G \\) under \\( f \\) is the set \\( \\{ f(g) \\mid g \\in \\in G \\ \\ \\). The image of \\( G \\) under \\( f \\) is a subgroup of \\( H \\).\n\nThe order of the image of \\( G \\) under \\( f \\) ( i.e., the number of elements in the image, must divide the order of \\( G \\) by Lagrange's theorem. Since the order of \\( G \\) is 6, the possible orders of the image are 1, 2, 3, or 6 ( (since 6 is the smallest number that divides 6).\n\nTherefore, it is not possible for the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism to have 12 elements. Hence, Statement 1 is False.\n\n### Statement 2: There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\n\nWhile it is not possible for the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism to have 12 elements, it is possible to have a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements to a group of 12 elements. For example, consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) ( (the integers modulo 6) and the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\) ( (the integers modulo 12). There is a natural homomorphism \\( f: \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\) defined by \\( f(a) = 2a \\). This homomorphism maps each element of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) to an element of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\) and preserves the group operation.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
