A homomorphism exists if and only if \\( G' \\) contains an isomorphic copy of \\( G \\), which is not guaranteed for arbitrary groups \\( G \\) and \\( G' \\).\n\nStatement 2 is False. Not every homomorphism is a one-to-one map. A homomorphism can be many-to-one, meaning that multiple elements in the domain can map to the same element in the codomain. For example, consider the homomorphism \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\) defined by \\( f(n) = 0 \\), where \\( a \\) is a fixed integer. This is a homomorphism but is not one-to-one since, for example, \\( f(1) = f(2) = a \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
