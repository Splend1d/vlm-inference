Consider a group where \\(a^2 = b^2\\) for some \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). For example, in the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) ( (the integers modulo 2 under addition), if \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -1\\), then \\(a^2 = 1^2 = 1\\) and \\(b^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\\). Thus, \\(a^2 = b^2\\) even though \\(a \\neq b\\).\n\n### Statement 2\nThe statement is: \"The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\"\n\nThis statement is generally true. The dihedral group \\(D_n\\) of a regular \\(n\\)-gon includes both rotations and reflections. The set of rotations alone forms a subgroup because:\n1. The identity element ( \\(0 \\) ( is a rotation.\n2. The operation of composition of rotations is associative.\n3. For any rotation \\( r \\) and \\( r' \\), the inverse \\( r^{-1} \\) is also a rotation.\n4. The set is closed under the operation of composition of rotations.\n\nMoreover, if the set of rotations is finite ( (i.e., \\( n \\) is finite), then it is cyclic because it can be generated by a single rotation ( \\( r \\) ( (the smallest rotation that generates all others).\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is generally false.\n- Statement 2 is generally true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
