The rank of a free abelian group is the number of elements in its basis. \n\n- If a free abelian group has a finite rank, say \\( n \\), then it can be written as \\( \\mathbb{Z}^a \\). The number of bases for \\( \\mathbb{Z}^a \\) is \\( a \\), which is finite.\n- If a free abelian group has an infinite rank, then it can be written as \\( \\mathbb{Z}^{\\aleph_0} \\), where \\( \\aleph_0 \\) is the cardinality of the natural numbers. The number of bases for \\( \\mathbb{Z}^{\\aleph_0} \\) is also infinite.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true because every nonzero free abelian group, whether of finite or infinite rank, has an infinite number of bases.\n\n### Statement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\n\n- If a free abelian group has a rank of 2 or more, it can be written as \\( \\mathbb{Z}^a \\) where \\( a \\geq 2 \\). The number of bases for \\( \\mathbb{Z}^a \\) is \\( a \\), which is at least 2 and thus infinite.\n- The number of bases for a free abelian group of rank at least 2 is infinite because the rank itself is at least 2, and the number of bases is equal to the rank.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true because every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
