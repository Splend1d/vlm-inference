Fermat's Little Theorem states that if \\(p\\) is a prime number and \\(a\\) is any integer not divisible by \\(p\\), then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(p = 23\\) ( which is a prime number, and \\(a = 3\\). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\mod 23\\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\(3^{47} \\mod 23\\). We can express \\(47\\) as \\(22 \\times 2 + 3\\), so \\(3^{47} = 3^{22 \\times 2 + 3} = ( (3^{22})^2 \\times 3^3\\).\n\nWe know that \\(3^{22} \\equiv 1 \\mod 23\\), so \\((3^{22})^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 23\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(3^{47} \\equiv 1 \\times 3^3 \\mod 23\\).\n\nNow, we just need to calculate \\(3^3 \\mod 23\\):\n\n\\(3^3 = 27\\)\n\n\\(27 \\mod 23 = 4\\)\n\nSo, the remainder of \\(3^{47}\\) when divided by 23 is \\(4\\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 4."
