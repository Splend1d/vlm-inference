This is because the subgroup property ensures that \\(K\\) is closed under addition and scalar multiplication by integers, and it inherits the free structure from the larger group. Therefore, \\(K\\) is indeed free abelian.\n\n### Statement 2\n\"If \\(K\\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\(G / K\\) is free abelian.\"\n\nThe quotient group \\(G / K\\) is defined as the set of cosets of \\(K\\) in \\(G\\), where \\(G\\) is the finitely generated free abelian group. The quotient group \\(G / K\\) is free abelian if and only if \\(K\\) is a free abelian group of finite rank.\n\nHowever, the statement does not specify that \\(K\\) is of finite rank. For \\(G / K\\) to be free abelian, \\(K\\) must be a free abelian group of finite rank. Without this condition, \\(G / K\\) might not be free abelian.\n\n### Conclusion\nStatement 1 is true because any subgroup of a free abelian group is itself free abelian.\nStatement 2 is false because \\(G / K\\) being free abelian requires \\(K\\) to be of finite rank, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
