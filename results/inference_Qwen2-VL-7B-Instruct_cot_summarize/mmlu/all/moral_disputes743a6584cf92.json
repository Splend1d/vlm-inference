Liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees.\n- This option suggests that Carens believes liberal egalitarianism advocates for a more open immigration policy. This alignss with Carens's views on the subject.\n\nB. Liberal egalitarianism, contrary to appearances, entails that only closed border immigration policies are acceptable.\n- This option suggests that Carens believes liberal egalitarianism supports closed border policies. This contradicts Carens's views.\n\nC. Egalitarianism is founded on sentiments of envy and is therefore unjustified.\n- This option suggests that Carens believes egalitarianism is unjustified due to its foundation in envy. This is not a central theme in Carens's arguments.\n\nD. Liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism do not succeed.\n- This option suggest that Carens believes liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism are unsuccessful. This is not a central theme in Carens's arguments.\n\nGiven the analysis, the main conclusion that Carens is likely to support is:\n\nA. Liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is A."
