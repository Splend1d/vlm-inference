The study showed that monkeys reared by artificial mothers that provided physical comfort but lacked social interaction were less likely to form social bonds and were more prone to aggression and anxiety.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications for humans:\n\nI. Emotional and psychological well-being: The study suggests that touch and social interaction are crucial for emotional and psychological well-being in humans as well. This implies that providing physical comfort and social interaction is important for human emotional and psychological development.\n\n II. Social bonding: The study indicates that social bonding is essential for humans. This implies that humans need to form social bonds to thrive emotionally and psychologically.\n\n III. Aggression and anxiety: The study shows that lack of social interaction can lead to aggression and anxiety in humans. This implies that social interaction is necessary to prevent aggression and anxiety in humans.\n\nGiven this analysis, the implications of Harlow's study for humans include all three points: emotional and psychological well-being, social bonding, and preventing aggression and anxiety.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and II only"
