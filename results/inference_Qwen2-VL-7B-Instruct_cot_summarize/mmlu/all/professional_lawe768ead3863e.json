The daughter lived with the wife, but the husband frequently visited his daughter at her house. One morning, the husband came to his ex-wife's home to see his daughter. He and his daughter were outside on the patio chatting when the wife noticed her ex-husband's briefcase lying on the kitchen floor. The husband had entered the house carrying his briefcase, which he placed down before going out to see his daughter on the patio. Seeing the briefcase, the wife decided to open it. Inside she found a large envelope. She decided to keep it, thinking it contained money. Later that night after her ex-husband left, she opened the envelope and found a large amount of cocaine. The wife called the police who came and confiscated the drugs. The husband was subsequently charged with possession of cocaine. The husband has filed a motion to exclude the cocaine from being introduced into evidence. His motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the seizure violated the husband's right of privacy.\nB. granted, because the police failed to secure a search warrant before the seizure of the cocaine.\nC. denied, because the initial seizure was made by a private individual.\nD. denied, because the husband left the briefcase in the kitchen in plain view.\n"

The wife did not violate any privacy rights or fail to secure a search warrant; she simply found the briefcase and opened it, discovering the cocaine. The fact that the husband left the briefcase in plain view means that it was not a violation of his privacy rights, and the police did not need a search warrant to seize the drugs."
