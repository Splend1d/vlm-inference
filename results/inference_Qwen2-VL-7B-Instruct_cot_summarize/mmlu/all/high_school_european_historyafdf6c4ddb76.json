Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration is de las Casas most likely to think is most important in Source 2?\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity\nB. Financial gain\nC. Personal glory\nD. Finding new mates\n"

The text states that the Spanish have an \"ultimate aim\" to acquire gold and rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits. This.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity - This is mentioned in Source 1, where Columbus describes his efforts to convert the Indians to Christianity. However, this is not the primary focus of Source 2.\n\nB. Financial gain - This is explicitly mentioned in Source 2 as the ultimate aim of the Spanish, which aligns with the description of their brutal treatment of the indigenous population.\n\nC. Personal glory - While personal glory might be a motive for some explorers, it is not explicitly mentioned in Source 2.\n\nD. Finding new mates - This is not mentioned in Source 2 at all.\n\nGiven the information in Source 2, the motive for exploration that de las Casas is most likely to think is most important is:\n\nB.
