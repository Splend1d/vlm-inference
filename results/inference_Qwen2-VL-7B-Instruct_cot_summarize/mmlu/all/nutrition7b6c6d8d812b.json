Living on a working farm will help reduce the development of atopic diseases\n\nThis hypothesis posits that a lack of exposure to certain microorganisms during early childhood, often due to improved sanitary conditions and reduced family size, can lead to an increased risk of developing allergic conditions later in life. In contrast, exposure to certain microorganisms, as might occur on a working farm, can help to modulate the immune system and reduce the risk of developing allergies."
