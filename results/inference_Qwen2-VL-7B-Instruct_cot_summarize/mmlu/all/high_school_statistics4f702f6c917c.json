The probability of winning on a single trial is the probability of the ball landing on a red slot, which is 18/38.\n\nThe probability of losing 7 times in a row is ( (20/38)^7. The probability of winning on the 8th trial is 18/38.\n\nSo, the probability of losing 7 straight times before winning the first time is ( (20/38)^7 * (18/38).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n(20/38)^7 * (18/38) = 0.0053\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 0.0053."
