At trial, the government was allowed to present the testimony of several women who testified to having flirtatious or sexual encounters with the defendant over the past 20 years prior to the homicide. None of the testimony showed any such activity within three years of the murder date, and none of it showed any violent tendencies of the defendant or intentions expressed that he wanted to kill his wife. The defendant had an alibi for the time of the crime and presented many alibi witnesses. The government claimed that it was showing motive by proving the defendant's proclivity for extra-marital affairs over the years and therefore his bad relationship with his wife. The jury convicted him after hearing the testimony of 10 women regarding defendant's various sexual contacts with them over prior years. The defendant appealed the murder conviction, claiming that the women's testimony was prejudicial and inflammatory and showed only bad character, which is not admissible under evidentiary rules. Will the appeals court likely reverse the conviction and order a new trial?\n\nA. Yes, the trial was unfair in presenting testimony of women going back over 20 years; it would have been proper to admit such testimony only as to the five years preceding the crime.\nB. Yes, the defendant did not receive a fair trial; the testimony of the women only showed his bad character but because they were old incidents and not continuing, they did not allow a permissible inference that these affairs gave him a motive to kill his spouse.\nC. No, if the testimony was admitted in error it was harmless error that did not sway the jury one way or another and so the defendant got a fair trial in all other respects.\nD. No, the testimony was admissible because it tended to show a pattern of \"transferred intent\" that proved the defendant's great hostility to his wife, and his need to eliminate her from his life so that he could go back to having a wild life.\n"

                    "text": "The appeals court is likely to reverse the conviction and order a new trial. This conclusion is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Relevance and Proportionality of Testimony**: The testimony of the women regarding the defendant's sexual encounters over the past 20 years is highly prejudicial and inflammatory. It is not directly relevant to the issue of motive in the murder case. The government's attempt to establish motive by showing the defendant's proclivity for extra-marital affairs over the years is not a permissible inference. The testimony does not show any violent tendencies or intentions to kill the defendant's estranged wife.\n\n2. **Evidentiary Rules**: The defendant's appeal is based on the argument that the testimony was prejudicial and inflammatory and showed only bad character, which is not admissible under evidentiary rules. The appeals court is likely to agree with this argument, as the testimony does not meet the standards for admissibility under the rules of of evidence.\n\n3. **Motive and Intent**: The government's claim that the defendant's past sexual encounters with other women show a pattern of transferred intent and hostility towards his estranged wife is not supported by the evidence presented. The lack of any violent tendencies or intentions to kill within three years of the murder date undermines the government's argument.\n\n4. **Alibi and Witnesses**: The defendant presented an alibi for the time of the crime and presented many alibi witnesses. The government's attempt to undermine the alibi by presenting old incidents of sexual encounters is not a valid basis for conviction.\n\nGiven these points, the appeals court is likely to conclude that the testimony was prejudicial and inflammatory and did not contribute to the determination of the defendant's guilt. Therefore, the conviction will be reversed, and a new trial will be ordered. \n\n**Option B** is the most likely choice, as it acknowledges the prejudicial nature of the testimony and the lack of a permissible inference that the defendant's past sexual encounters gave him a motive to kill his estranged wife."
