This principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. In the case of the helium atom, the ortho- state has two electrons with parallel spins, which is allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle. The para- state, on the other hand, has two electrons with antiparallel spins, which is not allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, the para- state has a higher energy than the ortho- state.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The Pauli exclusion principle"
