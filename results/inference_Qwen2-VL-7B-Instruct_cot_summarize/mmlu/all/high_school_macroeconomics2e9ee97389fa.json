Lower interest rates in the United States relative to China.\n\nWhen interest rates are lower in the United States compared to China, investors tend to move their funds to China in search of higher returns. This increased demand for Chinese yuan leads to an appreciation of the yuan relative to the dollar. \n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nB. Lower price levels in China relative to the United States: This would likely lead to a depreciation of the yuan, as it would make Chinese goods cheaper and less attractive to foreign buyers.\n\nC. Growing American preference to consume more Chinese-made goods: This would increase demand for Chinese yuan, leading to an appreciation of the yuan.\n\nD. Rising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States: This would increase demand for the dollar, leading to an appreciation of the dollar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
