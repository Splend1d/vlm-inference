This paragraph should explain that the projections are based on certain assumptions and that the actual results may differ from the projections due to various factors, such as changes in market conditions, economic conditions, and other uncertainties. The paragraph should also state that the projections are not a guarantee of future performance and that the accountant does not provide any assurance on the accuracy or completeness of the projections."
