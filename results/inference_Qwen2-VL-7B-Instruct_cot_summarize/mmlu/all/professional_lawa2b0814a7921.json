The letter stated, \"I want to sell my antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. If you are interested please contact me.\" Three days later Bobby sent a letter to Susan stating \"I agree to pay your asking price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster.\" The next day Susan sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. If Bobby brings suit against Susan for breach of contract, the likely outcome is\n\nA. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mail box rule.\nB. For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\nC. For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\nD. For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n"

For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**: Susan's letter to Bobby was an offer to sell the antique 1932 Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. Bobby's letter acceptinging the offer was timely under the mail box rule, which states that an offer is accepted when the acceptance is mailed and reaches the offeror within a reasonable time.\n\n2. **Sale to Harriett**: Before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted her offer, she sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. This means that Susan had already sold the car to Harriet before she was aware that Bobby had accepted her offer.\n\n3. **Breach of Contract**: Since Susan had already sold the car to Harriet Higherprice before she was aware that Bobby had accepted her offer, she is in breach of contract with Bobby. The sale to Harriet Higherprice means that Susan has failed to fulfill her obligation to sell the car to Bobby at the agreed price.\n\nTherefore, the likely outcome is that the court would rule in favor of Susan, as she breached the contract by selling the car to Harriet Higherprice before she was aware that Bobby had accepted her offer."
