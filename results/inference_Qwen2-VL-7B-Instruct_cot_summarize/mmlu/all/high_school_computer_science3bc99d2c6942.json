If the middle element is the target value, the search is complete. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the list; if the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the list. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.\n\nGiven a sorted list of 500 elements, the maximum number of elements that will be examined during a binary search is when the target value is not present in the list. In this case, the binary search will continue to divide the list in half until it has examined the last element of the list.\n\nSince the list has 500 elements, the maximum number of elements that will be examined is 500.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 500"
