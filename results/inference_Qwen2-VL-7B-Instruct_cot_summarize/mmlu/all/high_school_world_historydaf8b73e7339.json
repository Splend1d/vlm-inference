You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nWhich of the following does the poem provide direct evidence for in its discussion of taxation in the third stanza?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which of the following options the poem provides direct evidence for in its discussion of taxation in the third stanza, let's analyze the content of the stanza and the options provided.\n\nThe third stanza of the poem discusses the hardships faced by soldiers and the impact of taxation on the local population. Specifically, it mentions:\n\n- The soldiers' long tours of duty and the constant call-ups.\n- The village headman's task of tying bandannas for the soldiers.\n- The soldiers' return with white hair, indicating their age and the toll of their service.\n- The frontier garrisons being run with blood, suggesting heavy casualties.\n- The emperor's territorial ambitions and the unrest in the land.\n- The infestation of villages with brambles.\n- The difficulty in farming due to the soldiers' absence.\n- The round-up of Shanxi men for military service.\n- The District Officers demanding land tax.\n- The difficulty in collecting taxes, as it is \"like trying to get blood from a stone.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level\n- The stanza mentions the District Officers demanding land tax, but it does not provide direct evidence of the strength of the bureaucracy. The stanza focuses more on the difficulties of collecting taxes rather than the strength of the bureaucracy.\n\nB. The Tang Dynasty's large, standing professional army with no need of conscription\n- The stanza does not provide evidence for a standing professional army. Instead, it discusses the conscription of of soldiers and the constant call-ups.\n\nC. Relatively advanced Tang agricultural technologies\n- The stanza does not provide any information about the level of agricultural technologies. It focuses on the difficulties in farming due to the soldiers' absence.\n\nD. The relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China\n- The stanza does not provide any information about the level of urbanization. It focuses on the difficulties faced by the soldiers and the local population, particularly regarding taxation and farming.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the options directly provide evidence from the stanza. However, the stanza does highlight the difficulties in collecting taxes, which could be interpreted as a reflection of the complexity and challenges faced by the Tang Dynasty's tax system.\n\nThe most fitting option, considering the context and the focus on the difficulties of collecting taxes, is:\n\nA. The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level\n\nThis option is the most aligned with the stanza's discussion of the District Officers demanding land tax and the difficulty in collecting taxes.\n\nFinal answer: A. The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level"
