A counterexample is a situation where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nLet's construct the truth table:\n\n| C | D | ~C | ~C \u2283 D | D \u2283 C | C |\n|---|---|----|--------|-------|---|\n| T | T | F  | T      | T     | T |\n| T | F | F  | T      | F     | T |\n| F | T | T  | T      | T     | F |\n| F | F | T  | T      | T     | F |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table:\n\n1. When C is true and D is true, the premises ~C \u2283 D and D \u2283 C are both true, but the conclusion C is also true. This is not a counterexample because the conclusion is true.\n2. When C is true and D is false, the premises ~C \u2283 D and D \u2283 C are both false, but the conclusion C is true. This is a counterexample because the conclusion is true, but the premises are false.\n3. When C is false and D is true, the premises ~C \u2283 D and D \u2283 C are both true, but the conclusion C is false. This is not a counterexample because the conclusion is false.\n4. When C is false and D is false, the premises ~C \u2283 d and D \u2283 C are both true, but the conclusion C is false. This is not a counterexample because the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid. The counterexample is when C is true and D is false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Invalid.
