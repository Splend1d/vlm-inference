In this case, the bank is required to hold $250 out of $1000 in checking deposits, so the reserve ratio is 25%.\nThe excess reserves are the amount of reserves that a bank has in excess of the required reserves. In this case, the bank has $750 in excess reserves ($1000 - $250).\nThe money multiplier is the amount of money that is created in the economy as a result of the initial deposit. In this case, the money multiplier is 4, which means that for every $1 deposited in the bank, $4 is created in the economy.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 25% $750 M = 4."
