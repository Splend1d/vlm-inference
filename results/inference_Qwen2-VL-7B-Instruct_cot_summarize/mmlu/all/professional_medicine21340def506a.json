Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options\n\nGiven the patient's history of type 1 diabetes mellitus with poor control, the recent onset of symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, feelings of hopelessness, and noncompliance with his diabetic regimen, it is important to address his concerns and discuss potential home-care options. This approach respects the patient's autonomy while ensuring that his health and well-being are prioritized. It is also important to continue to monitor his glucose levels and ensure that he is receiving appropriate medical care."
