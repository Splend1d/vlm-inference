The original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long, and the new picture is 10 cm wide. \n\nFirst, we find the scale factor for the width:\n\\[ \\text{Scale factor for width} = \\frac{\\text{New width}}{\\text{Original width}} = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \\]\n\nSince the enlargement is proportional, the scale factor for the length will be the same as the scale factor for the width. Therefore, we can find the new length by multiplying the original length by the scale factor:\n\\[ \\text{New length} = \\text{Original length} \\times \\text{Scale factor} = 6 \\times 2.5 = 15 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nSo, the length of the new picture is 15 cm.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 15 cm"
