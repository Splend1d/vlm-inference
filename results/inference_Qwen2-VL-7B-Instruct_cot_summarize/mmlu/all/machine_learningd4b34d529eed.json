Layer Normalization was introduced later in the literature. Therefore, this statement is **False**.\n\n2. **Statement 2| DCGan's use self-attention to stabilize training.**\n   - DCGan's ( (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) do not use self-attention. Self-attention is a technique that was introduced later, primarily in the context of transformers and attention mechanisms in natural language processing. DCGan's use techniques like batch normalization and residual connections to stabilize training, but self-attention is not part of their architecture. Therefore, this statement is **False**.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
