Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years.\n\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in the global defence trade by advocating for arms control measures, raising awareness about the impacts of arms trade, and supporting initiatives that aim to reduce the proliferation of weapons. They often work alongside governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders to develop and implement policies that promote peace and security. NGOs can provide critical insights and grassroots perspectives that can influence policy decisions and contribute to more effective arms control measures."
