The neighbor who owns property adjacent to the farm knows of the friends' use of the property during the hunting season. One day during the hunting season, without the farmer's knowledge or permission, the neighbor took a shortcut across the farm to visit an acquaintance. The neighbor was wounded by a shot fired by one of the farmer's friends, who was shooting at quail and carelessly failed to see the neighbor. Traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability apply. In an action by the neighbor against the farmer to recover for the injuries, will the neighbor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing.\nC. Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.\nD. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\nUnder traditional rules of landowners' and occupier's liability, a landowner is generally not liable for injuries caused by third parties activities on their property unless they have assumed a duty of care towards the injured party. However, if the activity is considered \"abnormally dangerous,\" the landowner may be held liable even if they did not assume a duty of care.\n\nIn this case, the use of firearms during hunting season can be considered an abnormally dangerous activity. The neighbor was not a trespasser but rather a person who had a right to be on the property ( as the neighbor's property was adjacent to the farm. The neighbor was not aware of the hunting activity and was not given any instructions about gun safety. The careless friend's conduct was not an intentional act, but it was a foreseeable risk of harm that the farmer should have taken reasonable steps to mitigate.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor is likely to prevail in an action against the farmer to recover for the injuries."
