To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?\n\nA. The sample sizes are different.\nB. The sample sizes are too large.\nC. The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.\nD.

The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.\n\nA two-proportion z-test is used to compare the proportions of successes in two independent groups. For this test to be appropriate, the number of successes and failures in each group should be large enough to approximate a normal distribution. In this case, the number of successes ( (66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code) and the number of failures ( (70 females do not oppose the dress code and 10 males do not oppose the dress code) should be large enough to ensure that the sampling distribution of the difference in proportions is approximately normal. If the number of successes and failures are too small, the test may not be appropriate."
