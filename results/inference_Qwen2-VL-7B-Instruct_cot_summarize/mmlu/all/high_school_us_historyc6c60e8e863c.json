It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nIn what way did the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 contradict Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine how Abraham Lincoln's actions in 1861 contradicted Frederick Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt, we need to carefully analyze Douglass's views and Lincoln's policies.\n\nDouglass's excerpt highlights the advantages of the slaveholders, including their complete organization, the support of state and church organizations, and the Federal Government's pledge to defend slavery. He emphasizes that the Federal Government, with its army, navy, and judiciary, is aligned with slavery.\n\nNow, let's examine each option to see how Lincoln's actions might contradict Douglass's sentiments:\n\nA. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\n- This option suggests that Lincoln allowed settlers to decide the status of slavery in new territories. This could be seen as a contradiction because it would allow for the expansion of slavery, which Douglass opposed.\n\nB. Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\n- The Homestead Act was about providing land to settlers, not about slavery. It does not directly address the issue of slavery or its expansion.\n\nC. Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.\n- This option suggests that Lincoln wanted to prevent slavery from spreading into new territories. This aligns with Douglass's sentiments, as he was against the expansion of slavery.\n\nD. Lincoln enacted the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule.\"\n- This option suggests that Lincoln provided land to freed slaves. While this was a significant step towards freeing slaves, it does not directly address the issue of slavery's expansion into new territories.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best contradicts Douglass's sentiments is:\n\nA. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\n\nThis option directly contradicts Douglass's view that the Federal Government should not support the expansion of slavery."
