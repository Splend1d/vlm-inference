Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nWhich other nineteenth-century reform movement made similar arguments to those written here by Susan B.

Anthony in the context of the abolition movement. Both movements emphasized the interconnectedness of the struggle for justice and equality, and the idea that injustice in one place affects all people everywhere. The abolition movement argued that the institution of of slavery was not just a problem in the southern states, but a national issue that affected all Americans. Similarly, King argued that the struggle for civil rights was not just a problem in the southern states, but a national issue that affected all Americans."
