This is because the firing angle is the angle at which the thyristor is turned on, and it can be turned on anywhere from the beginning of the cycle (0\u00b0) to the end of the cycle (180\u00b0).\n\nIn this case, the load counter emf is 200 V, which is half of the source voltage (400 V. This suggests that the thyristor is turned on at the midpoint of the cycle, which is 90\u00b0. Therefore, the firing angle control range is from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0."
