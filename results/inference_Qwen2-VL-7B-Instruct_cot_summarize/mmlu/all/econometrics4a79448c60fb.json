(i) and (iii) only.\n\nIf the number of replications used in a Monte Carlo study is small, the following statements will be true:\n\ni) The statistic of interest may be estimated imprecisely - This is true because with fewer replications, the variability in the estimates increases, leading to less precise estimates.\n\nii) The results may be affected by unrepresentative combinations of random draws - This is not necessarily true. The quality of the results depends on the randomness and independence of the draws, not just the number of replications.\n\niii) The standard errors on the estimated quantities may be unacceptably large - This is true because with fewer replications, the standard errors of of the estimates tend to be larger, which can make the results less reliable.\n\niv) Variance reduction techniques can be used to reduce the standard errors - This is true, but it is not a consequence of having a small number of replications. Variance reduction techniques can be applied regardless of the number of replications.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
