As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?\n\nA. No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.\nB. No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\nC. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. \u0080\u0083\n"

The fact that the doors closed on the patient's foot and caused further injury does not, by itself, establish negligence on the part of the hospital. The hospital has no duty to maintain the automatic doors in a perfect state of repair, and the patient has not shown that the hospital's failure to do so was the proximate cause of the injury."
