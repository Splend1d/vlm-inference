It argues against the government's role in providing aid to the poor, suggesting that such actions would be a reversal of the government's role and would infringe on individual freedom.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor.\"\n     - The passage does not explicitly mention the use of tax money. It focuses on the principle that the government should not provide aid beyond protection.\n   - **Option B**: \"Challenged the government's right to tax the people.\"\n     - The passage does not discuss the government's right to tax people. It is about the government's role in providing aid.\n   - **Option C**: \"Believed that the government should do more than merely protect its people.\"\n     - The passage explicitly states that the government should not do more than protect its people, which directly contradicts this option.\n   - **Option D**: \"Believed that working people should unite for a common cause.\"\n     - The passage does not discuss the unity of of working people or any common cause. It is focused on the government's role in providing aid.\n\n4. **Conclude with a clear answer**: Based on the analysis, the passage clearly states that Spencer believed the government should not provide aid beyond protection. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor**"
