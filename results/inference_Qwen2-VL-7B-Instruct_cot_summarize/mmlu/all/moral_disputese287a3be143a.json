Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Immanuel Kant\n- Kant is known for his deontological ethics, which focuses on the duty and moral rules rather than the consequences of actions. He did not explicitly advocate for the equal consideration of interests of all beings, including non-human animals.\n\nB. Aristotle\n- Aristotle's ethics were based on the concept of the \"golden mean,\" which involves finding a balance between extremes. He did not explicitly address the principle of equal consideration of interests in the same way that it is understood today, particularly in terms of extending it to non-human animals.\n\nC. Jeremy Bentham\n- Bentham was a utilitarian philosopher who proposed the principle of \"utility,\" which suggests that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness and wrong as they tend to produce the opposite of happiness. He argued that all beings have interests and that these interests should be considered equally. This alignss with the idea of equal consideration of interests, including those of non-human animals.\n\nD. John Stuart Mill\n- Mill was a utilitarian philosopher who developed the concept of \"higher and lower pleasures.\" He did not explicitly advocate for the equal consideration of interests of all beings, including non-human animals.\n\nBased on the analysis, Jeremy Bentham was one of the few historical defenders of the principle of equal consideration of interests who recognized that the principle applies to members of other species as well as to our own.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Jeremy Bentham"
