Extension**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **A. ad ignorantium (** This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something is true or false based on a lack of knowledge or information about it.\n- **B. Many questions.** This term does not refer to a specific logical fallacy.\n- **C. Extension** is the fallacy of assuming that because something is not true in one context, it it is not true in another context. In your scenario, you are arguing that something is flawed because it fails to do something it was never intended to do, which is an example of assuming that the intended use is the only relevant context.\n- **D. Compound proposition** is a logical structure in which two or more propositions are combined into a single compound proposition, which is not the fallacy you are describing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Extension."
