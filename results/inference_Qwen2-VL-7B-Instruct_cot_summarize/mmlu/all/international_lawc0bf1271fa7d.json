The situation is not clear-cut but an act of parliament would most probably be required\n\nIn English law, the incorporation of customary crimes into domestic law is not straightforward. While customary international law can influence domestic law, it is not automatically incorporated into English law. The courts may consider customary law in their decisions, but this is not a formal process of incorporation. Therefore, an act of parliament would most likely be required to formally incorporate a customary crime into English law."
