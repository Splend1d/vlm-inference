Vegan diets, which exclude all animal products, may be deficient in certain amino acids, including some essential ones like lysine and methionine, depending on the specific foods included.\n\nB. Cereals are deficient in lysine\n- This statement is not true. While some cereals grains (like corn and rice) are low in lysine, many cereals grains (like wheat and oats) are not deficient in lysine. Therefore, this statement is misleading.\n\nC. Legumes are deficient in methionine\n- This statement is generally true. Legumes are typically low in methionine, an essential amino acid, which is why they are often combined with cereals grains to provide a complete protein.\n\nD. Dairy products are rich source of tryptophan\n- This statement is true. Dairy products, including milk, cheese, and yogurt, are good sources of tryptophan, an essential amino acid.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is not true is:\n\nB. Cereals are deficient in lysine"
