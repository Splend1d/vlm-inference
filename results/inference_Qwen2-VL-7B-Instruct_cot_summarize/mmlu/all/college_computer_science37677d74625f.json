Given a positive integer \\( n \\), we can check if the computation \\( C \\) reaches at least \\( n \\) steps. This can be done by simulating the Turing machine \\( M \\) for \\( n \\) steps and checking if the tape head has moved beyond the \\( n \\)-th step.\n\n### Problem II: The computation \\( C \\) lasts for at least \\( n \\) steps, and \\( M \\) prints a 1 at some point after the \\( n \\)-th step.\nThis problem is also decidable. We can simulate the computation of \\( M \\) step by step and check if the machine prints a 1 after the \\( n \\)-th step. This can be done by simulating the Turing machine \\( M \\) for \\( n \\) steps and then checking the output tape.\n\n### Problem III: \\( M \\) scans at least \\( n \\) distinct tape squares during the computation \\( C \\).\nThis problem is decidable. We can simulate the computation of \\( M \\) step by step and keep track of the number of distinct tape squares that the head has visited. If the number of distinct squares visited is at least \\( n \\), then the problem is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll three problems (I, ii, and iii) are decidable because we can simulate the computation of \\( M \\) step by step and check the conditions specified in each problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and III only**"
