This area is a right triangle with base and height of 3 units ( (since the line \\( y = x \\) intersects the rectangle at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\)).\n\nThe area of this triangle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\) square units.\n\nThe probability that \\( x < y \\) is the ratio of the area where \\( x < y \\) to the total area of the rectangle:\n\n\\[ P(x < y) = \\frac{\\frac{9}{2}}{12} = \\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{3}{8} \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options directly.
