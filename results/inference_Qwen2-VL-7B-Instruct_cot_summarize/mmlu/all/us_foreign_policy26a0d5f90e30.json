This system was designed to create a more centralized and efficient government, which was seen as a departure from the more decentralized and fragmented political systems of Europe at the time. This emphasis on centralization and efficiency was seen as a way to create a more effective and efficient government, which was in line with the idea of American exceptionalism, which emphasizes the unique and superior qualities of the United States.
