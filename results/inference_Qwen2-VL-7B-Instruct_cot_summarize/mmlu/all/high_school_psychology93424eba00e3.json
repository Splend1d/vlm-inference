Longitudinal studies can be time-consuming and expensive, as they require repeated measurements over a long period.\n II. Longitudinal studies can be subject to attrition, meaning that participants may drop out over time, leading to a loss of data.\n III. Longitudinal studies can be subject to changes in the environment or societal factors that may influence the results.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider the options:\n\nA. I only: This would mean that only time is a disadvantage. However, both I and II are disadvantages.\nB. II only: This would mean that only II is a disadvantage. However, both I and II are disadvantages.\nC. III only: This would mean that only III is a disadvantage. However, both I and II are disadvantages.\nD. I and II only: This would mean that both I and II are disadvantages. This is correct because both time time-consuming and expensive nature and attrition are disadvantages of longitudinal studies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and II only"
