It is not practicable to present every participant with all the information about the study. Participants may have varying levels of understanding and comprehension, and the amount of information that can be presented in a single session may be limited.\n\nB. Sometimes it is desirable to withhold certain pieces of information, such as the length of time an interview will take. This can be done to protect the confidentiality of the study or to prevent participants from being deterred by the length of the interview.\n\nC. If the participants knew exactly what the researcher was intending to study, they might change their behavior. This is known as the Hawthorne effect, where participants alter their behavior in response to being observed or studied. This can affect the validity of the study results.\n\nTherefore, all of the above reasons can make it \"easier said than done\" to ensure that the principle of informed consent is adhered to."
