On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires\nB. While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope\nC. Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such\nD.

                    "text": "The major difference between naturalism and positivism lies in their philosophical and methodological approaches to understanding and interpreting the world, particularly in the context of international law and society.\n\nNaturalism, often associated with the natural law tradition, posits that there are inherent moral and ethical principles that are universally applicable and objective. These principles are seen as inherent in human nature and are not dependent on human-made laws or societal norms. Natural law theorists argue that these principles provide a foundation for moral and legal norms, and that laws should be based on these universal moral principles.\n\nPositivism, on the other hand, is a legal theory that emphasizes the importance of the rules and norms that are created and recognized by human societies, particularly through the legal systems of states. Positivists legal theory holds that the validity of laws is determined by their acceptance and recognition by the state, rather than by their inherent moral or ethical content. Positivism focuses on the structure and coherence of legal systems and the role of the state in creating and enforcing laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such"
