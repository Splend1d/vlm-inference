The man notified his insurance carrier but was told that his policy had lapsed on July 2. He had earlier received a renewal notice with a bill listing a due date of June 28 and an expiration date of the policy on July 2. The notice welcomed payment by mail, and did not say that renewal was conditioned on actual physical receipt of the check. He had put the check and form in the U.S. mail on June 28, but the insurer did not receive it until July 5. The insurer reinstated the policy as of July 5, leaving a coverage gap from July 2 through July 5, according to the company. Will the courts likely hold that the policy was still effective on July 3, the date of the accident?\n\nA. Yes, because the renewal premium was placed in the mailbox before the date of expiration, and the notice did not say that the check had to be received physically before there could be a renewal.\nB. Yes, because a policy cannot be lapsed for nonpayment without a final 30 day notice of impending lapse being sent.\nC. No, the man knew that the policy would not be renewed if did not get the payment into the insurer's possession by the due date of June 28.\nD. No, because the mail box rule is not applicable in a situation where an insurance policy must be renewed.\n"

This conclusion is based on the following reasoning:\n\nA. **Yes, because the renewal premium was placed in the mailbox before the date of expiration, and the notice did not say that the check had to be received physically before there could be a renewal.**\n\nThis option is the most compelling because it the notice did not specify that the check had to be received physically before there could be a renewal. The fact that the renewal premium was placed in the mailbox before the due date of June 28 and the policy was reinstated as of July 5 suggests that the insurer accepted the payment as valid, even though it was not physically received until later. This interpretation alignss with the principle that the insurer accepted the payment as valid, thereby maintaining the policy's effectiveness.\n\nB. **Yes, because a policy cannot be lapsed for nonpayment without a final 30 day notice of impending lapse being sent.**\n\nWhile this statement is true in general, it does not directly address the specific situation in this case. The notice did not specify a final 30 day notice of impending lapse, but it does not necessarily mean that the insurer could not accept the payment as valid.\n\nC. **No, the man knew that the policy would not be renewed if did not get the payment into the insurer's possession by the due date of June 28.**\n\nThis option is incorrect because it the man knew that the policy would not be renewed if he did not get the payment into the insurer's possession by the due date of June 28, it does not mean that the policy would be lapsed. The insurer accepted the payment as valid, even though it was not physically received until later.\n\nD. **No, because the mail box rule is not applicable in a situation where an insurance policy must be renewed.**\n\nThis option is incorrect because the mail box rule is generally applicable in situations where payment is made by mail. The insurer accepted the payment as valid, even though it was not physically received until later.\n\nTherefore, the courts are likely to hold that the policy was still effective on July 3, the date of the accident."
