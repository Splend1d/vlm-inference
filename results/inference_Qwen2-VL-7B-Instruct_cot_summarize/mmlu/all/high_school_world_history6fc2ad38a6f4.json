A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nZamindars had an ability \"to establish a claim to sovereignty\" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of\n\nA. religious toleration\nB. universal taxation\nC. martial law\nD. suffrage\n"

It focuses on the economic and political aspects of the Mogul Empire.\n\n2. **Universal Taxation**: The passage states that a zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was in a position of dependence. It suggests that if a zamindar wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse or omit to pay revenue. This implies that the Mogul Empire's policy of universal taxation was a factor in the zamindars' ability to establish claims to sovereignty.\n\n3. **Martial Law**: The passage does not mention martial law or any military policies. It focuses on the economic and political aspects of the Mogul Empire.\n\n4. **Suffrage**: The passage does not mention anything about suffrage or voting rights. It focuses on the economic and political aspects of the Mogul Empire.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. universal taxation**"
