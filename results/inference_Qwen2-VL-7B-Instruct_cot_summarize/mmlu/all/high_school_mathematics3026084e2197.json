This is because the decimal system is based on powers of 10, and 10 is made up of 2 and 5. Therefore, if a fraction is in simplest form and its denominator is a power of of 2 or a power of of 5, or a combination of both, then the fraction will be a terminating decimal.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9. This means we are looking for the smallest power of of 2 or a power of of 5, or a combination of both, that contains the digit 9.\n\nWe can start by listing the powers of 2 and 5:\n\n$2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 8$, $2^4 = 16$, $2^5 = 32$, $2^6 = 64$, $2^7 = 128$, $2^8 = 256$, $2^9 = 512$, $2^{10} = 1024$, $2^{11} = 2048$, $2^{12} = 4096$, $2^{13} = 8192$, $2^{14} = 16384$, $2^{15} = 32768$, $2^{16} = 65536$, $2^{17} = 131072$, $2^{18} = 262144$, $2^{19} = 524288$, $2^{20} = 1048576$, $2^{21} = 2097152$, $2^{22} = 4194304$, $2^{23} = 8388608$, $2^{24} = 16777216$, $2^{25} = 33554432$, $2^{26} = 67108864$, $2^{27} = 134217728$, $2^{28} = 268435456$, $2^{29} = 536870912$, $2^{30} = 1073741824$, $2^{31} = 2147483648$, $2^{32} = 4294967296$, $2^{33} = 8589934592$, $2^{34} = 17179869184$, $2^{35} = 34359738368$, $2^{36} = 68719476736$, $2^{37} = 137438953472$, $2^{38} = 274877906944$, $2^{39} = 549755813888$, $2^{40} = 1099511627776$, $2^{41} = 2199023255552$, $2^{42} = 4398046511104$, $2^{43} = 8796093022208$, $2^{44} = 17592186044416$, $2^{45} = 35184372088832$, $2^{46} = 70368744177664$, $2^{47} = 140737488355328$, $2^{48} = 281474976650656$, $2^{49} = 562943958991292$, $2^{50} = 112588785798"
