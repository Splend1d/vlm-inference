The passage by Pico della Mirandola emphasizes the uniqueness and dignity of man, suggesting that man is the most fortunate and worthy of admiration. It also also highlights the generosity of God and the happiness of man, implying that man is allowed to be whatever he chooses to be.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. That man was a unique kind of creature\n- The passage clearly states that man is the most fortunate and unique kind of creature, so this option is not correct.\n\nB. That God intended man to strive to achieve\n- The passage does not discuss or imply that God intended man to strive to achieve anything. It focuses on the inherent dignity and generosity of God towards man, not on specific goals or achievements.\n\nC. That man is unworthy of admiration\n- The passage explicitly states that man is worthy of all admiration, so this option is incorrect.\n\nD. That humans are God's equals\n- The passage does not discuss or imply that humans are God's equals. It focuses on the unique and fortunate nature of man, not on the concept of equality with God.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct inference from the passage is that Pico rejected the notion that humans are God's equals.\n\nFinal answer: D. that humans are God's equals"
