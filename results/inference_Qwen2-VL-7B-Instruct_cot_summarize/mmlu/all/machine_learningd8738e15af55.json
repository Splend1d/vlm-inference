                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\nStatement 1: \"The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its objective function.\"\n- This statement is generally true. Support Vector Machines ( (SVMs) are designed to find the globally optimal solution for the classification problem. The optimization problem in SVMs is convex, which means that any local minimum is also a global minimum. Therefore, the SVM algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution.\n\nStatement 2: \"After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space though we can\u2019t guarantee this.\"\n- This statement is also generally true. The Perceptron is a linear classifier that operates in its original input space. However, when data is not linearly separable in its original space, it can be transformed into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function ( such as the radial basis function ( (RBF) kernel. This transformation can make the data linearly separable in the higher-dimensional space, thereby improving the classification performance of the Perceptron. However, it is not guaranteed that the classification performance will always improve, as it depends on the specific data and the nature of the transformation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
