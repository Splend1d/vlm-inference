Therefore, there are 4 females and 4 males who can play the objects. We need to choose 3 out of these 8 members to play the objects. The number of ways to choose 3 objects out of 8 is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 objects out of 8 is:\n\\[C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways for each role together to get the total number of ways to assign the roles:\n\n\\[4 \\text{ ( (female lead)} \\times 4 \\text{ ( (male lead)} \\times 56 \\text{ ( (objects)} = 4 \\times 4 \\times 56 = 16 \\times 56 = 896\\]\n\nNone of the provided options match the calculated result of 896. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer is not listed among the options A, B, C, or D."
