The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?\n\nA. No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\nB. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\nC. Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.\nD. No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.\n"

Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\n\nIn this scenario, the restaurant can likely defend itself against the lawsuit by arguing that the customer voluntarily assumed the risk of consuming a fish sandwich that might contain a fish hook. This is based on the principle that customers are generally aware that fish can contain foreign objects, such as fish hooks, and that they are responsible for taking reasonable precautions while consuming such food."
