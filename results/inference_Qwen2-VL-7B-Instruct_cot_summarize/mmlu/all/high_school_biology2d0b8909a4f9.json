This suggests that the new variant is likely a form of polyploidy.\n\nPolyploidy occurs when an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes. This can lead to distinct phenotypes and reproductive isolation, as seen in the inability to breed with the original phenotype but the ability to breed among the new variants.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Polyploidy"
