The teenager, 18 years old and 6 feet 3 inches tall, said a very short man placed a knife against her throat and unzipped her dress as she was walking down the street. She pulled a gun from her purse and shot him. The man died of a chest wound. Police said the man, who was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 130 pounds, was an ex-felon, twice convicted of attempted rape. The teenager is charged with the murder of the man, as a result of the above described incident. At trial, the teenager wishes to offer evidence of the fact that the man was previously convicted of attempted rape. The evidence would be\n\nA. admissible, because it proves the man's disposition to commit rape.\nB. admissible, because the victim's prior convictions would be relevant on the issue of the defendant's self-defense.\nC. inadmissible, because the evidence is being used to prove propensity.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the Dead Man's Statute.\n"
