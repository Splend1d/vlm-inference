Let's analyze each option to determine which best captures this essence:\n\nA. **Justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.**\n   - This option suggests that justice and knowledge are interconnected and both require an admission of ignorance. While this may be true, it does not directly address Socrates' wisdom in recognizing his ignorance and the necessity of knowledge for just actions.\n\nB. **He knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.**\n   - This option suggests that Socrates knows what he is looking for, which is knowledge of the essences of things. This alignss well with the statement, as it emphasizes his recognition of his ignorance and the importance of knowledge for just actions.\n\nC. **Knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.**\n   - This option suggests that knowledge of essences is impossible because it requires knowing what we are looking for before we know what it is. This is a philosophical point about the nature of knowledge, but it does not directly address Socrates' wisdom in recognizing his ignorance and the necessity of knowledge for just action.\n\nD. **His method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.**\n   - This option suggests that Socrates' method of asking questions about essences is unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice. This does not align with the statement, as it suggests that his method is unjustified, which contradicts the idea of wisdom in recognizing ignorance.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best captures Socrates' wisdom in recognizing his ignorance and the necessity of knowledge for just action is:\n\n**B. He knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.**"
