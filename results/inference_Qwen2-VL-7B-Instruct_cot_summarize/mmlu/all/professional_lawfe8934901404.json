On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: \"Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more.\" On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\nC. Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\nD. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n"

The fact that the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note does not negate the acceptance of the offer. The offer was accepted when the collector sent the signed note on June 1, and the expert began the restoration work on June 4, which is considered acceptance of the offer. Therefore, the contract exists between the expert and the collector's estate."
