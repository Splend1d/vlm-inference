Therefore, the book value of the land is $20,000.\n\nThe gain on the exchange is calculated as follows:\n\nGain on exchange = Fair value of machinery received - Book value of land given up\n\nGain on exchange = $55,000 - $20,000\n\nGain on exchange = $35,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $35,000."
