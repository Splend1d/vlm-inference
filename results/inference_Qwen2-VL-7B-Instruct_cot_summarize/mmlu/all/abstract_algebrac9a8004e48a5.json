A ring homomorphism \\( f: R \\rightarrow S \\) is one-to-one (injective) if and only if the kernel of \\( f \\) is the set containing only the zero element of \\( R \\). This is because the kernel of a ring homomorphism is defined as the set of all elements in \\( R \\) that map to the zero element in \\( s \\). If the kernel is just the zero element, then every element in \\( R \\) maps to a unique element in \\( s \\), making \\( f \\) one-to-one.\n\nStatement 2 is False. The statement \"Q is an ideal in R\" is not necessarily true. An ideal \\( Q \\) in a ring \\( R \\) is a subset of \\( R \\) that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of \\( R \\). For \\( Q \\) to be an ideal in \\( R \\), it must satisfy these properties. Without additional information about \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\), we cannot conclude that \\( Q \\) is an ideal in \\( R \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
