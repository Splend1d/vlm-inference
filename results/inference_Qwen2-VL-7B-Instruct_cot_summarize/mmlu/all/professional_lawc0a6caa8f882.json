She didn't tell him that she was pregnant, and decided to get an abortion without telling him. Her state had a law requiring her to sign a statement verifying that she had told her husband of her intended abortion. She refused to sign and sued the state to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Is the law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the law did not intrude on the wife's right to privacy because the husband had an equal right to be protected.\nB. No, the law presented only a minimum intrusion and it would not be difficult for married women to obtain their husband's consent.\nC. Yes, it is unconstitutional because a woman has an unqualified right to an abortion on demand.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n"

Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n\nThe law in question appears to be an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion, as it requires her to sign a statement verifying that she had told her husband of her intended abortion. This requirement could potentially prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion if she chooses not to disclose the pregnancy to her husband, thereby imposing an undue burden on her right to choose abortion."
