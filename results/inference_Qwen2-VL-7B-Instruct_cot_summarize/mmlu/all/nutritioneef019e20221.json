The Summit's goal of cutting the number of hungry people in half by 2015 was achieved.\n- This option suggests that the goal was achieved, which is not accurate. The goal was to halve the number of hungry people by 2015, but it has not been achieved.\n\nB. The number decreased, but not by nearly enough to meet the Summit's goal.\n- This option suggests that there has been some decrease in the number of food insecure people, but not enough to meet the goal set by the Summit. This is a plausible scenario as the goal was ambitious and has not been fully met.\n\nC. The number increased slightly.\n- This option suggests an increase in the number of food insecure people, which is not consistent with the goal of reducing hunger.\n\nD. Because of rising food prices, the number increased dramatically.\n- This option suggests that the increase in the number of food insecure people is due to rising food prices. While rising food prices can contribute to increased food insecurity, it does not directly address the overall change since the 1996 Summit.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate option is:\n\nB. The number decreased, but not by nearly enough to meet the Summit's goal.\n\nFinal answer: B. The number decreased, but not by nearly enough to meet the Summit's goal."
