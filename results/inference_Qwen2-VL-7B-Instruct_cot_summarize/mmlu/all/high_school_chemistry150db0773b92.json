                    "text": "To determine the strength of binary acids based on bond strength and periodic relationships, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Bond Strength**: In binary acids, the strength of the acid is related to the strength of the bond between the hydrogen and the central atom ( (X-H bond). The stronger the bond, the stronger the acid.\n\n2. **Periodic Relationships**: The electroneegativity of the central atom ( X determines the strength of the bond. Elements with higher electroneegativity tend to form stronger bonds with hydrogen.\n\n3. **Electronegativity Values**:\n   - Oxygen ( (O) has an electronegativity of approximately 3.5.\n   - Selenium ( (Se) has an electronegativity of approximately 2.5.\n   - Sulfur ( (S) has an electroneegativity of approximately 2.5.\n\nGiven these values, the electroneegativity of oxygen is higher than that of selenium and sulfur. Therefore, the bond strength of H2O is stronger than that of H2Se and H2S.\n\n4. **Bond Strength Order**:\n   - H2O has the strongest bond due to the high electroneegativity of oxygen.\n   - H2Se has a weaker bond than H2O but stronger than H2S due to the electroneegativity of selenium.\n   - H2S has the weakest bond due to the lower electroneegativity of sulfur.\n\nThus, the correct order of bond strength from strongest to weakest is:\nH2O > H2Se > H2S\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. H2Se > H2S > H2O"
