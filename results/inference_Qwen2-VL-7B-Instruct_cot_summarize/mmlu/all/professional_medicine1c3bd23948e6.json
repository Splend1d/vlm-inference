She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\nC. Pelvic ultrasonography\nD. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast\n"

CT scan of the abdomen with contrast\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including low-grade fever, abdominal cramps exacerbated by bowel movements, and a history of intermittent constipation, suggest a possible gastrointestinal issue. The absence of nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools, along with the negative test for occult blood in the stool, makes it less likely that these symptoms are due to a gastrointestinal infection or bleeding. Instead, the patient's history of hypertension and previous hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy suggest that the symptoms could be related to the abdominal cavity, such as a possible infection or other abdominal pathology.\n\nA CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is the most appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate the abdominal cavity for any potential causes of the patient's symptoms. This imaging test can help identify any abnormalities in the abdominal organs, such as an abscess, diverticulitis, or other conditions that could be causing the patient's symptoms."
