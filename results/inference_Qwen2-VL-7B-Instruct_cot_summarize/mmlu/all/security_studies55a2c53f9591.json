To prevent the securitization of irrelevant threats and to challenge the legitimacy of currently securitized threats.\n\nDesecuritization is the process of removing a threat from the realm of security and placing it back into the realm of politics, society, and other non-security domains. This process is important because it helps to prevent the erosion of established civil liberties through the removal of special rights and the cessation of extraordinary measures. It also helps to prevent stagnation of the security realm and facilitate the recognition and securitization of new or more urgent existential threats. It also helps to ensure that securitize actors conceptualise security threats in terms of those that can be addressed using extraordinary measures."
