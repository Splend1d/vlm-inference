Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nOn which of these documents is Susan B.

                    "text": "To determine which document Susan B. Anthony based her appeal for women's equality on, we need to analyze the context and content of the question and the options provided.\n\nThe question refers to a passage from Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" which discusses the interconnectedness of all communities and the interdependence of justice. This passage emphasizes the idea that injustice in one place affects justice everywhere and that everyone is connected.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Articles of Confederation - This was the first constitution of the United States, which established the federal government. It does not directly relate to the issue of women's equality.\n\nB. Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction - This document was issued by President Andrew Johnson after the Civil War, granting amnesty to those who had supported the Confederacy and providing for the readmission of the Southern states to the Union. It does not directly relate to the issue of women's equality.\n\nC. Compromise of 1850 - This was a series of compromises that temporarily resolved the issue of slavery in the territories. It does not directly relate to the issue of women's equality.\n\nD. Declaration of Independence - This document, written by Thomas Jefferson, declared the independence of the United States from Great Britain and laid out the principles of equality and liberty. It is the most relevant document as it discusses the idea of equality and justice, which are central to Susan B. Anthony's appeal for women's equality.\n\nGiven the context and the content of the question, the most appropriate document for Susan B. Anthony's appeal for women's equality is:\n\nD. Declaration of Independence."
