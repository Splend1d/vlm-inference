Violation of the statute was a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail. After the statute's enactment, a defendant sold a pack of cigarettes to a girl who was 17 years of age. Before selling the product to the girl, the defendant carefully examined the girl's driver's license, which indicated that she was, in fact, 17 years old. The defendant nevertheless made the sale because he erroneously believed the age of majority to be 17. The defendant is subsequently charged with violation of the statute, and his mistake is honestly held to have been made. Such a mistake should\n\nA. not prevent his conviction, because mistake of the law is no defense.\nB. not prevent his conviction, because the crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\nC. result in his acquittal, because he took reasonable steps to ascertain the girl's age.\nD. result in his acquittal, because he did not possess the requisite mens rea.\n"

This means that a defendant cannot escape liability for a crime simply because they were unaware of the law. The defendant's honest mistake about the age of majority does not negate the fact that they violated the statute by selling tobacco to a minor."
