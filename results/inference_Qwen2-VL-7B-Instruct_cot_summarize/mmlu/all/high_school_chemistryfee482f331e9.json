The correct procedure is:\n\nA. Add 167 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution.\n\nThis procedure ensures that you start with the correct volume of the stock solution and then dilute it to the desired concentration by adding distilled water to the mark on the volumetric flask."
