He immediately sent a purchase order which stated \"our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF.\"\u009d Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated \"Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes.\" If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:\n\nA. A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.\nB. A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.\nC. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\nD. No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n"
