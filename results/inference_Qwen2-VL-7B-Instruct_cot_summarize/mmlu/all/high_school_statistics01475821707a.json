The number of heads in three tosses of a coin\n- This is a binomial model because there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails, each with a constant probability (1/2, and the trials are independent.\n\nB. The number of rainy days in a given week\n- This is not a binomial model because the probability of rain on any given day is not constant throughout the week.
