The Earth and Venus are in a 1:1 orbital resonance (for every 1 Earth orbit there is exactly 1 Venus orbit).\n- This statement is true. The Earth and Venus do indeed have a 1:1 orbital resonance, meaning they complete one orbit around the Sun for every orbit the other completes.\n\nB. Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 orbital resonance ( for every 3 Neptune orbits there are exactly 2 Pluto orbits).\n- This statement is true. Neptune and Pluto have a 3:2 orbital resonance, meaning for every 3 orbits Neptune completes, Pluto completes 2.\n\nC. The Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt are due to resonances with Jupiter.\n- This statement is true. The Kirkwood Gaps are caused by resonances with Jupiter, which perturb the orbits of asteroids in the asteroid belt.\n\nD. Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance.\n- This statement is not true. While Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 orbital resonance, this does not prevent them from colliding. In fact, their orbits are close enough that they could collide over time, despite the resonance.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is:\n\nD. Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance."
