The defendant has pleaded not guilty, claiming that he made an honest mistake as to the date the expenses were paid. At trial, the prosecutor offers evidence of the defendant's involvement in an earlier scheme to help a different client falsify tax returns in the same way. Is the evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is impermissible character evidence.\nB. No, because it is not relevant to the issues in this case.\nC. Yes, to show absence of mistake.\nD. Yes, to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.\n"

Yes, to show absence of mistake.\n\nThe evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme is admissible to show that the defendant did not make an honest mistake regarding the date the expenses were paid. This is because the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme demonstrates a pattern of behavior that suggests the defendant was aware of and engaged in fraudulent activities, which directly contradicts the defendant's claim of an honest mistake."
