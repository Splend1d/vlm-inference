There are a total of 10 integers to choose from, so there are 10 x 10 = 100 possible pairs of integers. \nNext, let's consider the pairs of integers that are squares of each other. There are 3 pairs of integers that are squares of each other: ( (1, 1), ( (4, 4), and ( (9, 9). \nTherefore, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is ( (100 - 3) / 100 = 0.97. \nSo, the answer is D. 0.95."
