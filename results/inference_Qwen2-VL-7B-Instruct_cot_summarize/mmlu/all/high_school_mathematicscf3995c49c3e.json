Continuity at a point does not guarantee the existence of the derivative at that point. For example, the function \\( f(x) = |x| \\) is continuous everywhere but not differentiable at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nB. If \\( f'(c) = 0 \\), then \\( f \\) has a local maximum or minimum at \\( c \\).\n- This statement is false. The derivative being zero at a point only indicates a critical point, but it does not necessarily mean it is a local maximum or minimum. It could be an inflection point or a point of horizontal tangent.\n\nC. If \\( f''(c) = 0 \\), then the graph of \\( f \\) has an inflection point at \\( c \\).\n- This statement is false. The second derivative being zero does not necessarily indicate an inflection point. An inflection point requires a change in the concavity of the function, which is determined by the sign change of the second derivative.\n\nD. If \\( f \\) is differentiable at \\( x = c \\), then \\( f \\) is continuous at \\( x = c \\).\n- This statement is true. If a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous at that point. Differentiability implies continuity.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is:\n\nD. If \\( f \\) is differentiable at \\( x = c \\), then \\( f \\) is continuous at \\( x = c \\)."
