This is because the Olmec civilization was contemporary with the Olmec civilization, and the Olmec civilization was not yet in existence when the Maya began their monumental construction. Therefore, the timing of monumental construction at Ceibal suggests that the Maya were developing their own architectural style and techniques independently of the Olmec. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
