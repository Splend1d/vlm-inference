This is because the selection process may have biased the sample in some way, so that the results of the experiment may not be representative of the broader population. For example, if the sample is selected from a particular group of people who are more likely to respond positively to a treatment, then the results of the experiment may not be generalizable to other groups of people who are not as likely to respond positively to the treatment."
