His neighbor wants to buy it so he can make his yard bigger and use the structure as a storage space, so he agrees to buy the bungalow in a written agreement. The sale is to be complete on October 14. On October 10, the neighbor realizes he cannot pay $10,000, and offers to pay $8,000 instead. The man agrees, and the exchange takes place on October 14. The man then sues for the remaining $2000. Would he likely prevail in getting the additional $2,000 that is part of the signed contract?\n\nA. No, the modification of the sales price was accepted and therefore both parties are bound to the $8000 price.\nB. Yes, there was a lack of additional consideration under the pre-existing duty rule so that the modification was invalid and the original price was still valid.\nC. No the original contract was a unilateral contract that could not be modified and had to be performed at the original price.\nD. No, there was full performance of the contract.\n"
