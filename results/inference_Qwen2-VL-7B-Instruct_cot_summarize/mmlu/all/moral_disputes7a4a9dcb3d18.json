She says the claim is very plausible.\nB. She says the claim is implausible.\nC. She says the claim is self-evident.\nD. She says the claim is true.\n\nHursthouse is known for her work in moral philosophy, particularly in the area of moral realism. She has discussed the nature of moral theories and the guidance they provide. Given her background and the nature of her work, it is reasonable to infer that she would likely critique the claim that any adequate moral theory must provide clear guidance that any intelligent person could follow.\n\nHursthouse is known for her nuanced views on moral theories and the challenges they face in providing clear and universally applicable guidance. She often argues that moral theories face a significant burden in providing such guidance, and that the complexity and diversity of moral situations often make it impossible for any theory to provide clear and universally applicable guidance.\n\nGiven this context, the most plausible answer is:\n\nB. She says the claim is implausible.\n\nHursthouse would likely argue that the claim is implausible because it is not feasible for any moral theory to provide clear and universally applicable guidance that any intelligent person could follow."
