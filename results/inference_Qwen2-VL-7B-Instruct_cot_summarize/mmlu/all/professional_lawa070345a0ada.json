The death was a result of head injuries, which is a foreseeable consequence of such an act. In contrast, murder typically requires a specific intent to kill or to cause serious bodily harm. Since the defendant did not intend to kill, the case is more likely to be manslaughter, which is a lesser offense that does not require the same level of intent as murder."
