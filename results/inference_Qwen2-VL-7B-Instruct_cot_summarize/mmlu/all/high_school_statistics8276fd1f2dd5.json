We can use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean ( (83 days)\n- \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation ( (sqrt(386) = 19.64 days)\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size ( (40)\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is approximately 1.96.\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \\pm 1.96 \\left( \\frac{19.64}{\\sqrt{40}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \\pm 1.96 \\left( \\frac{19.64}{6.32} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \\pm 1.96 \\times 3.10 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \\pm 6.09 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = (76.91, 89.09 \\]\n\nSo, the confidence interval is approximately (76.91 to 89.09 days.\n\nNow, we need to find the confidence level that corresponds to this interval. We can use the z-table or a calculator to find the z-score that corresponds to the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.\n\nFor the lower bound (76.91:\n\\[ z = \\frac{76.91 - 83}{19.64} \\approx -3.00 \\]\n\nFor the upper bound 89.09:\n\\[ z = \\frac{89.09 - 83}{19.64} \\approx 3.00 \\]\n\nThe z-score of 3.00 corresponds to a confidence level of approximately 99.9% ( (using a z-table or calculator).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 82.1%"
