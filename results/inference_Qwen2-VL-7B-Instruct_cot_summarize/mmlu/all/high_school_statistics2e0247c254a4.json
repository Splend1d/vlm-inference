The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents.

The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nC. The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nD.

The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n   - The mean price increases by 50 cents, but the range increases by $4.90 ( ($30.49 - $4.49), not just 50 cents. This option is incorrect.\n\nB. The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n   - The mean price increases by 50 cents, not remains the same. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.\n   - The mean price increases by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices remains the same because the spread of of the prices around the mean is not affected by a uniform increase. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.\n   - This option is correct because the standard deviation measures the spread of of the prices around the mean, and a uniform increase in all prices does not change the spread.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same."
