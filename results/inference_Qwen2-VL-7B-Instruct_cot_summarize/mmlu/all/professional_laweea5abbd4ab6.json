Two days after his funeral, the boy's mother saw a television program about gang violence and was shocked to see video of herself weeping over the boy's body. The video had been shot by the television reporting team while the boy's body was still lying on a public street. The mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of seeing the video. If the mother sues the television station for invasion of her privacy and that of her son, will the mother be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a person has no right to privacy after his or her death.\nB. No, because the street was open to the public and the subject was newsworthy.\nC. Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.\nD. Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video.\n"

Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.\n\nThe mother's claim for invasion of privacy is likely to be successful because she did not give permission for the video of her weeping over her son's body to be used in the television program. The fact that the street was open to the public and the subject was newsworthy does not negate the mother's right to privacy regarding the private moment of her grief. Additionally, the emotional distress she suffered as a result of seeing the video is a significant factor in determining the likelihood of her prevailing in the lawsuit."
