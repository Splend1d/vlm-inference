The proposed statute's preamble recites that its provisions will ensure: \u0080\u0094 responsible insurance coverage for all those who do business with the state;an increased standard of living for the citizens who comprise the state's labor force; \u0080\u0094 the lowest possible expenditures by the state government; and \u0080\u0094 a beautiful, uniform aesthetic decor for all new state buildings. If the state statute is attacked as violating the commerce clause, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The statute is a valid exercise of the state's police power to legislate to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of its citizens.\nB. The statute falls within the reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\nD. The statute is a valid exercise of state action only if the federal government has not previously \"occupied the field\" in this area.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\n\nThe commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce. The statute in question appears to have several provisions that could be challenged under the commerce clause. Specifically, the requirement that businesses must purchase insurance only from insurance companies chartered in the state, the preference given to citizens of the state in hiring unskilled laborers, and the prohibition on nonresident aliens engaging in state-related business activities could all be seen as discriminatory practices that unduly burden interstate commerce.\n\nHowever, if the state can demonstrate that there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests, the statute may be upheld. For example, the state could argue that requiring insurance from in-state companies ensures that the state has control over the insurance market and can regulate it to protect the state's citizens. Similarly, the state could argue that the preference for citizens of the state in hiring unskilled laborers is necessary to ensure that the state's labor force has a higher standard of living. Finally, the state could argue that the prohibition on nonresident aliens engaging in state-related business activities is necessary to ensure that the state's businesses are not unduly burdened by competition from out-of-state businesses.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is that the statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests."
