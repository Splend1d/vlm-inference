The total number of tennis balls is 56, and the number of buckets is 8. Therefore, the correct number sentence is:\n\nB. 8 \u00d7 t = 56\n\nThis equation represents the total number of tennis balls (56, being the product of the number of buckets (8 and the number of tennis balls in each bucket (t. To find t, we would divide both sides of the equation by 8, which gives us:\n\nt = 56 \u00f7 8\n\nThis matches the correct answer:\n\nB. 8 \u00d7 t = 56"
