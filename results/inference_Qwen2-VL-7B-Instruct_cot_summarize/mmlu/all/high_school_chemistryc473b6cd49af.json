The energy required for this separation is proportional to the attractive forces between the solvent molecules.\n\n2. **Step 2: Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent.**\n   - This step involves breaking the intermolecular bonds between solute molecules to allow them to fit into the spaces created by the solvent molecules. The energy required for this separation is also proportional to the attractive forces between the solute molecules.\n\n3. **Step 3: Separated solute and solvent are brought together filling in the spaces.**\n   - This step involves the mixing of the separated solute and solvent molecules to form a solution. The energy released when the solute and solvent molecules come together is proportional to their attractive forces.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Starting at equilibrium, moving particles apart while in the solid or equilibrium phases requires added energy proportional to the attractive force.**\n   - This is relevant because it explains the energy required to break intermolecular bonds, which is a part of steps 1 and 2.\n\nB. **Bringing particles together releases energy in proportion to their attractive force.**\n   - This is also relevant because it explains the energy released when solute and solvent molecules come together, which is a part of step 3.\n\nC. **The total of the energies in steps 1 to 3 indicates if a solution will form.**\n   - This is relevant because it indicates that the overall energy change (whether positive or negative) determines if a solution will form. If the total energy change is negative, the solution will form.\n\nD. **Molecules with similar molecular mass are required to form solutions.**\n   - This is not relevant because it does not directly relate to the energy changes involved in the formation of solutions. The molecular mass of the molecules does not affect the energy changes required for the formation of solutions.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental principle that is not important in understanding the formation of solutions is:\n\n**D. Molecules with similar molecular mass are required to form solutions.**"
