Pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex.\n- The prefrontal cortex is a critical brain region involved in executive functions such as decision-making, impulse control, and planning. Substance abuse can lead to pathological changes in this area, which can impair executive functioning.\n\n II. Increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations.\n- Substance abuse can indeed lead to hallucinations, but auditory hallucinations are more commonly associated with conditions like schizophrenia rather than just substance abuse. Therefore, while it is possible, it is not necessarily true for all cases of substance abuse.\n\n III. Reduced behavioral impulse control.\n- Substance abuse often leads to impaired impulse control, as the drug use can alter the brain's reward system, making it harder for the individual to resist the urge to use substances.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate statements are:\n\nI. Pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex.\nIII. Reduced behavioral impulse control.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and III only"
