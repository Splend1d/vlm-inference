If the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, what will the effect on the entropy of the helium be?\n\nA. It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.\nB. It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.\nC. It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.\nD. It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\n"

It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\n\nWhen the helium gas is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, the entropy of the helium will increase. This is because the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask, leading to a greater number of possible microstates of the system. According to the second of the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of a closed system will tend to increase over time."
