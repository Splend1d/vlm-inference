The possible structures are determined by the partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nFor the prime 2, the exponents are 3. The partitions of 3 are:\n1. \\(3\\)\n2. \\(2 + 1\\)\n3. \\(1 + 1 + 1\\)\n\nFor the prime 3, the exponents are 2. The partitions of 2 are:\n1. \\(2\\)\n2. \\(1 + 1\\)\n\nNow, we combine these partitions to form the possible structures of the Abelian group of order 72.\n\n1. \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\)\n2. \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^1\\)\n3. \\(2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 2^1\\)\n4. \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^2\\)\n5. \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^1 \\times 3^1\\)\n\nThese are the distinct structures of Abelian groups of order 72. Therefore, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is 5.\n\nNone of the options provided (A. 4, B. 6, C. 8, D. 9 match the correct answer.
