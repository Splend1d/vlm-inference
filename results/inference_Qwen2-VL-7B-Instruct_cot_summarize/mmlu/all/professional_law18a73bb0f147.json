The victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a person criminally liable for the murder of any person who dies as a result of the commission of or attempt to commit a felony. The key element here is that the death must occur during the commission of or attempt to commit the felony. If the victim died before the fire spread to the bedroom where the victim was sleeping, it would not meet the requirement that the death occurred during the commission of the felony ( (setting the fire). Therefore, this assertion would not likely remove liability for felony murder."
