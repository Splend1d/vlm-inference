This is because the MAC construction simply concatenates the key k and the message m to be hashed, and then hashes the result. This means that anyone who knows the key k can compute the MAC for any message m and any additional data w, simply by concatenating k and w to the message and hashing the result. This violates the security properties of a MAC, which require that only the holder of the key should be able to compute the MAC for a given message. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
