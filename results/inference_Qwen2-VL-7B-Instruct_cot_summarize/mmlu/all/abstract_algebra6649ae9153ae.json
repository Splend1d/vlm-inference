A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials of lower degree.\n\nLet's check each option for \\( c \\):\n\n1. **\\( c = 0 \\)**\n   - The polynomial becomes \\( x^3 + 0x^2 + 1 = x^3 + 1 \\).\n   - This can be factored as \\( (x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1) \\) where \\( e \\) is the multiplicative inverse of \\( -1 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), which is \\( 2 \\) since \\( -1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\cdot -1 = 1 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( x^3 + 1 \\) is not irreducible.\n\n2. **\\( c = 2 \\)**\n   - The polynomial becomes \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \\).\n   - This polynomial is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) because it has no roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). To check, we evaluate \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \\) for \\( x = 0, 1, 2 \\):\n     - \\( 0^3 + 2 \\cdot 0^2 + 1 = 1 \\)\n     - \\( 1^3 + 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 1 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\)\n     - \\( 2^3 + 2 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \\equiv 2 \\)\n   - Since there are no roots, the polynomial is irreducible.\n\n3. **\\( c = 1 \\)**\n   - The polynomial becomes \\( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \\).\n   - This polynomial is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) because it has no roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). To check, we evaluate \\( x^3 + y^2 + 1 \\) for \\( y = 0, 1, 2 \\):\n     - \\( 0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1 \\)\n     - \\( 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\)\n     - \\( 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 1 \\)\n   - Since there are no roots, the polynomial is irreducible.\n\n4. **\\( c = 3 \\)**\n   - The polynomial becomes \\( x^3 + 3x^2 + 1 \\).\n   - This this polynomial is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) because it has no roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). To check, we evaluate \\( x^3 + 3x^2 + 1 \\) for \\( x = 0, 1, 2 \\):\n     - \\( 0^3 + 3 \\cdot 0^2 + 1 = 1 \\)\n     - \\( 1^3 + 3 \\cdot 1^2 + 1 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\)\n     - \\( 2^3 + 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 12 + 1 = 21 \\equiv 0 \\)\n   - Since there are no roots, the polynomial is irreducible.\n\nTherefore, the values of \\( c \\) that make \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1\\) a field are \\( c = 2, 1, \\) and \\( 3 \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 2\nC. 1\nD. 3"
