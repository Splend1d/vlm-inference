And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nThe events described in the passage most likely occurred in which modern-day country?\n\nA.

The references to Cort\u00e9s, the division of gold, and the treatment of the Indian females are all indicative of events that took place during the Spanish conquest of Mexico. The mention of the city and the Indian females align with the historical context of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which took place in what is now Mexico."
