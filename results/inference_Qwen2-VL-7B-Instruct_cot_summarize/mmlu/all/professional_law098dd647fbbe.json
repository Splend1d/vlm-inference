At trial, the manufacturer has called as an expert witness a product safety engineer, who testifies that the manufacturer retained him for a fee to test identical mowers and, if his opinion was helpful, to testify in the case. The expert then testifies that he did test the mowers, and that the blade, as designed and installed by the manufacturer, could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff. Assume that the expert has used a reliable method for reaching his conclusion. Should the court admit the expert's testimony?\n\nA. No, because it goes to an ultimate issue that only the jury can decide.\nB. No, because the manufacturer paid the expert to render a certain opinion, in violation of rules barring paid testimony. violation of rules barring paid testimony.\nC. Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\nD.

Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\n\nExpert testimony is generally admissible in court to assist the trier of fact in understanding complex issues, such as the cause of an injury in this case. The fact that the expert was paid by the manufacturer does not necessarily disqualify the testimony, as long as the expert's methods are reliable and the testimony is relevant and helpful to the jury. The plaintiff's notice and opportunity to participate in the testing process are also important considerations, but they are not the primary reason for admitting the expert's testimony."
