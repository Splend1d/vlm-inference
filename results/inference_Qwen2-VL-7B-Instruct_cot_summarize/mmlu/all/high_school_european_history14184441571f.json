This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\n\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC. Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\nD. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n"

The excerpts focus more on theological and philosophical aspects rather than the relationship between the state and the religious organization.\n\n2. **Option B: Calvinist believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.**\n   - This the excerpts do not mention consubstantiation or transubstantiation. These are theological concepts related to the nature of the Eucharist, which are not discussed in the provided excerpts.\n\n3. **Option C: Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.**\n   - While this is a historical fact about the Reformation, the excerpts provided do not discuss the political use of the reformed faith. The focus is on theological and philosophical ideas.\n\n4. **Option D: Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinist chose to honor only two of them.**\n   - The excerpts mention Calvin's views on the seven sacraments, but they do not provide a direct comparison with Lutherans' views. Calvin did indeed reject some of the sacraments, but the excerpts do not provide enough information to compare this with Lutherans' views.\n\nGiven the information provided, none of the options directly address the biggest contrast between Calvinist and Lutheran ideas based on the excerpts. However, the closest option that could be inferred from the provided excerpts is:\n\n**Option D: Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinist chose to honor only two of them.**\n\nThis option is the most plausible based on the information provided, as it directly relates to the seven sacraments, which are mentioned in the excerpts.\n\nTherefore, the biggest contrast between Calvinist and Lutheran ideas, based on the provided excerpts, is:\n\n**D. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinist chose to honor only two of them.**"
