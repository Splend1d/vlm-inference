This covers both the condition to drive (age \u2265 16) and the condition to vote (age \u2264 18). Therefore, this expression evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, which contradicts the requirement.\n\n2. **Expression II: (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18))**\n   - This expression is true if the person's age is at least 16 but less than 18. This covers the condition to drive (age \u2265 16) and excludes the condition to vote (NOT(age \u2265 18)). Therefore, this expression evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, which matches the requirement.\n\n3. **Expression III: (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))**\n   - This expression is true if the person's age is less than 18 but greater than or equal to 16. This covers the condition to drive (age < 18) and excludes the condition to vote (NOT(age < 16)). Therefore, this expression evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, which matches the requirement.\n\nGiven the analysis, both expressions II and III evaluate to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. II and III only**"
