Inquiring about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data would help the auditor verify that the transactions have been completed and that the subsequent events have occurred as recorded. This is because subsequent events are events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Therefore, the auditor needs to verify that the transactions recorded on the basis of preliminary data have been completed and that the subsequent events have occurred as recorded."
