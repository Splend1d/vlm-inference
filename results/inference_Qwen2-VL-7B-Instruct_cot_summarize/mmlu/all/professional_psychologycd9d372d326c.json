People with interests highly similar to the occupation ( (Group A) are more likely to find the work fulfilling and enjoyable, which can lead to higher persistence rates.\n\nB. **Group A and Group B would not differ in success at or satisfaction with the occupation**\n   - This statement is less likely to be justified. While Group A might have a higher likelihood of persistence, their overall success and satisfaction could still vary based on other factors such as aptitude, skills, and personal motivation.\n\nC. **Group A members would be more likely to succeed in the occupation**\n   - This statement is plausible. Individuals with interests similar to the occupation ( (Group A) are more likely to be well-suited for the tasks and responsibilities, which can contribute to higher success rates.\n\nD. **Group B members would achieve levels of success equal to those of Group A, but would do so more slowly**\n   - This statement is plausible. Group B, with interests that are highly dissimilar to the occupation, might still achieve the same level of success as Group A, but it would likely take longer due to the mismatch between their interests and the demands of the occupation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most justified statement is:\n\n**C. Group A members would be more likely to succeed in the occupation.**\n\nThis is because individuals with interests similar to the occupation are more likely to be well-suited for the tasks and responsibilities, which can contribute to higher success rates."
