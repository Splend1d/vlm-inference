As part of his scheme, the boyfriend enlisted his girlfriend, who agreed to drive the getaway car. On the day of the robbery, the girlfriend and the boyfriend drove to the bank. After the girlfriend parked outside and the boyfriend went into the bank, she saw a security guard in the bank and changed her mind and fled on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the motor running. A few minutes later, the boyfriend went into the bank, robbed it, and then ran back to the car. He drove off and was speeding away from the bank when he looked behind to see if he was being followed. As he took his eye off the road, the boyfriend's vehicle struck a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. For the pedestrian's death, the girlfriend should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

Involuntary manslaughter**.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter is a crime that occurs when a person causes the death of another through the commission of a criminal act or through negligence, without any intent to kill. In this scenario, the girlfriend's actions of (fleeinging the scene and leaving the keys in the car with the motor running\u2014resulted in the boyfriend's speeding away and striking a pedestrian, leading to her death. This is an example of negligence, as her actions contributed to the situation that ultimately led to the pedestrian's death. Therefore, she should be held criminally responsible for involuntary manslaughter."
