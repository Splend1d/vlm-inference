                    "text": "A criminal defendant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to ten years in prison, starting on Jan. 1, 2000. Sec. 204 of the state penal code provided for early release for good behavior, and under that provision he would have been granted supervised release as of Jan. 1, 2007. On Feb. 1, 2006, the state legislature repealed Sec. 204 and passed Sec. 205a. It reduced the good time credits for anyone convicted from that date onward, and also for anyone in prison as of the date of the section's passage. The new release date was calculated to be Jan. 1, 2009. The criminal defendant brought a habeas corpus action arguing that Sec. 205a was an unenforceable ex post facto law as to him. The state courts turned him down saying that good time credit was a privilege and not a vested right. The case ultimately came before the U.S. Supreme Court. Did the Supreme Court invalidate Sec. 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law?\n\nA. No, because good time credits were an act of grace that could be taken away at any time.\nB. Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\nC. Yes, because the legislature does not have the authority to pass a law that decreases good time credits for prisoners.\nD. No, the criminal defendant did not have a vested right in the early release date.\n"

Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court would likely invalidate Sec. 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed. The ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the enactment of laws that retroactively increase the punishment for a crime. In this case, the new law reduced the good time credits for the defendant, who was already serving a sentence and was entitled to those credits under the old law. Therefore, the new law would be considered as an ex post facto law and would be unconstitutional."
