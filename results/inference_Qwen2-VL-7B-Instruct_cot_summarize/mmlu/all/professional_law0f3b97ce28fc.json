If the homeowner finds the completed job to be satisfactory, he will pay the house painter $10,000 within one week after the job is completed. \"Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the homeowner's contractual obligation to pay the house painter $10,000?\n\nA. Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.\nB. Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.\nC.

Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.\n\nThis is because the contract specifies that the homeowner will pay the house painter $10,000 \"if the homeowner finds the completed job to be satisfactory.\" This means that the homeowner's payment is contingent upon the house painter's completion of the work to the homeowner's satisfaction. Therefore, the homeowner's payment is an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance."
