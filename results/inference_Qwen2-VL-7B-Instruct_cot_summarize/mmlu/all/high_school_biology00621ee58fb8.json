Each species possesses a specialized adaptation for obtaining food. Why is it that similar adaptations do not exist among the finches of the South American mainland, the presumed origin of the Gal\u00e1pagos finch ancestor?\n\nA. The various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nB. South American predators limited evolution of the mainland finch.\nC. Reproductive isolation is not possible on the mainland.\nD. The available niches that the Darwin's finches exploited on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were already occupied by other species of birds on the mainland.\n"

The various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\n\nThis explanation is based on the principle of ecological niche, which refers to the specific role or position of an organism within its environment. The finches on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have evolved specialized adaptations to exploit the unique food sources available on the islands. Since the mainland has different food sources, the finches there have not evolved similar adaptations because they do not need to specialize in the same ways as their Gal\u00e1pagos counterparts."
