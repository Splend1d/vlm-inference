Images produced by concave lenses are always real.\n- This statement is incorrect. Concave lenses can produce both real and virtual images, depending on the object distance and the focal length of the lens.\n\nB. Images produced by concave mirrors are always real.\n- This statement is incorrect. Concave mirrors can produce both real and virtual images, depending on the object distance and the curvature of the mirror.\n\nC. Images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual.\n- This statement is correct. Convex lenses can produce both real and virtual images, depending on the object distance and the focal length of the lens.\n\nD. Images produced by convex mirrors can be both real and virtual.\n- This statement is incorrect. Convex mirrors always produce virtual images, as they do not form an image at a finite distance but rather extend infinitely.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. Images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual."
