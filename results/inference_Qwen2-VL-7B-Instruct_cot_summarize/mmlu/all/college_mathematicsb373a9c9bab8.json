                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and the concept of related rates. Let's denote the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall as \\(x\\) and the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground as \\(y\\). The length of the ladder, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the ladder, the wall, and the ground, is constant at 9 meters. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 9^2\\]\n\nWe are given that the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, which means \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) meters per second. We need to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\), the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time \\(t\\), we get:\n\n\\[2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nWe are asked to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) when \\(y = 3\\) meters. First, we need to find the value of \\(x\\) when \\(y = 3\\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[x^2 + 3^2 = 9^2\\]\n\n\\[x^2 + 9 = 81\\]\n\n\\[x^2 = 72\\]\n\n\\[x = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(x = 6\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(y = 3\\), and \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) into the differentiated equation:\n\n\\[2(6\\sqrt{2})(2) + 2(3)\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\n\\[24\\sqrt{2} + 6\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\):\n\n\\[6\\frac{dy}{dt} = -24\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -4\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the top end of the ladder is sliding downward. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 4*sqrt(2)"
