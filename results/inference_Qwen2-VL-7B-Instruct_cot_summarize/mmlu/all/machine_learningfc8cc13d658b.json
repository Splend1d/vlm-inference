They are piecewise linear functions that are zero for negative inputs and linear for positive inputs. This means they do not increase monotonically for all inputs.\n- Sigmoids, on the other hand, are monotonic. They are S-shaped functions that increase monotonically from negative to positive infinity.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: \"Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.\"\n\n- This statement is generally false. While gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm used in training neural networks, it does not guarantee convergence to the global optimum. It can often get stuck in local optima, especially in high-dimensional spaces. The probability of converging to the global optimum depends on various factors, including the architecture of the neural network, the choice of learning rate, and the specific problem being solved.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is False.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
