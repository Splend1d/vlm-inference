Since \\( a \\) is a string of length 1, \\( a \\) can be considered as \\( e \\) in this context. Therefore, \\( a^M = a \\) is true.\n\n### Option B: \\( (ax)^M = xa)^M \\)\n- This option suggests that \\( (aw)^M = aw^Ma \\) is true for any \\( w \\). However, the recursive definition does not support this. The correct recursive definition is \\( (aw)^M = aw^Ma \\), not \\( xa)^M \\). Therefore, this option is false.\n\n### Option C: \\( (xy)^M = y^Mx^M \\)\n- This option suggests that \\( (xy)^M = y^Mx^M \\). However, the recursive definition does not support this. The correct recursive definition is \\( (aw)^M = aw^Ma \\), not \\( y^Mx^M \\). Therefore, this option is false.\n\n### Option D: None of the above\n- Since we have found that Option A is true and Options B and C are false, Option D is not correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\n**A. a^M = a**"
