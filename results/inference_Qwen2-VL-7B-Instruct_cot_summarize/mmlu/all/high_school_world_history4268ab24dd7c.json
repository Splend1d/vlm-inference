                    "text": "To determine which practice Peter the Great continued when he ruled Russia, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage. The passage states that Peter the Great was determined to change Russia and believed that he, as the ruler, must provide both the direction and the motive force for the transformation. He was convinced that education and persuasion were not enough, and if necessary, he could use force to drive the nation forward.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that Peter the Great continued to practice a form of authoritarian rule, where he maintained centralized power and control over the country. This alignss with the practice of serfdom, which was a form of forced labor and a system of social stratification that was prevalent in Russia during Peter the Great's reign.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Decentralization of power - This is not consistent with the passage, which describes Peter the Great as determined to maintain centralized power.\n\nB. Isolationism - The passage does not mention anything about Peter the Great's foreign policy or isolationism.\n\nC. Serfdom - This is consistent with the passage, as Peter the Great was known for maintaining a system of serfdom, which was a form of forced labor and social stratification.\n\nD. Reform - While Peter the Great did attempt reforms, the passage emphasizes his determination to maintain centralized power and control, rather than sharing power with the people.\n\nTherefore, the practice that Peter the Great continued when he ruled Russia is:\n\nC. Serfdom"
