An assignment of future rights from future contracts.\n\nAn assignment of future rights from future contracts is not an exception to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned. This is because the assignment of of future rights from future contracts is a valid assignment as long as it is done in accordance with the law and the terms of the contract.\n\nOn the other hand, the other options listed are all considered exceptions to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned:\n\nA. An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk.\nB. An assignment not allowed by law.\nD. An assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk.\n\nThese exceptions are based on the principle that an assignment should not impose additional burdens or risks on the obligor without their consent."
