The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory.\n   - This statement is true. Virtual memory systems allow programs to have a virtual address space that is larger than the physical memory available. This is achieved through techniques like page swapping, where pages are moved between physical memory and secondary storage ( like a hard drive.\n\n II. Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution.\n   - This statement is false. Programs can be swapped out to secondary storage when they are not needed, and swapped back in when they are needed again. This is a key feature of virtual memory systems.\n\n III. Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program.\n   - This statement is false. Pages are typically used to map physical memory to virtual memory, and do not necessarily correspond to semantic characteristics of the program. They are more about organizing memory for efficient use.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only"
