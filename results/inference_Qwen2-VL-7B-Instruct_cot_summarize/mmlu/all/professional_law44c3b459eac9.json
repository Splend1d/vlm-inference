They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a \"no\" or \"yes\" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said \"yes.\" This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent. He was arrested for murder and moved to suppress the confession. Will the court suppress the confession as being involuntarily given?\n\nA. No, the circumstances indicate that he understood that he could stop the questioning and get a lawyer but he did not do so.\nB. No, whenever a written list of Miranda warnings is given to a suspect and he doesn't ask for a lawyer, this is proof that the suspect fully understands his rights.\nC. Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.\nD. Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to suppress the confession as being involuntarily given. This conclusion is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Miranda Rights and Voluntariness**: The Miranda rights are designed to protect individuals from self-incrimination by ensuring they understand their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning. The suspect's refusal to sign the written waiver of these rights indicates that he did not voluntarily agree to the interrogation.\n\n2. **Involuntary Admission**: The fact that the suspect was questioned for three hours and did not ask for a lawyer during this period suggests that he was not in a position to make an informed decision about his rights. The prolonged questioning without a request for legal representation could imply that the suspect was coerced or unduced into making statements.\n\n3. **Religious Deception**: The use of religious pressure to elicit a confession is a significant factor. The detective's question about asking God for forgiveness for killing the child is likely to have had a profound emotional impact on the suspect, potentially leading to a confession that was not freely given.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to suppress the confession as it was not voluntarily given. The suspect's emotional response to the religious question, combined with the prolonged questioning without a request for legal assistance, suggests that the confession was not the product of a free and informed decision.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary."
