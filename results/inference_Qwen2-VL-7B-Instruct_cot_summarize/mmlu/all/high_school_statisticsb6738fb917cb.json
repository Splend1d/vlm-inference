The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\n\nWhen the sample size is increased from 200 to 2,000, the distribution of the sample proportion will become more normal and less spread out. This is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means ( (or in this case, the sample proportions) will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. Additionally, the standard error of of the sample proportion will decrease, leading to a narrower distribution."
