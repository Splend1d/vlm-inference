One year later, the employer had the employee sign a covenant not to compete for a two-year period after termination. Two years later, the employee quit and went to work for a competitor company. The prior employer sued, asking for a preliminary injunction to enforce the covenant. The employee argued that the covenant was invalid because no consideration passed to her \u0080\u0093 she could be fired at any time and did not receive anything for signing. The employer argued that it provided her with continued employment when it did not have to do so. Does the employer have a legal right to enforce the covenant?\n\nA. Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration.\nB. Yes, because modification of an existing contract does not require consideration.\nC. Yes, because the courts never question the adequacy of consideration in an agreement.\nD. No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.\n"

No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.\n\nIn the context of employment contracts, a covenant not to compete typically requires consideration to be valid. Consideration is a term in contract law that refers to something of value exchanged between the parties. In this case, the employee argues that there was no consideration because she could be fired at any time and did not receive anything for signing the covenant. The employer's provision of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is not considered as adequate consideration because it is not a new promise or benefit that the employee did not already have as part of the original employment contract.\n\nTherefore, the courts would likely find that the covenant not to compete is invalid due to the lack of adequate consideration."
