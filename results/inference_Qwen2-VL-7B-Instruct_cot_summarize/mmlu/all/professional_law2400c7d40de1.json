A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?\n\nA. Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\nC. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n"

The plaintiff ( in this case, the president of the union\u2014must prove that the senator made the statements with \"actual malice,\" meaning with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard for whether they were false or not. This standard is designed to protect public figures from false statements that are made without substantial evidence of their truthfulness."
