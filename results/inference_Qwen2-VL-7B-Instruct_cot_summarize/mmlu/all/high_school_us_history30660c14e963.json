There they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization. . . .\n\"This emigration would be voluntary, for it would be as cruel and unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. . . .\"\n\u2014President Andrew Jackson, 1829\nBased on this quotation, what can you infer about the efforts of Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement of the 1950s?\n\nA. The civil rights movement was not finding success through nonviolent methods.\nB. Advocates for civil rights were coordinating their efforts to raise awareness of racial segregation across the country.\nC. King was focused on ending segregation in Birmingham only.\nD. King was willing to compromise his principles and would be a violent agitator if necessary.\n"

The quotation suggests that the government was considering setting aside land for Native Americans to live in peace and be taught the arts of civilization, which implies that the government was willing to make changes to accommodate the needs of different groups of people. This suggests that the civil rights movement was not focused on ending segregation in one specific location, but rather on ending segregation across the country. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
