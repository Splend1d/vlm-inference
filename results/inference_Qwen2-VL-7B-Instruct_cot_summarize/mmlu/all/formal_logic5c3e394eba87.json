(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nOption A is incorrect because it has F \u2283 ~E instead of ~E \u2283 F.\nOption B is incorrect because it has C \u2283 ~S instead of C \u2261 ~S.\nOption C is incorrect because it has ~(F \u2283 E) instead of ~E \u2283 F.\nOption D is incorrect because it has F \u2283 E instead of ~E \u2283 F.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\nB.
