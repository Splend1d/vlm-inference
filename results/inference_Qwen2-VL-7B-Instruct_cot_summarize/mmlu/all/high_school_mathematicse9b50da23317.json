                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the operation $\\#$**:\n   - The operation $\\#$ is defined such that $r\\ \\#\\ 0 = r$ and $r\\ \\#\\ s = s\\ \\#\\ r$. This implies that the operation is symmetric with respect to $r$ and $s$.\n   - The third condition is $(r + 1)\\ \\#\\ s = (r\\ \\#\\ s) + s + 1$. This suggests a pattern or a rule that we can use to find the value of $11\\ \\#\\ 5$.\n\n2. **Applying the third condition**:\n   - Let's use the third condition to find a pattern. We know that $11\\ \\#\\ 5$ can be rewritten using the third condition by considering $r = 11$ and $s = 5$.\n   - According to the third condition, $(r + 1)\\ \\#\\ s = (r\\ \\#\\ s) + s + 1$. Substituting $r = 11$ and $s = 5$, we get $(11 + 1)\\ \\#\\ 5 = (11\\ \\#\\ 5) + 5 + 1$.\n   - Simplifying, we have $12\\ \\#\\ 5 = (11\\ \\#\\ 5) + 6$.\n\n3. **Using the first condition**:\n   - From the first condition, we know that $11\\ \\#\\ 5 = 11$ ( because $r\\ \\#\\ 5 = 5\\ \\#\\ r$ and $5\\ \\#\\ 5 = 5$.\n\n4. **Substituting back into the equation**:\n   - Now, substituting $11\\ \\#\\ 5 = 11$ into our equation from step 2, we get $12\\ \\#\\ 5 = 11 + 6$.\n   - This simplifies to $12\\ \\#\\ 5 = 17$.\n\n5. **Final step**:\n   - However, we need to find $11\\ \\#\\ 5$, not $12\\ \\#\\ 5$. We made a mistake in our interpretation. Let's correct this by directly applying the third condition correctly.\n\nCorrecting Approach:\n- We should directly apply the third condition to find $11\\ \\#\\ 5$ without substituting $11\\ \\#\\ 5 = 11$ into our equation. Let's correct this:\n\nGiven $(r + 1)\\ \\#\\ s = (r\\ \\#\\ s) + s + 1$, we substitute $r = 11$ and $s = 5$:\n- $(11 + 1)\\ \\#\\ 5 = (11\\ \\#\\ 5) + 5 + 1$.\n- Simplifying, we get $12\\ \\#\\ 5 = 11\\ \\#\\ 5 + 6$.\n\nSince we know from the first condition that $11\\ \\#\\ 5 = 11$, we substitute this into our equation:\n- $12\\ \\#\\ 5 = 11 + 6$.\n- This simplifies to $12\\ \\#\\ 5 = 17$.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct approach to find $11\\ \\#\\ 5$ directly.
