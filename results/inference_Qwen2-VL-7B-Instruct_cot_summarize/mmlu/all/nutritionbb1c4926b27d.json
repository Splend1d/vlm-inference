During puberty seems to be associated with higher bone mineral density in later life.\n\nThis statement is supported by research that indicates that milk consumption during puberty can lead to higher bone mineral density, which may translate to better bone health and potentially lower fracture risk later in life. However, it's important to note that the relationship between milk consumption and bone health is complex and can vary depending on many factors, including individual differences, other dietary and lifestyle factors, and the specific type and amount of milk consumed."
