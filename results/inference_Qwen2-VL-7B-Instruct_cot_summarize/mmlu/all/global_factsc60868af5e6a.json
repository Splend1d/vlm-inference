Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate this:\n\n1. **GDP per capita in 1950**:\n   - Let's assume the GDP per capita in 1950 was $100 ( (this is a hypothetical value for illustration purposes).\n\n2. **GDP per capita in 2016**:\n   - Let's assume the GDP per capita in 2016 was $8,000 ( (this is a hypothetical value for illustration purposes).\n\n3. **Inflation Adjustment**:\n   - To adjust for inflation, we need to know the average annual inflation rate from 1950 to 2016.\n   - Let's assume the average annual inflation rate was 3%.\n   - The formula to adjust for inflation is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = \\text{Nominal GDP per capita} \\times ( (1 + \\text{Inflation Rate})^{\\text{Number of Years}}\n     \\]\n   - Number of years from 1950 to 2016 is 66 years.\n   - \\[\n     \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = 8,000 \\times ( (1 + 0.03)^{66}\n     \\]\n   - \\[\n     \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = 8,000 \\times 2.3747\n     \\]\n   - \\[\n     \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} = 18,997.6\n     \\]\n\n4. **PPP Adjustment**:\n   - To adjust for PPP, we need to know the PPP index for China in 1950 and 2016.\n   - Let's assume the PPP index in 1950 was 1 and in 2016 was 2.5.\n   - The formula to adjust for PPP is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{PPP-adjusted GDP per capita} = \\text{Adjusted GDP per capita} \\times \\text{PPP Index}\n     \\]\n   - \\[\n     \\text{PPP-adjusted GDP per capita} = 18,997.6 \\times 2.5\n     \\]\n   - \\[\n     \\text{PPP-adjusted GDP per capita} = 47,494\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Hypothetical Values**:\n   - If we compare the hypothetical values:\n     - Nominal GDP per capita in 1950: $100\n     - Nominal GDP per capita in 2016: $8,000\n     - The increase in nominal GDP per capita is:\n       \\[\n       \\frac{8,000}{100} = 80 \\text{ fold}\n       \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, considering both inflation and PPP adjustments, is approximately 80 fold.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. by 8 fold"
