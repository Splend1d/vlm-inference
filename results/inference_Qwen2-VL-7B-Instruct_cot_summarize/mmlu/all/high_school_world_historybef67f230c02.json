This. This. The treaty was. was. to. settle. a. controversy. between. the. two. monarchs. regarding. the. lands. discovered. in. the. Americas. and. beyond. It. established. a. clear. boundary. for. each. country. to. claim. and. explore. the. newly. discovered. territories.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery.\n- This. The. treaty. clearly. shows. that. the. monarchs. ( King. of. Portugal. and. King. of. Castile. were. directly. involved. in. the. discovery. and. exploration. of. the. New. World. and. beyond. This. the. treaty. was. a. direct. result. of. their. interest. in. these. activities.\n\nB. Joint-stock companies sponsored colonization efforts in the western and eastern hemispheres.\n- The treaty does not mention joint-stock companies or any specific sponsorship of colonization efforts. It focuses on the division of discovered lands between Portugal and Spain.\n\nC. Trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n- The treaty does not address trade in guns and slaves. It is focused on the division of newly discovered lands.\n\nD. The Scientific Revolution and the discovery of heliocentricity.\n- The treaty is not related to the Scientific Revolution or the discovery of heliocentricity. It is a political and territorial agreement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the Treaty of Tordesillas, 1494, provides evidence for option A: Monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery.\n\nFinal answer: A. Monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery."
