The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\n\nWhen a nonconductinging sphere with a net electric charge, +Q, is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius, the conducting sphere will experience an electrostatic attraction due to the presence of the charged nonconductinging sphere. This is because the electric field lines from the charged nonconductinging sphere will induce a charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere, resulting in a net negative charge on the side facing the nonconductinging sphere and a net positive charge on the opposite side. This induced charge distribution will create an electrostatic force between the two spheres, which will be attractive in nature."
