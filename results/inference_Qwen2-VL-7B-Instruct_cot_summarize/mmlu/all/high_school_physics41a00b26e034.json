Therefore, the horizontal acceleration (ax is 0.\n\n2. **Vertical Acceleration (ay**:\n   - The vertical acceleration ay is due to the component of the gravitational force acting along the incline. The component of the gravitational force along the incline is given by \\(mg\\sin(\\theta)\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the car, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the incline.\n   - The acceleration due to this component is \\(a = g\\sin(\\theta)\\).\n   - Since \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) is always less than or equal to 1, the vertical acceleration ay is always less than or equal to \\(g\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. ax = 0; ay = g."
