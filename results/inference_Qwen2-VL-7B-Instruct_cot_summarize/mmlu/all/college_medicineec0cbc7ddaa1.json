Ammonia is not produced in repeated high intensity exercise. Instead, lactate and other metabolic byproducts accumulate during exercise.\n\nB. Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5 seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place.\n- This statement is false. Lactate accumulation begins almost immediately during exercise, not after 5 seconds.\n\nC. Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise.\n- This statement is true. Phosphocreatine depletion begins almost immediately during high intensity exercise.\n\nD. With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.\n- This statement is false. The rate of lactate accumulation in muscle increases with repeated sprints, not decreases.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\nD. With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines."
