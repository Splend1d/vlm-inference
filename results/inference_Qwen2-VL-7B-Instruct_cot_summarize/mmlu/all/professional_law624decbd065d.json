The agent asked the addict to obtain heroin for him, but the addict refused. For several weeks the agent continued to plead with and beg the addict to get him drugs; finally, the addict gave in to the pressure and got the drugs. The police promptly arrested him. At trial, the defendant raised the defense of government entrapment. Will the trial court likely dismiss the case based on that argument?\n\nA. Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\nB. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.\nC. No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.\nD. Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.\n"

For entrapment to be successful, the defendant must show that the government's actions were so improper that they overcame the defendant's moral sense and induced the defendant to commit the crime.\n\nIn this case, the defendant voluntarily entered a residential treatment center and was approached by a government agent who asked him to obtain heroin. The defendant initially refused but eventually gave in to the pressure and obtained the drugs. The defendant's predisposition to use drugs does not negate the entrapment defense. The key issue is whether the government's actions were so improper that they overcame the defendant's moral sense.\n\nThe court would likely consider the following factors:\n1. The nature and extent of the government's involvement in the defendant's decision to obtain the drugs.\n2. Whether the government's actions were so improper that they overcame the defendant's moral sense.\n3. Whether the defendant's decision to obtain the drugs was a result of the government's actions or his own free will.\n\nGiven that the defendant voluntarily entered the treatment center and was approached by a government agent, the court would likely find that the government's actions were improper and that the defendant's moral sense was overcome. Therefore, the court is unlikely to dismiss the case based on the defense of government entrapment.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user."
