This is because a free abelian group is generated by a basis, and any element of the group can be written as a linear combination of the basis elements with integer coefficients. Since the coefficients are integers, there are no elements of finite order ( (i.e., no torsion elements).\n\nStatement 2 is True. Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group. This is a consequence of the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups. If a group is torsion-free, it cannot contain elements of finite order, and thus it must be a free abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
