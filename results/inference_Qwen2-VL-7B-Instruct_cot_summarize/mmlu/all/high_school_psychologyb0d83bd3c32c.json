These theories are most applicable to situations where the behavior is directly related to reducing a physiological need or discomfort. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. In the middle of his five-mile race, Jerome grabs water from the water station to quench his thirst.\n- This behavior is directly related to reducing the physiological need for water, which fits the drive-reduction theory.\n\nB. Ernest gobbles a few cookies on his way to class because he did not have time for lunch.\n- This behavior is motivated by the need to satisfy hunger, which is a physiological need, fitting the drive-reduction theory.\n\nC. Tish decides to skip lunch because she is still full from eating a very large breakfast.\n- This behavior is motivated by the need to reduce the discomfort of being full, which fits the drive-reduction theory.\n\nD. Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway.\n- This behavior is not motivated by reducing a physiological need but rather by a desire for something else ( (the cheesecake). It does not fit the drive-reduction theory.\n\nTherefore, the option that would not provide a reasonable explanation according to drive-reduction theories is:\n\nD. Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway."
