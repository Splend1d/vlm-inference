Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n\nIn the context of a federal diversity action, a potential juror's relationship to the company involved in the case can be seen as a potential source of bias. The fact that the potential juror was an employee of the company and still owns shares of its stock raises concerns about impartiality. The judge should exercise caution in allowing a juror who might have a financial stake in the outcome of the case to serve on the jury. Therefore, the judge should strike the potential juror for cause to ensure the fairness and impartiality of the jury."
