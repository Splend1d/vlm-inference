This represents the percentage of candy bars that contain more than 225 calories.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the area to the left of \\( z = 1.5 \\) is approximately 0.9332. Therefore, the area to the right ( which is what we're interested in, is:\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.0668 \\times 100 = 6.68\\% \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 6.68%"
