However, without specific historical data, we can make an educated guess based on general trends and industry growth.\n\nHistorically, the consulting industry has experienced significant growth over the past few decades. Many factors have contributed to this growth, including globalization, increased outsourcing, and the rise of technology and data analytics.\n\nGiven the general trends in the consulting industry, it is reasonable to assume that the number of practitioners working in consultancies in the UK has likely grown significantly since 25 years ago. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC.
