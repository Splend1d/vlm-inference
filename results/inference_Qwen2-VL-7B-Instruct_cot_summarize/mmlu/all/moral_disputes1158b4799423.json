It suggests that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure and minimizes pain.\n\nB. **Perfectionist consequentialism** - This theory is not primarily concerned with the balance of pleasure and pain. Instead, it focuses on achieving a state of perfection or excellence, which is often seen as a higher moral goal than maximizing pleasure.\n\nC. **Rule consequentialism** - This theory is a form of consequentialism that evaluates actions based on the adherence to rules rather than the balance of pleasure and pain. It is more about following rules that are considered morally right, rather than the outcomes of actions.\n\nD. **By definition, consequentialist theories do not mention pain.** - This statement is incorrect. Consequentialist theories do indeed consider pain and pleasure as important factors in determining the rightness of an action.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. hedonistic utilitarianism"
