Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls.\n\nOsteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is typically based on bone mineral density ( (BMD) measurements, which are compared to age-matched controls. A BMD lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls is considered indicative of osteoporosis."
