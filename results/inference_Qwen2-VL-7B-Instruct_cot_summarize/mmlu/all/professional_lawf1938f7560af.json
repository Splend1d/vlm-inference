He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\n\nThe officer's actions were likely considered a valid search incident to the arrest of of the driver. This means that the search of the vehicle was reasonable and did not violate the driver's Fourth Amendment rights. The officer had probable cause to arrest the driver for driving under suspension and was justified in conducting a search of the vehicle to ensure the safety of the officer and others."
