Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as \"partners\" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is\n\nA. only Bob Wilson is liable.\nB. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\nC. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\nD. only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n"

Although Ted Lamar was not involved in the business, he was still the lender and had a legal claim against the loan. Pete Smith, who sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware, was unaware of the true situation and assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the business. As a result, Pete Smith is entitled to collect the debt from Bob Wilson, who is the borrower and the owner of the hardware store. Ted Lamar is only liable to the extent that the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson, as he is not involved in the business and has no direct responsibility for the debts incurred by the store."
