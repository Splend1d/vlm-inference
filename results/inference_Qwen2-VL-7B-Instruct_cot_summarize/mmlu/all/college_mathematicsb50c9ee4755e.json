The distance \\(D\\) from any point \\((x, y)\\) on the curve to the origin \\((0, 0)\\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y = \\frac{8}{x}\\) into the distance formula:\n\n\\[D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left(\\frac{8}{x}\\right)^2}\\]\n\n\\[D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{64}{x^2}}\\]\n\nTo minimize \\(D\\), we can minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \\(x^2 + \\frac{64}{x^2}\\). Let's find the derivative of this expression with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}( \\left(x^2 + \\frac{64}{x^2}\\right) = 2x - \\frac{128}{x^3}\\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\[2x - \\frac{128}{x^3} = 0\\]\n\n\\[2x^4 - 128 = 0\\]\n\n\\[x^4 = 64\\]\n\n\\[x = \\sqrt[4]{64}\\]\n\n\\[x = 2\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding \\(y\\) value:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{8}{x} = \\frac{8}{2\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSo, the point on the curve closest to the origin is \\((2\\sqrt{2}, 2\\sqrt{2})\\). The distance from this point to the origin is:\n\n\\[D = \\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{2})^2 + (2\\sqrt{2})^2}\\]\n\n\\[D = \\sqrt{8 + 8}\\]\n\n\\[D = \\sqrt{16}\\]\n\n\\[D = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the curve \\(xy = 8\\) to the origin is 4, which corresponds to option A."
