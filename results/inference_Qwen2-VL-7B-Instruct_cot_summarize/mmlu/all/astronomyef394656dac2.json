                    "text": "To determine the mass and weight of the sand bag on a planet with half the gravity compared to Earth, we need to understand the relationship between mass, weight, and gravity.\n\n1. **Mass**: Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and is independent of gravity. Therefore, the mass of the sand bag remains the same regardless of the planet's gravity. So, the mass of the sand bag is still 5 kg.\n\n2. **Weight**: Weight is the force exerteded by gravity on an object. It is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight} = \\text{mass} \\times \\text{gravity}\n   \\]\n\n   On Earth, the weight of the sand bag is given as 50 N. If the planet has half the gravity compared to Earth, the gravity on that planet would be half of Earth's gravity.\n\n   Let's denote the gravity on Earth as \\( g \\). Therefore, the gravity on the planet is \\( \\frac{g}{2} \\).\n\n   The weight of the sand bag on the planet would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight on planet} = \\text{mass} \\times \\frac{g}{2} = 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\times \\frac{g}{2} = \\frac{5g}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Since the weight on Earth is 50 N, we can write:\n   \\[\n   50 \\, \\text{N} = 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\times g\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{50 \\, \\text{N}}{5 \\, \\text{kg}} = 10 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the weight on the planet would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight on planet} = \\frac{5 \\times 10}{2} = 25 \\, \\text{N}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the mass of the sand bag is 5 kg, and its weight on the planet with half the gravity compared to Earth is 25 N.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Mass 5kg weight 25N"
