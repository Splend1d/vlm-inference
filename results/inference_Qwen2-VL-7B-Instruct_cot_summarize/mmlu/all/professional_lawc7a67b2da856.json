Tomato growers in a second state wish to ship tomatoes for sale into the first state but its tomatoes are in compliance only with the federal standards. The tomato growers' association in the second state brought an injunctive action in federal court against the agricultural department of the first state to enjoin enforcement of the genetic engineering rule on the basis of federal preemption. According to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, how will the courts decide the preemption claim?\n\nA. There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\nB. The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\nC. When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.\nD. The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\n"

                    "text": "The courts will likely decide the preemption claim by considering whether the first state's law interferes with or conflicts with the federal law. According to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, federal law generally preempts state law when the two laws are in conflict or when the state law frustrulates the purposes of the federal law.\n\nIn this case, the first state's law forbids the transportation or sale of tomatoes with a more than 10% \"genetic engineering factor,\" while the federal standards do not mention genetic engineering factors. The tomato growers' association argues that the first state's law interferes with the federal standards and that the federal law preempts the state law.\n\nGiven this scenario, the courts are likely to decide that the first state's law is preempted because it sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the federal standards. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted."
