This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. Therefore, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is always even. Hence, statement I is true.\n\n ii. **|E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1**\n\nThis statement is known as the Handshaking Lemma's corollary, which states that in any undirected graph, the number of edges is at least one less than the number of vertices. This is because a connected graph must have at least one edge connecting each pair of vertices, and the minimum number of edges required to connect \\( |V| \\) vertices is \\( |V| - 1 \\) ( (forming a tree). Therefore, statement II is true.\n\n iii. **G has at least one vertex with degree 1.**\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. For example, a complete graph ( \\( K_n \\) ( with \\( n \\) vertices has every vertex with degree \\( n - 1 \\), and there is no vertex with degree 1. Therefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and II"
