                    "text": "To determine which of the given options is not a group, we need to recall the definition of a group. A group must satisfy the following four properties:\n\n1. **Closure**: For all elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in the group, the result of the operation \\( a \\circ b \\) is also also in the group.\n2. **Associativity**: For all elements \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in the group, the equation \\( (a \\circ (b \\circ c) = ( (a \\circ b) \\circ c \\) holds.\n3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element \\( e \\) in the group such that for every element \\( a \\) in the group, the equations \\( e \\circ a = a \\circ e = a \\) hold.\n4. **Inverse Element**: For each element \\( a \\) in the group, there exists an element \\( b \\) in the group such that \\( a \\circ b = b \\circ a = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n### A. The integers under addition\n- **Closure**: The sum of any two integers is an integer.\n- **Associativity**: Addition is associative.\n- **Identity Element**: The identity element is \\( 0 \\).\n- **Inverse Element**: Every integer \\( a \\) has an inverse \\( -a \\) such that \\( a + (-a) = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the integers under addition form a group.\n\n### B. The nonzero integers under multiplication\n- **Closure**: The product of any two nonzero integers is a nonzero integer.\n- **Associativity**: Multiplication is associative.\n- **Identity Element**: The identity element is \\( 1 \\).\n- **Inverse Element**: Every nonzero integer \\( a \\) has an inverse \\( 1/a \\) such that \\( a \\times (1/a = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the nonzero integers under multiplication form a group.\n\n### C. The nonzero real numbers under multiplication\n- **Closure**: The product of any two nonzero real numbers is a nonzero real number.\n- **Associativity**: Multiplication is associative.\n- **Identity Element**: The identity element is \\( 1 \\).\n- **Inverse Element**: Every nonzero real number \\( a \\) has an inverse \\( 1/a \\) such that \\( a \\times 1/a = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the nonzero real numbers under multiplication form a group.\n\n### D. The complex numbers under addition\n- **Closure**: The sum of any two complex numbers is a complex number.\n- **Associativity**: Addition is associative.\n- **Identity Element**: The identity element is \\( 0 \\).\n- **Inverse Element**: Every complex number \\( a + bi \\) has an inverse \\( (a - bi \\) such that \\( (a + bi + (a - bi = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the complex numbers under addition form a group.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll the given options ( A, B, C, and D \u2014 satisfy the properties of a group. Therefore, none of them is not a group.\n\nHowever, if the question is asking for the option that is not a group, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question as all the given options are indeed groups. If the question intended to identify a non-group, it would need clarification."
