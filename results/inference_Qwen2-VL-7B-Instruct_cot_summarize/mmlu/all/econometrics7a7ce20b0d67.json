Some variables may be excluded at the first stage leading to coefficient biases\n\nThis is because the general to specific approach starts with a broad model and then systematically excludes variables based on statistical significance. If a variable is excluded at an early stage, it may lead to biased estimates of the coefficients of the remaining variables."
