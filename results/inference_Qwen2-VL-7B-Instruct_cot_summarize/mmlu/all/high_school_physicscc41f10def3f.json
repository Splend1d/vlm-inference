The forward force of the horse on the cart is greater than the backward force of the cart on the horse, providing a forward acceleration.\n\nWhen the horse applies a force to the cart, it is the net force acting on the cart that determines its acceleration. The force exerteded by the horse on the cart is the driving force, and the force exerteded by the cart on the horse is the reaction force. According to Newton's third law, these two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Therefore, the net force acting on the cart is the difference between these two forces, which is the force exerteded by the horse on the cart. If this force is greater than the friction force acting on the cart, the cart will accelerate forward."
