Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\n\nThe government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry because it leads to higher prices and lower consumer surplus. When firms collude, they tend to set prices higher than what would be set in a competitive market, reducing consumer surplus. This is because consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay, and higher prices reduce this difference. Therefore, the government aims to prevent collusion to ensure that prices remain competitive and consumer surplus is maximized."
