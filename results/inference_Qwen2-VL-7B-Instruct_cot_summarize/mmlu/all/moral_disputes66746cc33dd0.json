                    "text": "To solve this logic reasoning problem, we need to carefully analyze the context and the core of the question. The context involves Ashford's argument about effective altruism and the recognition of backup duties to aid agencies. The question asks us to determine what Ashford argues we can do by acknowledging these backup duties.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. Acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism.\n- This option suggests that by acknowledging backup duties, we can address the criticism that effective altruism is merely a temporary solution. This alignss with the idea of diffusing the criticism by showing that there are additional ways to help.\n\nB. Acknowledge that effective altruism fails to be the right response to global poverty.\n- This option suggests that by acknowledging backup duties, we are admitting that effective altruism is not the right approach. However, the argument seems to be more about diffusing criticism rather than outright admitting failure.\n\nC. Feel relieved about our duties to the global poor, since backup duties are not morally urgent.\n- This option suggests that by acknowledging backup duties, we feel relieved because these duties are not as morally urgent. This does not align with the argument, which seems to be about diffusing criticism rather than reducing moral urgency.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This option suggests that none of the above options accurately represent Ashford's argument. Given the analysis, this seems to be the most fitting conclusion.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most accurate representation of Ashford's argument is:\n\nA. Acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nA. Acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism."
