Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power.

                    "text": "To determine which ideology most inspired the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph, we need to carefully analyze the context and the core message of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the struggle against neo-colonialism and emphasizes the importance of preventing the financial power of developed countries from being used to impoverish less developed countries. It also mentions that non-alignment involves foreign investment from capitalist countries but that this investment must be in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned state with its own interests in mind. The focus is on the control and power dynamics rather than the nature of the economic system itself.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Fascism - Fascism is an ideology characterized by a strong emphasis on state control and often involves authoritarianism and a cult of personality. While it may involve state control, it does not align with the emphasis on non-alignment and cooperation with all states.\n\nB. Social Darwinism - Social Darwinism is based on the idea that societies and individuals should compete and evolve through natural selection, with the fittest surviving. This ideology does not align with the cooperative and non-aligned approach described by Nkrumah.\n\nC. Classical liberalism - Classical liberalism emphasizes individual freedom, minimal government intervention, and free markets. While it may involve some aspects of cooperation, it does not align with the non-aligned and state-controlled approach described by Nkrumah.\n\nD. Socialism - Socialism is an ideology that advocates for the ownership of the means of production by the collective or the state. It aligns with the idea of state control and planning, which is emphasized in the passage.\n\nGiven the emphasis on state control and planning, the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph is most inspired by:\n\nD.
