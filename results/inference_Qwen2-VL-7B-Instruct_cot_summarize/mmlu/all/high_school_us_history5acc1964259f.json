Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following factors did Alexander Hamilton believe was a source for the problems in the excerpt from Federalist #15?\n\nA. economic class divisions among the American people that prevented them from forging a unified vision.\nB. a failure of American policy-makers to abandon mercantilist principles and to embrace a laissez-faire approach to trade.\nC. a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\nD. an unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which factor Alexander Hamilton believed was a source for the problems described in the excerpt from Federalist #15, we need to carefully analyze the context and the content of the excerpt.\n\nThe excerpt describes a situation where the people, particularly whites, view blacks as property and do not consider them as having any rights. They cheat, kill, debauch, and take property from blacks without remorse. The reason given is that whites consider blacks to be their property by natural right.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Economic class divisions among the American people that prevented them from forging a unified vision.\n- This option suggests that the problems arise from divisions within the economic classes. However, the excerpt does not mention any economic class divisions or the lack of a unified vision.\n\nB. A failure of American policy-makers to abandon mercantilist principles and to embrace a laissez-faire approach to trade.\n- This option suggests that the problems is related to economic policies. The excerpt does not discuss economic policies or trade, so this option is not relevant.\n\nC. A weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n- This option suggests that the problem is due to a weak central government. The excerpt does not mention a weak central government or its inability to address pressing issues.\n\nD. An unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n- This option suggests that the problem is due to an unhealthy obsession with religion and individual salvation. The excerpt mentions that whites consider blacks as property by natural right, which is a moral and philosophical issue rather than a religious one. However, the obsession with religion and individual salvation could be indirectly related to the lack of concern for practical issues.\n\nGiven the context of the excerpt, the most relevant factor is the belief that whites consider blacks as property by natural right. This this belief is a moral and philosophical issue, it it is not directly related to economic policies, a weak central government, or an unhealthy obsession with religion and individual salvation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nD. An unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems."
