The man was attracted to the defendant and immediately engaged her in conversation. After having a few drinks together, the man invited the defendant back to his room for a nightcap. Sensing that the man was wealthy, the defendant agreed to accompany him back to his hotel room. When they got back to the room, the man excused himself to go to the bathroom. While he was inside the bathroom, the defendant took some narcotics from her purse and placed them in the man's drink. The defendant realized that the narcotics were a strong sedative and hoped that they would cause the man to pass out. She then planned to steal his wallet and jewelry. Upon returning from the bathroom, the man proceeded to finish his drink. Shortly thereafter, the man passed out. While he was unconscious, the defendant took his watch off his wrist and pulled the wallet out of his pants. She took $300 in cash from the wallet. As she was leaving, the defendant noticed that the man had a diamond earring in his left ear. She then ripped out the earring from his ear and stole that, as well. The man suffered a cut in his earlobe when the defendant snatched the earring. Which of the following crimes should the defendant be convicted of?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Robbery.\nC. Larceny and robbery.\nD. Battery and larceny.\n"

Larceny and robbery**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Larceny**: The defendant took the man's watch and wallet, which are both examples of theft. Larceny is the unlawful taking of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it.\n\n2. **Robbery**: The defendant used force or fear to take the man's diamond earring. Robbery involves the use of force or fear to obtain property from another person.\n\nThe defendant did not use force or fear to take the watch and wallet, so those actions would be considered larceny. However, the act of taking the diamond earring involved force or fear, making it robbery.\n\nTherefore, the defendant should be convicted of both larceny and robbery."
