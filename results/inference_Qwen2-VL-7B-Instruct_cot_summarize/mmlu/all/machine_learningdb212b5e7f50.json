L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regularization) tends to shrink the coefficients of the model but does not set them to zero. Therefore, it does not make the model more sparse. In contrast, L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regularization) can set some coefficients to zero, making the model more sparse.\n\nStatement 2: \"Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers.\"\n- This statement is true. Residual connections are a key component of ResNets (Residual Networks), which are a type of deep neural network architecture. Additionally, Transformers, which are widely used in natural language processing tasks, also also incorporate residual connections in their architecture.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
