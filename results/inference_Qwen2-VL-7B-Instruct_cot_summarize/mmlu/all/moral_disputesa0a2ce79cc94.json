It is often related to tangible, measurable outcomes.\n\nB. **Expressive harm**: This refers to harm that arises from the expression of certain ideas or opinions, often related to speech or other forms of communication.\n\nC. **Both causal and expressive harm**: This option suggests considering both types of harm, which could be a comprehensive approach.\n\nD. **Auxiliary harm**: This term is not commonly used in discussions about speech codes and harm. It might refer to harm that is not directly caused by speech but is a consequence of it.\n\nGiven the context and the typical focus in discussions about speech codes and harm, Altman is likely referring to the types of harm that are most directly relevant to the speech codes themselves. Speech codes are typically designed to prevent or mitigate harm caused by speech, such as expressive harm ( which is related to the content and expression of ideas.\n\nTherefore, the best prospects for success in justifications of speech codes would be:\n\n**B. expressive harm**"
