This means that the order in which projects options are ranked based on their NPV will remain the same regardless of the discount rate used. This is because NPV is a measure of the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows, and this difference is not affected by the discount rate.\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return ( (IRR) is a measure of the profitability of an investment, and it is not invariant to changes in the market rate. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV of an investment equal to zero. Therefore, the IRR will change if the discount rate changes.\n\nThe IRR can change the ranking of the projects. For example, if two projects options have different IRRs, the project with the higher IRR may be ranked higher than the project with the lower IRR. However, if the two project options have the same IRR, the ranking of the projects options will be the same regardless of the IRR.\n\nWe should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison. This is because the NPV and the IRR are both measures of the profitability of an investment, and they can be used to compare the profitability of different investment options. However, it is important to note that the NPV and the IRR are not always equivalent, and they may give different rankings for the same set of cash flows. Therefore, it is important to use both metrics to have a coherent comparison."
