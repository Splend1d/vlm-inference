I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nThe \"First Great Awakening\" can be seen as a direct response to which of the following?\n\nA.

Williams argues that Christ did not accept temporal power and thus should not be involved in matters of religion and civil affairs.\n\nThe \"First Great Awakening\" was a religious revival movement that occurred in the 18th century in the British colonies of North America. It was characterized by a renewed emphasis on personal religious experience and a call for a return to the fundamentals of Christianity. This movement was a direct response to the perceived corruption and formalism within the established churches, particularly the Puritan churches.\n\nGiven this context, the \"First Great Awakening\" was a direct response to Puritanism, which was the dominant religious and social movement in the colonies at the time. The Puritans were known for their strict adherence to religious doctrine and their influence on the colonial governments, which often led to conflicts between religious and civil authorities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Puritanism"
