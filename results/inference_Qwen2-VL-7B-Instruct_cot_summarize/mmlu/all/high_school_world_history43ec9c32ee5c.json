Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nAccording to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\n\nA. Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries\nB. Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra\nC. Competition from Russian hunters and trappers\nD. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals\n"

                    "text": "To determine which factor contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the second passage.\n\nThe passage states:\n- \"Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash.\"\n- \"At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River.\"\n- \"Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collector.\"\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the primary issue is the depletion of furbearing animals, which has led to a significant reduction in the resources available for tribute payments. The passage mentions that the abundance of sables and foxes has diminished, making it difficult for the natives to fulfill their obligations.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\nA. Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries - The passage does not mention any interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries.\nB. Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra - While this might be a factor, the passage does not specifically mention the inexperience of the natives.\nC. Competition from Russian hunters and trappers - The passage does not mention competition from Russian hunters and trappers.\nD. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals - This is the most significant factor mentioned in the passage, as it directly affects the availability of resources for tribute payments.\n\nTherefore, the factor that contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations is:\n\nD. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals"
