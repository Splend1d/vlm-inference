So, to find the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of of the sequence is divided by 4, we need to find the remainder when $100 \\div 12$ is divided by 4. This is 4. So, the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of of the sequence is divided by 4 is the same as the remainder when the 4th term of of the sequence is divided by 4. The 4th term of the sequence is 3. So, the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of of the sequence is divided by 4 is 3. The answer is: B. 3"
