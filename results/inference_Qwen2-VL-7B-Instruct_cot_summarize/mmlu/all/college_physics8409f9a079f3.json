In the absence of friction, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the mass is given by:\n\nKE = (1/2 * m^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.\n\nThe potential energy of the spring is given by:\n\nPE = 1/2 * k * x^2\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the mass is 0.30 kg, the velocity is 0.040 m/s, and the displacement is 0.030 m. We can use these values to calculate the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the system.\n\nKE = 1/2 * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2 = 0.00024 J\n\nPE = 1/2 * k * (0.030 m)^2\n\nWe can use the conservation of energy to find the spring constant:\n\nKE + PE = 0.00024 J + 0.00024 J = 0.00048 J\n\n0.00048 J = 1/2 * k * (0.030 m)^2\n\nk = 0.00048 J / (0.030 m)^2 = 0.00048 N/m\n\nNow we can calculate the potential energy of the spring:\n\nPE = 1/2 * 0.00048 N/m * (0.030 m)^2 = 0.0000072 J\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy:\n\nE = KE + PE = 0.00024 J + 0.0000072 J = 0.0002472 J\n\nConverting to microjoules:\n\nE = 0.0002472 J * 10^6 \u03bcJ/J = 247.2 \u03bcJ\n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is 247.2 \u03bcJ, which is closest to option A."
