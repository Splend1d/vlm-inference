If the strontium isotope ratios in the teeth of the Cop\u00e1n rulers differ significantly from those of the local population, it suggests that these individuals were not born locally but migrated from other regions. This would support the idea that the Cop\u00e1n rulers were foreigners from different parts of the Maya territory."
