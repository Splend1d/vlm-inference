It typically resolves on its own as the child grows and the bones become stronger. Therefore, no treatment is needed at this time. However, it is important to monitor the child's progress and ensure that she is developing normally. If the bowlegs persist or worsen, or if there are other concerns, a healthcare provider may recommend further evaluation or treatment."
