The language was insulting and harsh, but there were no attempts to make physical contact. Inside, patients were nervous and surgical procedures were intensified under the constant sounds of taunting taking place outside. The state court issued an injunction making the protesters stand 36 feet from the entrance, which put them on the other side of the street, but within clear sight of the clinic. The restriction reasonably cleared a space for ingress and egress. Since the streets are normally considered a \"public forum\" for free speech, will the appellate courts uphold the restriction?\n\nA. Yes, because their language was insulting, the restriction would be upheld as a fair restriction of speech.\nB. Yes, the injunctive restriction was a content-neutral restriction that burdened no more speech than was necessary.\nC. No, the right to protest according to one's religious beliefs about abortion cannot be regulated under the First Amendment.\nD. No, the regulation of free speech cannot be carried out by injunctive relief.\n"

The restriction was designed to clear a space for ingress and egress, and it was not based on the content of the speech. The fact that the language was insulting and harsh does not affect the constitutionality of the restriction as long as it is content-neutral."
