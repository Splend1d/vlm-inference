                    "text": "Let's analyze the situation step by step to determine which object reaches the bottom of the ramp first.\n\n1. **Sphere Rolling Down the Inclined Plane:**\n   - The sphere rolls down the inclined plane without slipping. This means that the sphere experiences both translational and rotational motion.\n   - The sphere gains mechanical energy due to the torque exerted on it. This torque is provided by the component of of the gravitational force acting parallel to the incline plane.\n   - The sphere's's rotational kinetic energy increases as it rolls down the incline plane.\n\n2. **Block Sliding Down the Plane:**\n   - The block slides down the plane without friction. This means that the block only experiences translational motion.\n   - The block does not gain rotational kinetic energy because there is no torque acting on it.\n\n3. **Comparison of Kinetic Energy:**\n   - The sphere gains both translational and rotational kinetic energy as it rolls down the incline plane.\n   - The block gains only translational kinetic energy as it slides down the plane.\n\n4. **Comparison of Time to Reach the Bottom:**\n   - The sphere gains more kinetic energy ( (both translational and rotational) than the block ( which gains only translational kinetic energy.\n   - Since the sphere gains more kinetic energy, it will have more total kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline plane.\n   - Therefore, the sphere will reach the bottom of the incline plane faster than the block.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. The sphere, because it gains rotational kinetic energy, but the block does not**"
