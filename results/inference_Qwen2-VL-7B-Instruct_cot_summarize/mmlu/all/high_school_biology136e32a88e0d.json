In fact, they discovered that humans have only about 24,000 genes. How can we exhibit so many different traits from so few genes?\n\nA. Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function of genes.\nB. Epigenetics enables one gene to produce many different traits.\nC. This is proof that pseudogenes and introns are expressed.\nD. A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing\n"
