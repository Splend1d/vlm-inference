E \u2283 ~F\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n3. ~G\n\nLet's break down the logical implications step by step:\n\n1. From premise 1 (E \u2283 ~F), we know that if E is true, then ~F must be true.\n2. From premise 2 (~F \u2283 G), we know that if ~F is true, then G must be true.\n3. From premise 3 (~G), we know that G is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. E \u2283 F\n- From premise 1 (E \u2283 ~F), we know that if E is true, then ~F must be true. However, this does not directly imply that F must be true. Therefore, this is not a one-step consequence.\n\nB. F \u2283 G\n- From premise 2 (~F \u2283 G), we know that if ~F is true, then G must be true. However, we already know from premise 3 that ~G is true, which contradicts this implication. Therefore, this is not a one-step consequence.\n\nC. G \u2283 E\n- This option is not directly related to the given premises. The premises do not provide any information about the relationship between G and E. Therefore, this is not a one-step consequence.\n\nD. ~~F\n- From premise 1 (E \u2283 ~F), we know that if E is true, then ~F must be true. Since ~F is true, then F must be false. Therefore, ~~F ( which means F is true, is not a one-step consequence.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we can conclude that none of the given options are immediate (one-step) consequences of the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the options ( A, B, C, or D are immediate consequences of the given premises."
