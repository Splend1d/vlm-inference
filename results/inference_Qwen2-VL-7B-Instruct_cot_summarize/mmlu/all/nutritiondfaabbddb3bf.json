The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization.\n\nThis statement is correct because adaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adjust its metabolic processes in response to changes in nutrient intake. When studying nitrogen balance, which measures the balance between nitrogen intake and nitrogen loss, the adaptive metabolic demand can lead to underestimation of the efficiency of protein utilization because the body may adjust its metabolic processes to conserve or utilize protein more efficiently than initially measured."
