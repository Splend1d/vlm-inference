Women can achieve equality through political pressure.\n\nMacKinnon's argument centers on the idea that the issue of women's equality is fundamentally about power dynamics and the dominance of men over women. She suggests that the question of equality is ultimately about power, not about the possibility of achieving it through political means. Therefore, the proposition that women can achieve equality through political pressure contradicts her argument by implying that power dynamics can be overcome through political action, which she does not support as the primary solution."
