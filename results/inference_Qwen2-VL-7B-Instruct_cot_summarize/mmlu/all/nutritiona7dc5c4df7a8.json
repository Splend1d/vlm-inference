Because some metabolic pathways are altered in sick people, which changes their micronutrient requirements.\nD. Because an acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.\n"

Because an acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.\n\nIn people with infections or inflammatory states, an acute phase reaction can occur, which is a systemic response to infection or injury. This reaction can lead to changes in the distribution of certain micronutrients, such as iron, zinc, and vitamin A, between tissues. These changes can affect the levels of these micronutrients in plasma or serum, leading to misleading results when assessing micronutrient status."
