Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.\nB. Realism regards identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behaviour.\nC. Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.\nD. Social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system, whilst realists regard state interaction as being the natural progression of identity formulation.\n"

Realism focuses on the state as the primary actor in the international system and emphasizes the concept of power and the balance of power. It. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behavior, and it regards the state of actor behavior in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern. In contrast, social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritizing the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. Social constructivism emphasizes the role of intersubjective meanings and the construction of identities through social interactions."
