Aquinas believed that some propositions are so evident that they do not require proof or demonstration. These are known as self-evident propositions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Every whole is greater than its part.\"\n- This is a self-evident proposition because it is intuitively clear that a whole is greater than any of its parts.\n\nB. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\"\n- This is a religious or spiritual statement and not a proposition that can be considered self-evident in the philosophical sense. It is not a proposition that can be proven or demonstrated through reason alone.\n\nC. \"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another.\"\n- This is a self-evident proposition because it is intuitively clear that if two things are equal to the same thing, they must be equal to each other.\n\nD. \"Man is a rational being.\"\n- This is a self-evident proposition because it is intuitively clear that humans possess rational abilities.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not an example of a self-evident proposition according to Aquinas is:\n\nB. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\"\n\nFinal answer: B. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\""
