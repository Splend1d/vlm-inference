The statement suggests that whenever someone is required to act in a certain way toward an animal for the sake of the animal, the explanation for this fact involves:\n\n1. Facts about the animal itself.\n2. The wider effects on human beings.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. The animal.\n- This option suggests that the explanation is solely based on facts about the animal. While it might be true that the animal's needs or characteristics play a role, it does not fully capture the broader context.\n\nB. The wider effects on human beings.\n- This option suggests that the explanation is based on the broader impact on human beings. While human actions are influenced by the welfare of of animals, this alone does not fully encompass the animal's needs.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n- This option suggests that the explanation involves both the animal and the wider effects on human beings. This seems to be the most comprehensive answer, as it acknowledges both the animal's needs and the broader human impact.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n- This option suggests that the explanation is neither based on the animal nor on the wider effects on human beings. This seems unlikely as both factors are typically considered in such contexts.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\nC. Both A and B"
