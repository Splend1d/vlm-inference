They have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions.\n\nWhen two non-zero vectors are added together and the resultant vector is zero, it means that the vectors are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This is because the addition of two vectors with equal magnitudes but opposite directions will cancel each other out, resulting in a net vector of zero length."
