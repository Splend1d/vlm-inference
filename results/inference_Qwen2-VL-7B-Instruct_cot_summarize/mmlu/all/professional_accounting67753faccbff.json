The multiplier effect is the increase in total income resulting from an initial increase in spending. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - MPC} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- MPC is the marginal propensity to consume.\n\nGiven:\n- The full-employment GDP is $1.3 trillion.\n- The actual GDP is $1.2 trillion.\n- The marginal propensity to consume (MPC is 0.8.\n\nFirst, calculate the multiplier:\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\]\n\nThe difference between the full-employment GDP and the actual GDP is the amount that needs to be increased in government expenditures to achieve full employment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Full-employment GDP} - \\text{Actual GDP} = 1.3 trillion - 1.2 trillion = 0.1 trillion \\]\n\nNow, calculate the necessary increase in government expenditures using the multiplier:\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in government expenditures} = \\text{Multiplier} \\times \\text{Difference} = 5 \\times 0.1 trillion = 0.5 trillion \\]\n\nConverting trillion to billion:\n\n\\[ 0.5 trillion = 500 billion \\]\n\nTherefore, the necessary increase in government expenditures to produce full employment is $500 billion.\n\nThe correct answer is not listed among the options provided. However, the closest option to $500 billion is:\n\nA. $100 billion"
