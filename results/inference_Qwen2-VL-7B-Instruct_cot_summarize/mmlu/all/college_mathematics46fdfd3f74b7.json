If a, b \u2208 F and a \u2264 b, then a + c \u2264 b + c for all c \u2208 F.\n2. If a, b \u2208 F and a \u2264 b and 0 > 0, then a \u00d7 c \u2264 b \u00d7 c for all c \u2208 F > 0.\n\n### Analysis of Each Statement\n\n#### A. It is possible to place an linear order relation \u2264 on the complex numbers C such that (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) is not an ordered field.\n- This statement suggests that it is possible to define an order relation \u2264 on the complex numbers C that does not satisfy the properties of an order field. This is indeed possible. For example, consider the order relation defined by:\n  \\[\n  a + bi \\le c + di \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad a \\le c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b \\le d.\n  \\]\n  This order relation does not satisfy the second property (2) because it is not true that if \\( a \\le c \\) and \\( b \\ge d \\), then \\( a \\times c \\le b \\times d \\).\n\n#### B. it is possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers C which make (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) an order field.\n- This statement suggests that it is possible to define an order relation \u2264 on the complex numbers C that does satisfy the properties of an order field. This is also indeed possible. For example, consider the order relation defined by:\n  \\[\n  a + bi \\le c + di \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad a \\le c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b \\le d.\n  \\]\n  This order relation does satisfy the properties of an order field because it satisfies both properties 1 and 2.\n\n#### C. Neither (a) nor (b)\n- This statement suggests that neither statement A nor statement B is true. This is not necessarily true because statement B is indeed true.\n\n#### D. Both (a) and ( b).\n- This this statement suggests that both statements A and B are true. This is not necessarily true because statement A is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\n- **C. Neither (a) nor ( (b)**"
