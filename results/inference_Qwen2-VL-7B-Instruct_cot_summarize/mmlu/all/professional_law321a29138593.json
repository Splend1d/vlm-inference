                    "text": "A company incorporated and headquartered in State A sued a plumber domiciled in State B in a federal court in State A, alleging that the plumber had negligently installed pipes in a manner that resulted in $250,000 in damage to the company's headquarters building. In response to the complaint, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action. Sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the company asked the clerk to enter default, and the clerk did so. The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Personal Jurisdiction**: The court denied the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which means that the court had jurisdiction over the plumber. Therefore, the court did not lack personal jurisdiction over the plumber.\n\n2. **Default Judgment**: A default judgment is entered when a defendant fails to respond to a complaint within the required time. In this case, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action, and the company asked the clerk to enter default, which was done. The company then applied for a default judgment, and the court entered it after an ex parte hearing.\n\n3. **Motion to Set Aside**: The plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, which is a common remedy when a party feels that the default judgment was unjust or was entered improperly. The court has discretion to grant or deny such a motion.\n\n4. **Notice of Hearing**: The company notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. This notice is crucial because it allows the defendant to prepare a defense and attend the hearing. If the notice was inadequate, it could be grounds for setting aside the judgment.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment because the notice of the hearing was inadequate, which is a common ground for setting aside a default judgment. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment."
