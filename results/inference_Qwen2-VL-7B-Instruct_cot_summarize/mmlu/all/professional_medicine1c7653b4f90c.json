Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?\n\nA. Eustachian tube dysfunction\nB. Mucosal edema\nC. Nasal polyps\nD. Oral contraceptive use\n"

Mucosal edema\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat, along with the physical examination findings of tenderness over the left maxillary sinus and clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, suggest acute sinusitis. The presence of oral contraceptive use ( (D) is not typically associated with sinusitis, and the other options ( (A) Eustachian tube dysfunction, ( (C) Nasal polyps, and ( (D) Oral contraceptive use do not directly explain the symptoms described."
