Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be\n\nA. admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.\nB. admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.\nC. excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.\nD. excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.\n"

This is because it it is not relevant to the issue of whether the city was negligent in failing to provide adequate warning at the intersection. Instead, it is more likely to be prejudicial and confusing to the jury, as it may lead them to believe that the intersection is inherently safe, even though the injured driver was involved in a serious accident there. Therefore, the evidence should be excluded."
