In a strictly binary tree, the number of nodes \\( N \\) is related to the height \\( h \\) by the formula:\n\\[ N = 2^h - 1 \\]\n\nWe need to find the relationship between \\( h \\) and \\( N \\) that satisfies the given ratio bound.\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### A. \\( h \\le \\log_2(N) \\)\n\nIf \\( h \\le \\log_2(N) \\), then:\n\\[ N \\geq 2^h \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ 2^h - 1 \\geq 2^h \\]\nThis is not always true, as \\( 2^h - 1 \\) is always less than \\( 2^h \\) for \\( h > 0 \\).\n\n#### B. \\( h = \\frac{1}{c} \\log_2(N) \\)\n\nIf \\( h = \\frac{1}{c} \\log_2(N) \\), then:\n\\[ N = 2^{\\frac{1}{c} \\log_2(N)} \\]\n\\[ N = 2^{\\log_2(N)^{\\frac{1}{c}}} \\]\n\\[ N = N^{\\frac{1}{c}} \\]\nThis is not always true, as \\( N \\) is not necessarily equal to \\( N^{\\frac{1}{c}} \\).\n\n#### C. \\( h < c \\log_2(N) \\)\n\nIf \\( h < c \\log_2(N) \\), then:\n\\[ N > 2^{c \\log_2(N)} \\]\n\\[ N > N^c \\]\nThis is not always true, as \\( N \\) is not necessarily greater than \\( N^c \\).\n\n#### D. \\( h > c \\log_2(N) \\)\n\nIf \\( h > c \\log_2(N) \\), then:\n\\[ N < 2^{c \\log_2(N)} \\]\n\\[ N < N^c \\]\nThis is not always true, as \\( N \\) is not necessarily less than \\( N^c \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNone of the options directly satisfy the given conditions. However, the correct characterization of the height \\( h \\) of any tree in this class should be derived from the properties of strictly binary trees and the given ratio bound.\n\nGiven the properties of strictly binary trees and the ratio bound, the correct characterization should be:\n\n\\[ h \\le \\log_2(N) \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. \\( h \\le \\log_2(N) \\)**"
