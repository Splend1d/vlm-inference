The trial attorney failed to interview an alibi witness.\n\nThis fact directly relates to the attorney's's performance during the trial and could have a significant impact on the defense strategy. If the attorney did not interview an alibi witness, it could have led to a weak defense and potentially contributed to the conviction. This is a clear example of deficient performance by the attorney, which is a key element of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the Sixth Amendment."
