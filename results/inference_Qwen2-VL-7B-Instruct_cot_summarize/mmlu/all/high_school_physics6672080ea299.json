The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will not be 0 m^3.\n\nThe relationship between temperature (T ( in Kelvin), volume (V in m^3), and pressure (P ( in atm) for an ideal gas is given by the Ideal Gas Law:\n\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of moles of the gas and \\( r \\) is the gas constant ( (8.314 J/(mol\u00b7K) or 0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(mol\u00b7K) depending on the units used.\n\nRearranging the Ideal Gas Law to solve for \\( V \\):\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{nrt}{P} \\]\n\nThis equation shows that the volume \\( V \\) is inversely proportional to the pressure \\( P \\). Therefore, the slope of the graph of \\( V \\) versus \\( P \\) will be negative, indicating an inverse relationship.\n\nThe y-intercept of the graph will not be 0 m^3 because the volume \\( V \\) cannot be zero when the pressure \\( P \\) is not zero. The y-intercept will be a non-zero value, depending on the specific values of \\( n \\), \\( r \\), and \\( T \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is D."
