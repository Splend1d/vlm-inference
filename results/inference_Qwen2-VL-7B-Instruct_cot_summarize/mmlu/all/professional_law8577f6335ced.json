Duty of care\n2. Breach of that duty\n3. Causation ( (the breach caused the injury)\n4. Damages\n\nIn this case, the man is accused of negligence for washing his car on the street, which led to the ice forming and causing an accident.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The man was not aware of the ordinance.**\n   - This fact does not directly address the duty of care or the breach of that duty. It might be relevant to the man's state of mind but does not mitigate the negligence claim.\n\nB. **The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.**\n   - This fact suggests that the ordinance was put in place due to a similar incident, implying that the city recognized the risk posed by washing cars on the street. This could argue that the city was aware of the risk and thus the man was not acting negligently.\n\nC. **The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.**\n   - This fact provides evidence that the man was indeed washing his car on the street, which is the core of the negligence claim. It does not mitigate the negligence claim but rather supports it.\n\nD. **The driver is not a resident of the city.**\n   - This fact does not directly impact the duty of care or the breach of that duty. It might be relevant to jurisdiction but does not mitigate the negligence claim.\n\nGiven these analyses, the fact that would help the man the most is:\n\n**B. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.**\n\nThis fact suggests that the city recognized the risk posed by washing cars on the street, which could imply that the man was not acting negligently by following the city's own rules."
