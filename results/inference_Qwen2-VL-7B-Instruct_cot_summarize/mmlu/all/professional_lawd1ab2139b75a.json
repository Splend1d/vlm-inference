Which of the following statements about this law is most accurate as a matter of constitutional law?\n\nA. The one-year residence requirement is valid because it does not affect any fundamental right or suspect class.\nB. State durational residence requirements that are estab-lished for publicly funded services are constitutional because they relate to government operations reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Because publicly funded education is a fundamental constitutional right, a state may not deny it to any class of persons who reside in that state.\nD. State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

This type of requirement is typically used to limit the number of people who can receive certain public services, such as education, and is often justified as a way to control costs.\n\nIn this case, the law is likely intended to reduce the number of children who are eligible to attend public schools, which would in turn reduce the cost of providing those services. However, this type of law can raise constitutional concerns, particularly under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement about this law as a matter of constitutional law is:\n\nD. State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
