                    "text": "To determine how much kale would be needed to provide enough calories for a person for an entire year, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Calorie Content of Kale**: Kale is a nutrient-dense vegetable that provides a significant amount of calories per kilogram. According to various sources, kale can provide approximately 50-60 calories per 100 grams ( (0.22 pounds).\n\n2. **Daily Calorie Requirement**: The average daily calorie requirement for an adult can vary, but a commonly accepted range is around 2000-2500 calories per day.\n\n3. **Annual Calorie Requirement**: To find the annual calorie requirement, we multiply the daily calorie requirement by the number of days in a year ( (365 days).\n\nLet's calculate the annual calorie requirement:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Calorie Requirement} = \\text{Daily Calorie Requirement} \\times \\text{Number of Days in a Year} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Calorie Requirement} = 2000 \\text{ calories/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual Calorie Requirement} = 730,000 \\text{ calories/year} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the annual calorie requirement into kilograms of kale. Given that kale provides approximately 50-60 calories per kilogram, we can use the lower end of the calorie range for kale to ensure we have enough:\n\n\\[ \\text{Kale Needed} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Calorie Requirement}}{\\text{Calories per Kilogram of Kale}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Kale Needed} = \\frac{730,000 \\text{ calories/year}}{50 \\text{ calories/kg}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Kale Needed} = 14,600 \\text{ kg/year} \\]\n\nThis value is closest to option B: 2*10^4 kg/yr.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2*10^4 kg/yr"
