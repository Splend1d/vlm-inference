The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?\n\nA. Call her previous physician to obtain more history\nB. Order a chest x-ray\nC. Order a test for HIV antibody\nD. Repeat the PPD skin test\n"

The fact that the child has a positive PPD skin test suggests that she may have been exposed to TB. The parents' negative PPD skin tests do not necessarily rule out TB exposure, as the test may not be accurate in all cases. Therefore, repeating the PPD skin test is the most appropriate step at this time."
