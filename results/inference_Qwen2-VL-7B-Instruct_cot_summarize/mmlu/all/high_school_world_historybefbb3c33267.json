Dickens acknowledges both the positive and negative aspects of the revolution, suggesting that it was a time of great change and upheaval. He also the revolution was a time of both hope and despair, suggesting that it was a time of both progress and setbacks.\n\n2. **Wordsworth's View:**\n   - \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.\"\n   - This quote from \"The Prelude\" by William Wordsworth expresses a more enthusiastic and optimistic view of the French Revolution. Wordsworth emphasizes the excitement and hope that the dawn of the French Revolution brought to the world, particularly for the young generation.\n\nBased on this analysis, Dickens' view can be described as **cynical**, as he sees both the best and the worst of the revolution, and Wordsworth's view can be described as **enthusiastic**, as he sees the revolution as a time of great hope and excitement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Cynical, enthusiastic**"
