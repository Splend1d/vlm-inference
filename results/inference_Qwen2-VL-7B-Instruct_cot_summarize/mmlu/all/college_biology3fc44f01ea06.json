This gradient of H+ concentration drives the diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix, which is a key step in the chemiosmotic theory of ATP synthesis. This process is facilitated by the proton-motive force generated by the electron transport chain, which drives ATP synthesis in the matrix."
