Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate this:\n\n1. **GDP per capita in 1950**:\n   - Let's assume the GDP per capita in 1950 was $1,000.\n\n2. **GDP per capita in 2016**:\n   - Let's assume the GDP per capita in 2016 was $10,000.\n\n3. **Inflation Adjustment**:\n   - To adjust for inflation, we need to know the inflation rate over the period from 1950 to 2016. Let's assume the average annual inflation rate was 3%.\n   - The formula to adjust for inflation is: \\( \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Present Value} \\times ( (1 + \\text{Inflation Rate})^{\\text{Number of Years}} \\)\n   - Number of years = 2016 - 1950 = 66 years.\n   - \\( \\text{Future Value} = 1,000 \\times ( (1 + 0.03)^{66} \\approx 1,000 \\times 10.06 \\approx 10,060 \\)\n\n4. **PPP Adjustment**:\n   - To adjust for PPP, we need to know the PPP index for South Korea in 1950 and 2016. Let's assume the PPP index in 1950 was 1 and in 2016 was 2.5.\n   - The formula to adjust for PPP is: \\( \\text{Future Value} = \\text{Present Value} \\times \\text{PPP Index} \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Future Value} = 10,060 \\times 2.5 \\approx 25,150 \\)\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - To find the increase in GDP per capita, we divide the final adjusted value by the initial value.\n   - \\( \\text{Increase} = \\frac{25,150}{1,000} = 25.15 \\)\n\n6. **Interpreting the Increase**:\n   - The increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 is approximately 25.15 times the initial value.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. by 4 fold\nB. by 8 fold\nC. by 16 fold\nD. by 32 fold\n\nThe closest answer is:\nC. by 16 fold"
