The velocity of the ejected electrons is determined by the energy of the photon and the binding energy of the electron in the subshell.\n\nElectrons in the 3p subshell have the highest velocity after being ejected because they are in a higher energy level compared to electrons in the 1s, 2p, or 3d subshells. The higher the energy level, the more energy is required to remove an electron from that level, and thus, the higher the velocity of the ejected electron."
