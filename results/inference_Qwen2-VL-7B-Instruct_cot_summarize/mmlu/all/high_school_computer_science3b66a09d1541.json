Some parts of the program can be expressed as binary code, but operations must be expressed using a higher-level programming language.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- A. This statement is incorrect because a program can indeed be expressed as binary code, which is the machine-readable form of the program. While higher-level languages are easier for humans to understand, binary code is necessary for the computer to execute the program.\n  \n- B. This statement is incorrect because binary code is not inherently error-free. Errors can occur during the translation from a higher-level language to binary code, or during the execution of the binary code.\n  \n- C. This statement is incorrect because while binary code is used to represent data, it is also also used to represent instructions. A program is a sequence of instructions, which can be expressed in binary code.\n  \n- D. This statement is correct because while some parts of a program, such as the instructions for arithmetic operations, can be expressed directly in binary code, other parts, such as control flow ( (e ( statements, loops, and conditionalsals, must be expressed using a higher-level programming language."
