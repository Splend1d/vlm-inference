The maximum number of connected components occurs when the graph is completely disconnected, meaning each node forms its own separate component. Since there are 10 nodes, the maximum number of connected components is 10.\n\nNext, let's consider the minimum number of connected components (m. The minimum number of connected components occurs when the graph is fully connected, meaning there is a single component that includes all 10 nodes. Therefore, the minimum number of connected components is 1.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\nB. M = 10, m = 1"
