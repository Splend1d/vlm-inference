An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.\n\nAn executed contract is typically defined as a contract where both parties have completed their obligations, and there are no further duties or obligations remaining. However, this definition is somewhat broad and can be interpreted in different ways. The other options are more precise and align better with the typical understanding of the terms \"executory contract,\" \"partially executed contract,\" and \"wholly executory contract.\"\n\n- A wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party.\n- A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\n- A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance.\n\nThese definitions are more specific and align better with the typical understanding of the terms."
