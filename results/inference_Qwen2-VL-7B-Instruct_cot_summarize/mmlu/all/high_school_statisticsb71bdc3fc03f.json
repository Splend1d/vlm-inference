If n is large, no matter what the distribution of of the original population.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size (n increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is true even if the original population distribution is not normal. The theorem holds as long as the sample size is sufficiently large, typically considered to be at least 30 or more, depending on the skewness of the population distribution."
