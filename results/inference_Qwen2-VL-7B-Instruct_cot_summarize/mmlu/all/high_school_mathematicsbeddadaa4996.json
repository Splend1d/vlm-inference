The general form of a quadratic expression is $ax^2+bx+c$, and when we complete the square, we aim to rewrite it in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$.\n\nGiven the expression $-2x^2-20x-53$, we first factor out the coefficient of $x^2$ ( which is $-2$ from the first two terms:\n\n$$-2(x^2+10x)-53$$\n\nNow, to complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses, we need to add and subtract the square of of half the coefficient of $x$. The coefficient of $x$ is $10$, so half of it is $5$, and its square is $25$. We add and subtract $25$ inside the parentheses, but since we're factoring out a $-2$, we actually add $-2*25=-50$ outside the parentheses to keep the equation balanced:\n\n$$-2[(x^2+10x+25)-25]-53$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$-2[(x+5)^2-25]-53$$\n\nNow, distribute the $-2$:\n\n$$-2(x+5)^2+50-53$$\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n$$-2(x+5)^2-3$$\n\nSo, in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$, we have $a=-2$, $d=5$, and $e=-3$. The sum $a+d+e$ is:\n\n$$-2+5-3 = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0."
