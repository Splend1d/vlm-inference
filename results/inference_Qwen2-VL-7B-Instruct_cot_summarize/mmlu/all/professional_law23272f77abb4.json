The neighbor wheeled his lawn mower to the man's property and started the engine. At that moment, the man suddenly yelled, \"I hereby revoke my offer. \"If the neighbor thereafter mows the man's lawn, will he recover the $50?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\nB. Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\nC. No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\nD. No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation.\n"
