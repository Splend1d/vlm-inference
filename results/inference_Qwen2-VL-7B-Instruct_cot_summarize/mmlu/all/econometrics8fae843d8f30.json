(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\n(i) The standard error will be positively related to the residual variance: This is true because the standard error of of the slope coefficient is calculated using the residual variance. The larger the residual variance, the larger the standard error.\n\n(ii) The standard error will be negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value: This is true because the standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sum of squares of the deviations of the explanatory variable from its mean. The larger the dispersion of the explanatory variable, the smaller the standard error.\n\n(iii) The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size: This is true because the standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. The larger the the sample size, the smaller the standard error.\n\n(iv) The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate: This is true because the standard error is a measure of the variability of the coefficient estimate. The smaller the standard error, the more precise the coefficient estimate."
