If seven pens cost $9.24, then the cost of one pen is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\frac{\\$9.24}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pen} = \\$1.32 \\]\n\nNow, we know that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. Since one pen costs $1.32, three pens would cost:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\$1.32 = \\$3.96 \\]\n\nTherefore, eleven pencils cost $3.96. To find the cost of one pencil, we divide this amount by 11:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{\\$3.96}{11} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\$0.36 \\]\n\nConverting this to cents gives us:\n\n\\[ 36 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nSo, the cost of one pencil is 36 cents, which corresponds to option C."
