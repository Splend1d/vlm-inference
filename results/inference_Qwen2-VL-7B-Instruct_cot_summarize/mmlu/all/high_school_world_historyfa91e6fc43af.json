To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism is undermined by the first passage, we need to carefully analyze the content and context of the passage.\n\nThe passage by William Bentinck, Governor-General of India, discusses the practice of sati, which involves the burning of widows alive in India. Bentinck argues that continuing this practice is a moral responsibility, as it involves the consignment of of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end. However, he also also that discontinuing the practice could put the safety of the British Empire in India at risk, which he considers a greater evil.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfere with native religious practices\n- This option is plausible because the passage mentions the practice of sati, which is a religious practice. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the British Empire interfered with native religious practices in general.\n\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits\n- The passage does not discuss the economic motives of the British Empire. It focuses on the moral and political implications of discontinuing sati.\n\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations\n- This option is plausible because the passage mentions the British Empire's concern for the safety of the empire, which could be interpreted as a desire to impose their cultural norms on the native population.\n\nD. That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects\n- The passage does not discuss the use of armed force. It focuses on the moral and political implications of discontinuing sati.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage does not explicitly undermine the assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. Instead, it discusses the moral and political implications of discontinuing sati.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations"
