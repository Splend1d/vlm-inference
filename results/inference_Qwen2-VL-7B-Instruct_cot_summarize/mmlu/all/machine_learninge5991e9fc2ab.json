Convolving an image with $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{matrix}$\n\nThis kernel is the identity matrix. When you convolve an image with the identity matrix, the result is the original image because each element of the kernel is 1, and multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value. Therefore, this kernel would not change the image.\n\nB. Convolving an image with $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}$\n\nThis kernel is a row of zeros except for the middle element, which is 1. When you convolve an image with this kernel, it will only affect the middle row of the image, leaving the rest of the image unchanged. Therefore, this kernel would not change the image.\n\nC. Convolving an image with $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{matrix}$\n\nThis kernel is a matrix of all 1s. When you convolve an image with this kernel, each pixel in the image will be replaced by the average of its neighbors ( plus the value of the pixel itself. This This kernel would change the image.\n\nD. Convolve an image with $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}$\n\nThis kernel is a matrix of all zeros. When you convolve an image with this kernel, each pixel in the image will be replaced by the average of its neighbors ( plus the value of the pixel itself. This kernel would change the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Convolving an image with $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{matrix}$ would not change the image."
