                    "text": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true about optical isomerism of complexes containing achiral ligands.\n\nA. **Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Optical isomerism in square planar complexes can occur even if the ligands are not identical. The presence of a chiral center ( typically due to the coordination of a chiral ligand or the presence of a chiral environment \u2014 is sufficient for optical isomerism.\n\nB. **Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if they contain chiral ligands or if the coordination environment is chiral. However, if all ligands are achiral and the coordination environment is achiral, tetrahedral complexes do not display optical isomerism.\n\nC. **Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Linear complexes do not display optical isomerism because they lack the necessary symmetry to form a chiral center. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, which is not present in linear complexes.\n\nD. **Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism even if they have only two different ligands. The presence of a chiral ligand or a chiral environment is sufficient for optical isomerism.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the provided statements are true. However, if we must choose the closest to being true, it is important to note that the correct understanding is that optical isomerism in complexes containing achiral ligands can occur under specific conditions, but none of the options provided accurately describe these conditions."
