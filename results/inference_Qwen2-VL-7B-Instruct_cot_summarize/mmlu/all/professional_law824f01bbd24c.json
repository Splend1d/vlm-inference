The CEO of the new business told the widget maker's manager that a substantial profit hinged on receiving the widgets. The manufacturer discovered it could not produce the widgets due to equipment failures. The business sued the manufacturer for breach of contract, claiming lost profits of $10 million. The CEO testified to the company's projected sales in detail. A qualified expert supported his lost profit projections; there was no expert testimony by the manufacturer. Will the court allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages?\n\nA. No, despite the expert testimony, anticipated profits for a new company are too speculative and are not awarded.\nB. No, because the equipment failures were an excusable occurrence that the manufacturer could not foresee.\nC. Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\nD. Yes, a new company can usually collect its lost profits because it is easier to prove than if the company had many accounts to complicate its projections.\n"

Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\n\nThe court is likely to allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Expert Testimony**: The CEO provided detailed projections of the company's sales, and a qualified expert supported these projections. This expert testimony provides a credible basis for the court to consider the lost profits.\n\n2. **Lack of Counter-Evidence**: The manufacturer did not provide any expert testimony or evidence to refute the company's claims. This absence of counter-evidence makes it more likely that the court will find the company's claims credible.\n\n3. **Breach of Contract**: The court would typically consider whether the manufacturer breached the contract by failing to deliver the widgets. If the equipment failures were indeed unforeseeable and unavoidable, the court might still find the manufacturer liable for breach of contract, especially if the failures were not due to negligence or other avoidable causes.\n\n4. **Provingability of Lost Profits**: While proving lost profits can be challenging, especially for a new business, the court might be more inclined to award damages if the evidence presented is compelling and supported by expert testimony.\n\nTherefore, the court is more likely to award the lost profits damages based on the evidence presented by the company, including the expert testimony."
