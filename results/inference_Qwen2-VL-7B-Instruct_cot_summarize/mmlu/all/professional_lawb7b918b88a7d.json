Another customer, who had not been threatened by the woman, forcefully grabbed the woman and locked her in the tavern's storeroom until the police could arrive. In the process, although the customer used reasonable force, the customer badly sprained the woman's wrist. Is the woman likely to recover in an action against the customer?\n\nA. No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\nB. Yes, based on battery only.\nC. Yes, based on false imprisonment only.\nD. Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n"

Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n\nThe customer's conduct can be analyzed under two legal doctrines: battery and false imprisonment. \n\n1. **Battery**: The customer used reasonable force to prevent the woman from harming others, which is a justifiable use of force. However, the customer's conduct also resulted in the woman's wrist being badly sprained. This physical harm constitutes a battery.\n\n2. **False Imprisonment**: The customer locked the woman in the storeroom, which is a form of restraint of her freedom of movement. This act constitutes false imprisonment.\n\nGiven that both battery and false imprisonment occurred, the woman is likely to recover in an action against the customer based on both claims."
