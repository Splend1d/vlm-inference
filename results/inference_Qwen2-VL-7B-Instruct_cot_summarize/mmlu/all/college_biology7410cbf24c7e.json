A moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee.\n\nBatesian mimicry is a type of mimicry in which a harmless or less toxic species (the mimic) resembles a harmful or more toxic species (the model). The resemblance confuses predators, leading them to avoid the mimic. In this case, the moth mimicking the stinging bee is an example of Batesian mimicry."
