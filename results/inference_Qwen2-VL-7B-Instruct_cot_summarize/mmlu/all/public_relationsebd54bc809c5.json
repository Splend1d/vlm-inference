Then, the number of unique news events would be approximately equal to the number of stories.\n   - Therefore, the number of actual news events is approximately 14,000.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest and most reasonable answer is:\n\n**C. 326**\n\nThis is a hypothetical calculation to illustrate the concept, but it's important to note that the exact number would depend on the specific overlap and reporting patterns."
