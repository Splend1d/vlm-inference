Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?\n\nA. G0\nB. G1\nC. G2\nD. M\n"

When p53 is mutated, it leads to an inactive gene product, which can result in the failure of the cell to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) or to undergo cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This can allow the cell to continue to divide uncontrollably, leading to the progression of of the tumor."
