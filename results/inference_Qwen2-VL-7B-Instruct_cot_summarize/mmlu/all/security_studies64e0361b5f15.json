Let's analyze each option to understand the challenges involved:\n\nA. **Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.**\n   - This option highlights the importance of the sufficiency of the coercive measures. However, it does not address the broader issue of defining success in terms of compliance alone. Success should also consider the broader impact and long-term effects of the coercion.\n\nB. **Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equate to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.**\n   - This option suggests that success is independent of the amount of coercion used. While it acknowledges that coercion is a tool, it does not address the issue of whether the intended outcome is achieved or not.\n\nC. **In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.**\n   - This option recognizes that success in coercive diplomacy can be measured in terms of tactical/temporary successes, but it does not address the issue of whether the intended outcome is achieved or not.\n\nD. **Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducement may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.**\n   - This option recognizes that the cost of coercion can vary and that compliance should be considered a success if the outcome is lasting. However, it does not address the issue of whether the intended outcome is achieved or not.\n\nIn conclusion, the most problematic aspect of defining coercive diplomacy success is that it often fails to consider whether the intended outcome is achieved or not. Success should be measured in terms of whether the coercion has achieved the desired outcome, not just whether compliance has been achieved."
