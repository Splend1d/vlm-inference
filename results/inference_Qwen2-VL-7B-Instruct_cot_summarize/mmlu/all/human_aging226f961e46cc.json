This is because understanding the underlying causes of diseases can lead to preventative measures and interventions that can reduce the risk of developing certain diseases. For example, if researchers discover that a particular lifestyle factor, such as smoking or poor diet, is a major contributor to the development of heart disease and cancer, they can develop public health campaigns and interventions to encourage people to adopt healthier lifestyles. This can help to reduce the incidence of these diseases and improve overall health outcomes for older adults."
