The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?\n\nA. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\nB. No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.\nC. Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.\nD. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\n"

Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\n\nIn this scenario, the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations and had no other available rental trucks of the same type. The landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000 was made under the necessity of the situation, and the modified contract price ($14,000) did not exceed a reasonable price given the circumstances. Therefore, the mechanic can enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000."
