One day that employee came uninvited into the owner's office brandishing a loaded shotgun, approached the owner's desk and raised the weapon. The owner, however, was secretly waiting for the opportunity. As the employee began to press on the trigger, the owner pulled a gun from her drawer and killed him. The owner admitted she felt malice toward her enemy. The authorities charged her with murder. Can she be convicted?\n\nA. No, because she acted in self-defense.\nB. No, because these facts constitute justifiable homicide.\nC. Yes, because she had been lying in wait for the victim.\nD. Yes, because the owner cannot claim self-defense when her motive is evil.\n"

If the owner had a motive that was considered evil, such as malice or revenge, she would not be able to claim self-defense. The fact that the owner was waiting for the opportunity and had a premeditated intent to harm the former employee suggests that her motive was not purely defensive but rather malicious. Therefore, she would not be able to successfully claim self-defense."
