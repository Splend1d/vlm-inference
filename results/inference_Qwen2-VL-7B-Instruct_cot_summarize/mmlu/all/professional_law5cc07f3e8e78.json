The current lessee of the premises, who had made substantial improvements to the property, wanted to buy at the full list price but needed extra time. He paid $10,000 for an option to be added to the lease, giving him an option to buy on or before Sept. 1. The option stated that all notices required under it \"shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party to receive the Notice\" That notice was required by Sept. 1. Buyer called Seller on Aug. 25 and told her that he was exercising the option, but Seller did not remember the words used. The Buyer sent written intent to exercise it by first class mail on Aug. 29 but the Seller later testified that she did not receive it until September 3. On September 10 she notified Buyer that the option expired and the deal was off. Buyer filed a specific performance action to compel the transaction. Is it likely that the Equity Court will grant the request for specific performance?\n\nA. Yes, the exercise of an option is not considered to be a situation where \"time is of the essence\" of the agreement, and options are liberally enforced so that the benefit of the bargain is not unreasonably lost.\nB. Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\nC. No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.\nD. No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.\n"

                    "text": "The Equity Court is likely to grant the request for specific performance in this case. The key factors that support this conclusion include:\n\n1. **Exercise of Option**: The lessee exercised the option by sending a written notice to the seller on August 29, which was received by the seller on September 3. This exercise of the option was timely according to the terms of the option agreement.\n\n2. **Notice Requirement**: The option agreement specifies that notices are to be given in writing and delivered in a manner that ensures receipt. The lessee sent the notice by first-class mail, which is a form of written notice. Although the seller claims she did not receive the notice until September 3, the lessee's intent to exercise the option was timely.\n\n3. **Equity's Discretion**: Equity courts generally enforce option agreements liberally to avoid the loss of the benefit of the bargain. The lessee's exercise of the option was timely, and the delay in receiving the notice was not due to any fault of the lessee.\n\n4. **Hardship to the Lessee**: The lessee has made substantial improvements to the property and would suffer hardship if the option were not enforced. The court is likely to consider this hardship in favor of enforcing the option.\n\n5. **Specific Performance**: The lessee's request for specific performance is supported by the fact that the lessee's exercise of the option was timely and the seller's delay in receiving the notice was not due to any fault of the lessee.\n\nGiven these points, the Equity Court is likely to grant the request for specific performance, as it would be unfair to deny the lessee the benefit of the bargain and the lessee would suffer hardship if the option were not enforced. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice."
