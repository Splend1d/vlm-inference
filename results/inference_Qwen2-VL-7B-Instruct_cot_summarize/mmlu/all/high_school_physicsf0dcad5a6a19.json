So the equation becomes:\n\nt = v / a\n\nWe know that the car needs to cover a distance of 200 meters, but we don't have the final velocity. However, we can use the equation of motion:\n\ns = ut + 0.5at^2\n\nwhere:\ns is the distance ( (200 m in this case)\nu is the initial velocity ( (0 in this case)\na is the acceleration ( (5 in/s^2 in this case)\nt is the time\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for time:\n\nt = sqrt(2s / a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = sqrt(2 * 200 / 5) = sqrt(80) = 8.944\n\nSo the time it it would take for the car to cover a distance of 200 meters starting from rest and accelerating uniformly at 5 m/s^2 is approximately 8.944 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not listed in the options provided."
