We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\n\"Muckraking\" author Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives best exemplifies which of the following quotes from the excerpt above?\n\nA. the duty laid upon us by our fathers\nB. masters of their Constitution\nC. an instrument of injustice\nD. without which no republic can endure\n"

                    "text": "To determine which quote from the Progressive Party Platform, 1912, best exemplifies Jacob A. Riis's \"How the Other Half Lives,\" we need to analyze the context and core message of both the the Progressive Party Platform and Riis's work.\n\n1. **\"The duty laid upon us by our fathers\"**:\n   - This quote emphasizes the responsibility and duty inherited from the founders of the country. It speaks to the idea of maintaining the government and its principles as established by the founders.\n\n2. **\"masters of their Constitution\"**:\n   - This quote highlights the idea that the people are the ultimate rulers and decision-makers of the Constitution. It underscores the democratic principle that the Constitution is for the people and by the people.\n\n3. **\"an instrument of injustice\"**:\n   - This quote suggests that the Constitution can be used for unjust purposes if not properly maintained. It implies that the Constitution must be safeguarded from misuse.\n\n4. **\"without which no republic can endure\"**:\n   - This quote emphasizes the importance of maintaining the Constitution and the principles it embodies. It suggests that without these principles, the republic cannot survive.\n\nNow, let's consider Jacob A. Riis's \"How the Other Half Lives\":\n- Riis's work is a critique of the social and economic conditions in the United States, particularly focusing on the harsh realities faced by the working class and the poor.\n- His work highlights the injustices and inequalities in society, which aligns with the idea of the Constitution being used as an instrument of injustice if not properly maintained.\n\nGiven this analysis, the quote that best exemplifies Jacob A. Riis's critique in \"How the Other Half Lives\" is:\n\n**C. an instrument of injustice**\n\nThis quote reflects the idea that the Constitution can be used for unjust purposes if not properly maintained, which is a central theme in Riis's work."
