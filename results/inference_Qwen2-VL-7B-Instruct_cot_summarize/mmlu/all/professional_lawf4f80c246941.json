Five months into the lease, the tenant failed to pay rent. The landlord then sued the tenant for possession for nonpayment of rent. The tenant successfully defended this suit on the ground that the apartment was uninhabitable and that, accordingly, no rent was properly payable. On May 7, immediately following the court order in the tenant's favor, the landlord served the tenant with a written but not notarized notice to terminate the tenancy and to vacate the apartment on or before June 30. On July 1, the tenant was still in possession, nothing had changed, and the landlord brought an appropriate action for possession. The tenant prevailed. What is the most likely reason for the court's decision?\n\nA. A six-month notice was required to terminate this periodic tenancy.\nB. The landlord did not give the tenant a notarized notice of termination.\nC. The landlord was attempting to terminate the tenancy as a reaction to the tenant's defense in the previous lawsuit.\nD. The landlord's notice to terminate was improper, because it was given to the tenant more than one month before the required termination date.\n"

The landlord's notice to terminate was improper, because it was given to the tenant more than one month before the required termination date.\n\nIn a month-to-month lease, a landlord typically needs to provide a written notice to terminate the tenancy at least one month in advance of the desired termination date. The notice must be given at the beginning of the month, and it must be in writing. In this case, the landlord served the tenant with a notice to terminate the tenancy on June 30, but the notice was notarized, which is not required by law. Additionally, the notice was given more than one month before the required termination date, which is also improper. Therefore, the court likely ruled in favor of the tenant because the landlord's notice was improper."
