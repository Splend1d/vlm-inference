As the boss stood up to leave the table, her wallet fell out of her pocketbook onto the floor. The boss was unaware of what occurred and proceeded to the bathroom. The woman, however, saw the wallet fall. Intending to steal it, the woman picked up the wallet and placed it in her pocket. Before the boss returned to the table, the woman had a change of heart and decided to give the wallet back. Thereupon, the woman told her boss what had happened and handed her the wallet when she returned from the bathroom. The woman is guilty of which, if any, crime?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Larceny.\nC. Embezzlement.\nD. False pretenses.\n"

However, the scenario indicates that she initially intended to steal the wallet and only later decided to return it, which suggests she had the intent to steal initially.\n\nB. **Larceny.** - Larceny is the crime of stealing property without the owner's consent. The woman initially intended to steal the wallet, which fits the definition of larceny.\n\nC. **Embezzlement.** - Embezzlement involves the fraudulent conversion of property that the person has in his or her possession by reason of his or her public or private trust. The woman did not have a public or private trust in this scenario, as she did not have possession of the wallet initially.\n\nD. **False pretenses.** - False pretenses involves making a false representation with the intent to deceive and induce another to part with property. This crime is not applicable here as there was no false representation or deception involved.\n\nGiven the scenario, the woman initially intended to steal the wallet, which aligns with the definition of larceny. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. Larceny.**"
