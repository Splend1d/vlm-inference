Annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance: $2.76 per $1,000\n\nTo find the value of the insurance, we need to calculate the cost of the insurance based on the IRS established uniform cost of insurance rate:\n\nValue of insurance = ( (200,000 / 1,000) * 2.76 = $552,000\n\nTherefore, Johnson must include $552,000 in gross income.
