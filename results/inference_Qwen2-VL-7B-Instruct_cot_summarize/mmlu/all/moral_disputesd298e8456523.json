The core of the question is to identify which of the given options best represents de Marneffe's argument.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. Fatty foods and tobacco products are not actually harmful.\n- This option suggests that de Marneffe argues that these products are not harmful. However, the objection is about the morality of prohibiting these products, not about their actual harm.\n\nB. There is nothing wrong with limiting people's access to products that are harmful to them.\n- This option suggests that de Marneffe argues that it is morally acceptable to limit access to harmful products. This alignss with the objection that it it would be wrong to prohibit these products.\n\nC. The benefits of prohibiting these products would not outweigh the costs.\n- This option suggests that de Marneffe argues that the benefits of prohibiting these products do not justify the costs. This does not directly address the objection about the morality of prohibition.\n\nD. All of the above.\n- This option suggests that de Marneffe argues all of the above points. However, option B is the most relevant to the objection about the morality of prohibition.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate representation of de Marneffe's argument is:\n\nB. There is nothing wrong with limiting people's access to products that are harmful to them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
