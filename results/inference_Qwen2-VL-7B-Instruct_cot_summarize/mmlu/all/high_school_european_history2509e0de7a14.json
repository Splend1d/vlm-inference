It addresses two main points:\n1. The recollection of past troubles and conflicts should be forgotten.\n2. The Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion should be restored and freely practiced in France, and the Reformed religion should be permitted to live and abide without hindrance.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the passage:\n\nA. Henry IV was a Catholic\n- The passage mentions the restoration of the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion, which implies that Henry IV was Catholic. This is a reasonable inference.\n\nB. Henry IV was a Protestant\n- The passage does not mention Henry IV being a Protestant. It specifically mentions the restoration of the Catholic religion, which implies he was Catholic. This option is incorrect.\n\nC. prior to 1598, France had been free of religious conflict\n- The passage states that the recollection of past troubles and conflicts should be forgotten, implying that there were significant religious conflict prior to 1598. This option is incorrect.\n\nD. prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict\n- The passage states that the recollection of past troubles and conflicts should be forgotten, implying that there were significant religious conflict prior to 1598. This option is correct.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct inference is:\n\nD. prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict"
