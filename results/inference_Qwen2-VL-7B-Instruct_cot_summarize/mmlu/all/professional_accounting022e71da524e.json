Move detailed analytical procedures from year-end to interim.\n\nThis response is appropriate because it indicates a shift in the audit strategy to address the increased risk identified during the interim audit. By moving detailed analytical procedures to the interim period, the auditor can more closely monitor and assess the accounts receivable balance throughout the year, rather than relying solely on year-end procedures. This can help in identifying and mitigatingting risks more effectively."
