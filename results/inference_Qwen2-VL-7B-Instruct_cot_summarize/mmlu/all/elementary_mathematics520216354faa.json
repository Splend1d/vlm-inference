Point B is 5 less than point A. Therefore, we can calculate the position of point B as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Position of Point B} = \\text{Position of Point A} - 5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Position of Point B} = -20 - 5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Position of Point B} = -25 \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. It is located at -25 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\n- This is incorrect because -25 is to the left of -20, not to the right.\n\nB. It is located at -15 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\n- This is incorrect because -15 is to the right of -20, not -25.\n\nC. It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n- This is incorrect because -25 is to the left of -20, not to the right.\n\nD. It is located at -15 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n- This is incorrect because -15 is to the right of -20, not -25.\n\nNone of the provided options are correct based on the calculations. However, the correct position of point B is -25, which is to the left of point A on the number line. Therefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline."
