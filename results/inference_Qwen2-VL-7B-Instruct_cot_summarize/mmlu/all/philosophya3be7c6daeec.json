Let's analyze each option to determine which best explains why an unexamined life cannot be virtuous:\n\nA. This option suggests that someone could be considered virtuous by others even if they do not know the principles for good living. However, this contradicts Socrates' view that virtue requires self-examination and understanding of the principles of good living. Thus, this option does not align with Socrates' reasoning.\n\nB. This option suggests that Socrates thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not. While this might be true, it does not directly address why an unexamined life is not virtuous. It merely states Socrates' perspective on the examined life.\n\nC. This option suggests that without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated. This directly aligns with Socrates' view that virtue requires understanding the principles behind actions. Without this understanding, actions cannot be justified or repeated, making the life unvirtuous.\n\nD. This option suggests that a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own. While this might be true, it does not directly address why an unexamineded life is not virtuous. It merely states that virtue involves examining views other than one's own.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for why an unexamineded life is not virtuous is provided by option C.\n\nFinal answer: C. Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated."
