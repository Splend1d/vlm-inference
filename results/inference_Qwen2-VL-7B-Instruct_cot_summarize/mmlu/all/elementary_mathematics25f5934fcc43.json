Here, I'll use the prime factorization method.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of each number:\n\n- The prime factorization of 4 is \\(2^2\\).\n- The prime factorization of 10 is \\(2 \\times 5\\).\n\nNow, to find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of either number:\n\n- The highest power of 2 that appears is \\(2^2\\) ( (from 4).\n- The highest power of 5 that appears is \\(5^1\\) ( (from 10).\n\nMultiplying these together gives us the LCM:\n\n\\[LCM = 2^2 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\]\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20, which corresponds to option B."
