These obligations are based on the principle that states have a duty to take reasonable steps to protect individuals from harm, including harm caused by other individuals or entities.\n\nThe ECtHR has developed positive obligations in a number of contexts, including:\n\n  * When the applicant is in the custody of the state ( (Article 3 ECHR)\n  * Where the state must investigate claims against it ( (Article 2 ECHR)\n  * The development of a legal framework to protect those within the state ( (Article 14 ECHR)\n\nThe ECtHR has not developed a positive obligation to provide housing for all those homeless within a state. This is because the right to housing is not explicitly recognized in the European Convention on Human Rights."
