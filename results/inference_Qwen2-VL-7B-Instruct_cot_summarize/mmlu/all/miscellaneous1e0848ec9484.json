Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline serve to amplify tidal flow at specific localities.\n\nThe tidal range, or the difference between high and low tide, is influenced by several factors, including the shape and depth of the ocean floor, the configuration of the coastline, and the Coriolis effect. The Coriolis effect, which is caused by the Earth's rotation, can enhance tidal flow in higher latitudes, but it is not the primary reason for large tidal ranges in specific localities. Trade winds do not significantly affect tidal ranges. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
