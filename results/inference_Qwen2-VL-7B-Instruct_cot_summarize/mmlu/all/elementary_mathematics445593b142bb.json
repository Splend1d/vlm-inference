Since there are 9 white soccer balls out of a total of 30, we subtract the white soccer balls from the total to find the number of non-white soccer balls:\n\n\\[30 - 9 = 21\\]\n\nSo, there are 21 non-white soccer balls. Since the remaining soccer balls are blue, pink, or green, and these three colors are equally represented, we divide the 21 non-white soccer balls by 3 to find out how many of each color there are:\n\n\\[21 \\div 3 = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, Coach Wu has 7 green soccer balls.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 7"
