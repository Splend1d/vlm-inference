Deception is prohibited whether the pain is physical or psychological in nature.\n\nIn research involving deception, especially when it may cause pain, ethical guidelines generally prohibit the use of deception. This is because deception can lead to significant harm, and the potential benefits of the research must be weighed against the risks involved. Therefore, deception is not acceptable unless it is absolutely necessary and the risks are minimized as much as possible."
