In order to ensure the availability of sites for the disposal of spent fuel from the nuclear power plant, the state refused to supply electric power to out- of-state purchasers residing in states that would not accept spent fuel from the plant for storage or disposal. Assume that no federal statute applies. Which of the following is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional?\n\nA. A state may condition the sale to out-of-state purchasers of any products produced in that state on the willingness of those purchasers to bear the fair share of the environmental costs of producing those products.\nB. The generation of electricity is intrastate by nature and therefore subject to plenary state control.\nC. The state itself owns and operates the power system, and therefore its refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause.\nD. The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n"

The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n\nThis argument is the strongest because it it directly addresses the core concern of the state's action: ensuring the availability of sites for the disposal of spent fuel from the nuclear power plant. By rationinging the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens, the state is justifying its action as a necessary measure to protect its citizens from potential environmental risks associated with the disposal of nuclear waste. This rationale alignss with the state's interest in maintaining public safety and health, which is a legitimate and constitutionally permissible reason for regulating commerce.\n\nThe other options do not provide as strong an argument:\n\nA. While this option suggests that states may condition the sale of products on the willingness of purchasers to bear environmental costs, it does not specifically address the disposal of nuclear waste.\nB. This option asserts that the generation of electricity is intrastate and subject to state control, but it does not directly address the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\nC. This option suggests that the state's refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the commerce clause because the state owns and operates the power system, but it does not directly address the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n\nTherefore, option D is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional."
