Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction and have non-terminating, non-repeating decimal expansions. Examples include \u03c0 ( (pi), \u221a2 ( (square root of 2), and e ( (Euler's number).\n\nii. Uncodified numbers are numbers that do not follow a specific pattern or rule and are not easily predictable.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 3,4\n- 3 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 3/1).\n- 4 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 4/1).\n- Both are rational and codified.\n\nB. 1,3\n- 1 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 1/1).\n- 3 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 3/1).\n- Both are rational and codified.\n\nC. 2,3\n- 2 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 2/1).\n- 3 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 3/1).\n- Both are rational and codified.\n\nD. 4,1\n- 4 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 4/1).\n- 1 is a rational number ( (it can be expressed as a fraction, 1/1).\n- Both are rational and codified.\n\nNone of the pairs listed are irrational and uncodified. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D are correct based on the given criteria.\n\nHowever, if we consider the question to be asking for the pairs that are not irrational and uncodified, then all options are incorrect because none of them meet the criteria of being irrational and uncodified."
