However, it is estimated that the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter, and that radio telescopes have been operating for about 100 years. Therefore, it is likely that only a very small fraction of the observable universe has received radio transmissions from Earth. The most likely answer is B, 10^-29%."
