When learning an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) for a fixed set of observations, increasing the number of hidden states can indeed increase the training data likelihood. This is because a model with more hidden states has more parameters to fit the data, which can lead to a better fit.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Collaborative filtering is not a model for modeling users' movie preference. It is a technique used in recommendation systems to predict the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users. It."
