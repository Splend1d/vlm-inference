M-7\u2019s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n- Throughput is the number of instructions executed per clock cycle.\n- For M-5: Throughput = 1 instruction per 10 nanoseconds = 0.1 instructions per nanosecond.\n- For M-7: Throughput = 1 instruction per 7.5 nanoseconds = 0.133 instructions per nanosecond.\n- Therefore, M-7 has a higher throughput than M-5.\n\n#### II. The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n- Latency is the time it takes for a single instruction to complete.\n- For M-5: Latency = 10 nanoseconds.\n- For M-7: Latency = 7.5 nanoseconds.\n- Therefore, the latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\n#### III. Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. While M-7 has a shorter latency and higher throughput, the overall performance also depends on the specific program and its instruction mix. Some programs might benefit more from the longer pipeline stages of M-5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis:\n- Statement I is true.\n- Statement II is true.\n- Statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. II only**"
