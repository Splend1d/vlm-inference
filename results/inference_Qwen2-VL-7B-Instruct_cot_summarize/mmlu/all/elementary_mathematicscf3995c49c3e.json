Triangles have 3 sides.\n\nB. All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.\n- This statement is correct. An octagon has 8 sides, which makes it a polygon. Polygons are defined as closed shapes with three or more sides.\n\nC. All parallelograms are rectangles because they have 2 sets of parallel sides.\n- This statement is incorrect. Parallelograms have 2 sets of parallel sides, but rectangles are a specific of parallelograms where all angles are right angles (90 degrees). Not all parallelograms are rectangles.\n\nD. All rhombi are squares because they have 4 sides that are all the same length.\n- This statement is incorrect. Rhombi are defined as quadrilaterals with all sides of equal length. Squares are a specific of rhombi where all angles are right angles (90 degrees). Not all rhombi are squares.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nB. All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides."
