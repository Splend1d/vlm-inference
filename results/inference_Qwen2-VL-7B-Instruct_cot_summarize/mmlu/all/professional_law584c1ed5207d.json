As she swung across the center line into the southbound lane, her vehicle collided with a fire engine. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching an owner's house, which was entirely destroyed by fire.

This is because the businesswoman's actions, by causing the fire engine to be delayed in reaching the owner's house, directly contributed to the destruction of the house. The statute making it a misdemeanor for a motor vehicle to travel to the left of the center line of a two-way highway, road, or street was designed to prevent accidents and protect public safety. By violating this statute, the businesswoman's actions led to the fire engine's delay, which in turn caused the fire to spread and destroy the house. Therefore, the owner can recover the fair market value of the house before the fire as a result of the businesswoman's negligence."
