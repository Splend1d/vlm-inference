We can do this by subtractinging 190 from the total number of muffins, which is 232. Then, we divide the result by 6 to find out how many boxes are needed, since each box can hold 6 muffins.\n\nThe equation that represents this process is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of boxes} = \\frac{(232 - 190)}{6} \\]\n\nSo, the correct equation is:\n\nA. \\((232 - 190)/6=b\\)"
