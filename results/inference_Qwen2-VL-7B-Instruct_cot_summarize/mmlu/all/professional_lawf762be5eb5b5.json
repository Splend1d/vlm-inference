The man said out loud, \"Oh God, look what that truck driver did. The man driving that truck was racing and going about 100 mph.! Someone call 911!!\" A woman, who was sitting on the beach nearby, but facing the other way, heard the man's outcry. When the case comes to trial, will the court allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances?\n\nA. Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\nB. Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.\nC. No, neither of them can testify because the man was impaired due to being too relaxed from his meditation, and the woman cannot repeat the utterances of an impaired witness.\nD. No, neither can testify because the utterances do not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n"

Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\n\nIn the context of the case, the man's utterances are considered an excited utterance, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. An excited utterance is a statement made by a person while in a state of excitement or fear concerning the event or transaction that is the subject of the statement. This type of statement is admissible in court because it is considered a spontaneous reaction to the event and is therefore reliable.\n\nThe court would likely allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances because they are relevant to the material issue of the case, which is the truck driver's speed and the circumstances surrounding the accident."
