H. when he lost control of the car and jumped a curb, striking a woman who was walking along the sidewalk. As a result of the collision, the woman suffered severe internal injuries and fractured both legs. She was hospitalized for 11 months and became permanently disabled. If the defendant is charged with attempted murder, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts.\nB. guilty, because criminal liability is predicated upon the defendant's willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman.\nD. not guilty, because he lost control of the vehicle.\n"

If the defendant was driving recklessly at a high rate of speed through a residential neighborhood, it can be argued that he was willfully and wantonly disregarding the safety of others. This disregard for safety can be sufficient to establish criminal liability, even if the defendant did not intend to kill the woman."
