On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nMao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA. Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest\nB. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population\nC. Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization\nD. Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population\n"

Mao Zedong's quote discusses the growing polarization in the countryside due to the spontaneous forces of capitalism, the resulting inequality, and the need for a solution that involves socialist transformation and industrialization.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. **Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest**:\n   - This option suggests reforms that aim to reduce social unrest through liberal policies. However, Mao's quote emphasizes socialist transformation and industrialization, which are not typically associated with liberal reforms.\n\nB. **Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population**:\n   - This option aligns closely with Mao's quote. Collectivization of the land is a key aspect of socialist transformation, which is mentioned as a solution to reduce inequality and improve the living standards of peasants.\n\nC. **Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization**:\n   - While industrialization is mentioned in the quote, it is not the primary focus. The quote emphasizes the need for socialist transformation of agriculture and the reduction of inequality, not just industrialization.\n\nD. **Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population**:\n   - This option contradicts the quote. Mao's quote explicitly mentions that capitalist policies will not solve the problem and that the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance is through socialist transformation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct context for Mao Zedong's quotation is:\n\n**B. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population**."
