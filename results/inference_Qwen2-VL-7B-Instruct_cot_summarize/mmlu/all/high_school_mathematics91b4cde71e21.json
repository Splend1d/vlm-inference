This is a cubic equation, and while we can't easily factor it, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to test for possible rational roots. However, without further analysis, we cannot definitively conclude that there are exactly three real solutions without solving the equation explicitly. This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n**B. \\(f(x) \u2265 \u201318\\) for all \\(x \u2265 0\\).**\n\nTo check this, we can evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x = 0\\), which gives us \\(f(0) = -18\\). Since the function is a cubic function, it will eventually increase or decrease beyond this point. Without further analysis, we cannot definitively conclude that \\(f(x) \u2265 \u201318\\) for all \\(x \u2265 0\\). This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n**C. \\(f(x) \u2264 \u201318\\) for all \\(x \u2264 0\\).**\n\nTo check this, we can evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x = 0\\), which gives us \\(f(0) = -18\\). Since the function is a cubic function, it will eventually increase or decrease beyond this point. Without further analysis, we cannot definitively conclude that \\(f(x) \u2264 \u201318\\) for all \\(x \u2264 0\\). This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\n**D. The function \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\(x \u2264 \u20133\\).**\n\nTo check this, we need to find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\) and analyze its sign for \\(x \u2264 \u20133\\). The derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9\\). To determine if \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing, we need to find the critical points by setting \\(f'(x) = 0\\). Solving \\(3x^2 + 4x - 9 = 0\\) gives us the critical points. However, without solving the quadratic equation explicitly, we cannot definitively conclude that \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\(x \u2264 \u20133\\). This statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nNone of the statements are definitively true based on the given information. Further analysis or solving the equation explicitly would be required to determine the correct answer."
