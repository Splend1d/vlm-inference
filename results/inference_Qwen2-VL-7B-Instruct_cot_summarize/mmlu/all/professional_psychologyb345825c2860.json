To reduce this discomfort, they may change their attitudes or behaviors to align with their actions. In this case, participants who were paid $20.00 to lie about the experiment might experience dissonance because they know they are lying, and they might try to justify their actions by liking the experiment more.\n\n**Self-Perception Theory** posits that people infer their attitudes and beliefs from their own behavior. If participants were paid $1.00 to lie, they might infer that they don't like the experiment because they were willing to lie for such a small amount.\n\nGiven these theories, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\n- This option suggests that the $1.00 condition alignss with self-perception theory ( and the $20.00 condition aligns with cognitive dissonance theory. This is incorrect because self-perception theory would predict the opposite.\n\nB. Self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\n- This option suggests that the $1.00 condition aligns with self-perception theory and the $20.00 condition aligns with cognitive dissonance theory.

Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\n- This option suggests that both theories predict the same outcome. This is incorrect because cognitive dissonance theory would predict the opposite.\n\nD. Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $1.00 condition.\n- This option suggest that both theories predict the same outcome.
