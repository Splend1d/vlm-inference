The person walked 3 miles to the east.\n2. Then, the person walked 10 miles to the north.\n3. Next, the person walked 6 miles to the west.\n4. Finally, the person walked 16 miles to the south.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net displacement in the east-west direction and the north-south direction:\n\n- East-West displacement: 3 miles (east - 6 miles west = -3 miles (west)\n- North-South displacement: 10 miles north - 16 miles south = -6 miles (south)\n\nThe negative signs indicate the direction of the displacement, but for the distance, we are interested in the magnitude.\n\nThe distance from the starting point can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the east-west displacement is one leg of the right triangle and the north-south displacement is the other leg. The distance (d) is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-6)^2} \\]\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{9 + 36} \\]\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{45} \\]\n\\[ d \u2248 6.7 \\]\n\nSo, the person is approximately 6.7 miles from the starting point.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 6.7."
