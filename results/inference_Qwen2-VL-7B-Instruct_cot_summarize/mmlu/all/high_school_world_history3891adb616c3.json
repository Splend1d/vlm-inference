Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n"

It focuses on the reaction to British governance and the nature of the massacre itself.\n   \n   - **Option B**: \"can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\"\n     - The passage mentions that the Cawnpore Massacre was a reaction to the British rule, which was characterized by brute force and domination. This and the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. This this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\"\n     - This option aligns well with the passage's emphasis on the reaction to the the British's brutal and oppressive rule.\n\n   - **Option C**: \"should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\"\n     - The passage does not discuss the Cawnpore Massacre as a patriotic act or one that should be praised. It focuses on the reaction to British rule and the nature of the massacre itself.\n\n   - **Option D**: \"seems to have been the product of a well--organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\"\n     - The passage does not mention a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. It focuses on the reaction to British rule and the nature of the massacre itself.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.**"
