This is 10 times the value of the digit 6 in 186,425.\n\nB. 462,017\n- The digit 6 is in the ten thousands place, so its value is 6 * 10,000 = 60,000. This is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in 186,425.\n\nC. 246,412\n- The digit 6 is in the thousands place, so its value is 6 * 1,000 = 6,000. This is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in 186,425.\n\nD. 125,655\n- The digit 6 is in the hundreds place, so its value is 6 * 100 = 600. This is not 10 times the value of the digit 6 in 186,425.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 681,452"
