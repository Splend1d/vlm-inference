This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?\n\nA. The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.\nB. The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.\nC. The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\nD. Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.\n"

The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Contractual Agreement**: The landscaper agreed to maintain the yard for six months for a total fee of $300 per month, totaling $1,800. The homeowner paid for four months, totaling $1,200.\n\n2. **Termination of Contract**: The landscaper was offered a higher-paying job and stopped doing the work, leaving the homeowner with an incomplete yard.\n\n3. **Market Rate**: The homeowner could have hired another landscaper to complete the work at the same rate of $300 per month. This means the homeowner would have paid $300 for each of the remaining two months, totaling $600.\n\n4. **Unjust Enrichment**: The landscaper was enriched by $400 ( ($600 - $200), which is the difference between what the homeowner would have paid for the remaining two months and what the landscaper was already paid for the four months of work.\n\nTherefore, the homeowner is likely to recover $400, which is the unjust enrichment of the landscaper."
