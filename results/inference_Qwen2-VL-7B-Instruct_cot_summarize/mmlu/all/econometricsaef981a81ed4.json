The significance level, often denoted as \u03b1, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It is also the size of the test.\n\n(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test: This statement is incorrect. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It is not equal to the significance level.\n\n(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test: This statement is correct. For a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level, the rejection regions are in the upper and lower 2.5% tails of the distribution.\n\n(iv) 5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test: This statement is incorrect. For a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level, the rejection regions are in the upper and lower 2.5% tails of the distribution, not 5% in each tail."
