The debugger places a breakpoint at the load instruction at virtual address 0x77E81234 in the debugged process P.\n2. The text segment of P begins at 0x77E80000 in P's virtual address space.\n3. The debugger has mapped this same text segment at 0x01000000 in its virtual address space.\n\nTo find the virtual address used by the debugger in its WRITE operation, we need to map the address 0x77E81234 from P's virtual address space to the debugger's virtual address space.\n\nSince the debugger has mapped the text segment of P at 0x01000000, we can calculate the offset of 0x77E81234 from the start of the text segment in P's virtual address space:\n\nOffset = 0x77E81234 - 0x77E80000 = 0x1234\n\nNow, we add this offset to the debugger's mapped address:\n\nVirtual address in debugger's virtual address space = 0x01000000 + 0x1234 = 0x01001234\n\nThe debugger will use this virtual address 0x01001234 for its WRITE operation.\n\nRegarding the access permissions, since the debugger is the one placing the breakpoint, it will have READ/WRITE access to the memory page containing this address. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 0x01001234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access."
