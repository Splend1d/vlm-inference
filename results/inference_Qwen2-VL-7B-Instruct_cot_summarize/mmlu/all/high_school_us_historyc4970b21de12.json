He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of these statements best describes the Emancipation Proclamation?\n\nA. It guaranteed the freedom of all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.\nB. It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.\nC. It declared that the freedom of the slaves was conditional upon the agreement of individual southern states to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government.\nD. It prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement best describes the Emancipation Proclamation, let's analyze each option in the context of the information provided:\n\n1. **Option A:** \"It guaranteed the freedom of all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation did not guarantee the freedom of all slaves at the conclusion of the Civil War. It was a declaration that freed slaves in the rebellious states, not a promise of freedom for all slaves.\n\n2. **Option B:** \"It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.\"\n   - This statement is correct. The Emancipation Proclamation declared that slaves in the states and territories in rebellion against the United States would be freed as of January 1, 1863. It was a military order that applied to the Confederate states.\n\n3. **Option C:** \"It declared that the freedom of the slaves was conditional upon the agreement of individual southern states to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation did not make the freedom of slaves conditional upon a peace treaty. It was a declaration of freedom, not a conditional statement.\n\n4. **Option D:** \"It prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation did not address the use of slaves in combat. It was focused on freeing slaves in the rebellious states, not on the military use of slaves.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement that describes the Emancipation Proclamation is:\n\n**B. It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it it was issued.**"
