The trial court denied the defendant's request and instead instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. After she was convicted by the jury, the defendant claims on appeal that the jury instructions regarding duress violated the due process clause. Were the jury instructions correct?\n\nA. No, because the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements and defenses produced at trial by a defendant.\nB. No, because the jury instruction impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.\nC. No, because the defense of duress is no longer a recognized defense in federal prosecutions, although it was recognized at common law, and is recognized in most state courts.\nD. Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n"

The defense of duress is indeed a recognized defense in many jurisdictions, including federal courts. The prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements of the crime, but the defendant bears the burden of proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. This is a standard that is consistent with the legal principles governing the burden of proof in criminal cases."
