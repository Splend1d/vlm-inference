In this case, the demand is normally distributed with a mean of 2,500 loaves and a standard deviation of 225 loaves. The bakery bakes 3,000 loaves every morning.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score for the supply of bread (3,000 loaves. The z-score is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the supply (3,000 loaves, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean demand (2,500 loaves, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of demand (225 loaves.\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(3,000 - 2,500)}{225} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{500}{225} \\]\n\\[ z = 2.22 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the demand exceeds 3,000 loaves. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the z-score is greater than 2.22. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this probability.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being greater than 2.22 is approximately 0.0132.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today is:\n\nD. 0.0132"
