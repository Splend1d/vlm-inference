As the girl was lying in the street awaiting an ambulance, the driver rushed over to her and said: \"Im terribly sorry. This is the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault. Send me all your hospital bills. I'fl pay for everything. \"When the girl was later released from the hospital, her parents contacted the driver who refused to pay anything. The driver told the girl's mother, \"Since your daughter ran into the street, it was her fault. I have witnesses who saw what she did. If I weren't such a nice guy, I'd sue you for the damage to my new car. \"If the girl's parents, on her behalf, sue the driver in tort, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the driver's post-accident statements?\n\nA.

I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault\" is an admission of negligence. This statement indicates that the driver acknowledges that he was responsible for the accident due to his unfamiliarity with the car, which is a relevant factor in determining negligence.\n\n2. **Statement Regarding Payment of Hospital Bills:**\n   - The driver's statement that \"Send me all your hospital bills. I'll pay for everything\" is an offer to pay for the hospital bills. This statement is not directly related to the driver's negligence but rather an offer to compensate for the damages caused by the accident.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**C. The driver's statement regarding his operation of the car is admissible on the issue of negligence, but his statement concerning payment of of hospital bills is not admissible in accordance with public policy considerations.**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies that the driver's admission of responsibility for the accident ( due to unfamiliarity with the car is relevant to the issue of negligence, while the offer to pay hospital bills is not directly related to the issue of negligence and is more about compensation."
