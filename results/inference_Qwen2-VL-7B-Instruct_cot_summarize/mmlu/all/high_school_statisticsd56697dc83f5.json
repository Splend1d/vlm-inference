No meaningful conclusion is possible without knowing something more about the characteristics of his listeners.\n\nThe survey's results are based on a voluntary response bias, as the respondents chose to send in their e-mails. This means that the sample is not representative of the entire population of listeners. Without knowing more about the characteristics of the listeners who responded, it results cannot be generalized to the entire audience. Therefore, it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions about the opinions of the entire audience based on this survey alone."
