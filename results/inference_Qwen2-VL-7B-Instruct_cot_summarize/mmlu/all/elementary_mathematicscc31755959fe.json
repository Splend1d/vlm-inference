This operation can be used to find the total of a quantity when you have a certain number of groups of another quantity. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points.\n- This option makes sense because it involves multiplying the number of shots (7 by the points per shot (2.\n\nB. The total number of basketballs if 7 basketballs were old and 2 basketballs were new.\n- This option involves addition, not multiplication, as it is adding the number of old basketballs to the number of new basketballs.\n\nC. The total number of points if one player had 7 points and a different player had 2 points.\n- This option involves addition, not multiplication, as it is adding the points of two different players.\n\nD. The total number of basketballs used if there were 7 basketballs and 2 of the basketballs were not used.\n- This option involves subtraction, not multiplication, as it is subtractinging the unused basketballs from the total number of basketballs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points."
