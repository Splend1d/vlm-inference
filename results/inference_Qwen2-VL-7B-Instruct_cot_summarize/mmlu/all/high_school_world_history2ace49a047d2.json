It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles \"Diktat\" is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people. And then this document, with our signature, obtained by force, was proclaimed as a solemn law.\"\nAdolf Hitler, speech to the Reichstag, September 1, 1939\nSource 2:\n\"We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and the oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\"\nWinston Churchill, speech before Parliament, June 4, 1940\nWhat is the historical background for Adolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1?\n\nA.

Hitler also mentions that the Versailles Treaty was unfair to Germany.\n   - **Source 2**: This source is a speech by Winston Churchill, emphasizing the British stance on fighting against the Axis powers, including Germany, during World War II.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - **A. Hitler's belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated**: This This is not directly related to the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles did not involve Poland.\n   - **B. A sense of intolerance of ethnic and political minority groups**: This is not the primary focus of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty was more about territorial and reparations issues.\n   - **C. A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I**: This is directly relevant. The Treaty of Versailles imposed harsh terms on Germany, including territorial losses and reparations, which many Germans felt were unjust.\n   - **D. Hitler's attempted collaboration with Italian leader Benito Mussolini**: This is not the historical background for the condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles. It is more about Hitler's foreign policy actions during World War II.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The historical background for Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles is best described by option C, as it directly addresses the widespread belief in Germany that they had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I.\n\n**Final Answer**: C. A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I"
