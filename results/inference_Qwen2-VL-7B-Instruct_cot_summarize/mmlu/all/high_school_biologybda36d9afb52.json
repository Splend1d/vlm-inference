                    "text": "To determine which inference(s) about the population might be true, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Population Range**: The population was never fewer than 30 squirrels and never more than 45 squirrels.\n2. **Survival Rate**: Half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce.\n3. **Survival to Reproduce**: 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce.\n4. **Population Increase**: The population increased to 80 squirrels.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each inference:\n\n**A. The amount of available food may have increased.**\n- If the amount of available food increased, it would likely lead to a higher survival rate of squirrels born. However, the problem states that only half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, which suggests that the survival rate was relatively low. Therefore, this inference is unlikely to be true.\n\n**B. The number of predators may have decreased.**\n- If the number of predators decreased, it would likely lead to a higher survival rate of squirrels born. However, the problem states that only half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, which suggests that the survival rate was relatively low. Therefore, this inference is unlikely to be true.\n\n**C. The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive.**\n- If squirrels that would not have survived in the past now survive, it means that the genes pool includes individuals that were previously at a disadvantage. This could lead to greater genetic variation in subsequent generations. Therefore, this inference is likely to be true.\n\n**D. A, B, and C**\n- Since inference C is likely to be true, and A and B are unlikely to be true, this option is not entirely accurate.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most accurate inference is **C**. The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive."
