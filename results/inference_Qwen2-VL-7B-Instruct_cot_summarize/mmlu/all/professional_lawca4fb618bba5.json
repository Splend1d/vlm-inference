During the course of the television show, the comedian continually referred to the player as a \"bench warmer. \" Angered by the comedian's insults, the player told him on the telecast, \"Listen, I am a starter, not a bench warmer. \"The football player sued the comedian for slander. At trial, the football player calls a witness who saw the show in question to describe what he had heard on the broadcast. The comedian's attorney objects, claiming that the witness's testimony would be hearsay. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the witness's testimony is not the best evidence.\nB. sustain the objection, because the witness does not have firsthand knowledge whether the comedian was reading from a script.\nC. overrule the objection, because defamatory statements aren't hearsay.\nD. overrule the objection, because the witness is qualified to render a lay opinion as to what he heard.\n"

The witness's testimony, describing what was heard on the broadcast, is relevant to the football player's case and is not hearsay. Hearsay refers to statements made outside of court that are offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, in this case, the witness's testimony is not being offered to prove the truth of the comedian's statements, but rather to describe what was heard on the broadcast. Therefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection."
