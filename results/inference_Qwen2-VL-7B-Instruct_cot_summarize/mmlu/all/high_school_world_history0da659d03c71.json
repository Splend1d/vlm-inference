The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich conclusion is supported by the passage?\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which conclusion is supported by the passage, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. The passage describes a slave trade caravan in Algeria in the 1830s.\n2. The caravan is hunting \"idolatrous Koholanes\" ( (black Africans) and seizing inhabitants, including peasants and slaves.\n3. The prices for different types of slaves are listed, with adult males being the most expensive.\n4. The caravan starts with 64 camels and 16 people, and ends up with 400 slaves, mostly women.\n5. The slaves resist capture and are forcibly taken with the use of whips.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.**\n   - The passage describes the slaves' resistance and the use of force to capture them, indicating that they did not passively accept their enslavement.\n\nB. **North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.**\n   - The passage does not provide information about the captors being rival African tribes. It only describes the capture and enslavement by the caravan.\n\nC. **Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.**\n   - The passage mentions that the caravan ends up with 400 slaves, mostly women, but it does not provide information about the overall population changes in North African tribes.\n\nD. **Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.**\n   - The passage states that adult males are the most expensive, which implies they are highly valued, likely due to their physical strength.\n\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion supported by the passage is:\n\n**D. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.**"
