The z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645 ( (for a two-tailed test).\n\n\\[ \\text{ME} = z \\times \\text{SE} = 1.645 \\times 0.024 \\approx 0.039 \\]\n\nThe confidence interval for the proportion of undecided voters is:\n\\[ \\hat{p} \\pm \\text{ME} = 0.64 \\pm 0.039 \\]\n\nSo, the lower bound of the confidence interval is:\n\\[ 0.64 - 0.039 = 0.601 \\]\n\nAnd the upper bound of the confidence interval is:\n\\[ 0.64 + 0.039 = 0.679 \\]\n\nTherefore, we can be 90.4% sure that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided at that time.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 90.4%"
