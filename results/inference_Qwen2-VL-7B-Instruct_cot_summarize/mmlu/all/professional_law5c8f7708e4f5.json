Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor \u0080\u0094 land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?\n\nA. Fee simple determinable.\nB. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\nC. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\nD. Easement appurtenant.\n"

In this case, the condition is that the property must be used as a country club, with specific amenities and restrictions.\n\n2. **Fee simple subject to condition subsequent** is similar but refers to a condition that must be met at some point in the future, not necessarily immediately. This the condition is that the property must be used as a country club, with specific amenities and restrictions.\n\n3. **Determinable fee subject to an executory interest** is a term that is not commonly used in real estate law. It is not the most appropriate term for this situation.\n\n4. **Easement appurtenant** refers to a right to use another person's land for a specific purpose, such as a right of of way. This is not applicable here as the country club is not using the land for a specific purpose but rather for a specific type of use.\n\nTherefore, the country club's interest in the 50-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company would best be described as a **Fee simple determinable**."
