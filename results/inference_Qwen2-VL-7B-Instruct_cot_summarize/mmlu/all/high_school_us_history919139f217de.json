Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nIn the passage above Coolidge is reacting against which of the following?\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\nC. Populist agitation in the West\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n"

                    "text": "To determine which of the options Coolidge is reacting against, we need to analyze the context and core of his statement. Coolidge is discussing the importance of protecting individual rights, particularly the right to enjoy the rewards of one's own industry and the right to one's's own property. He emphasizes that a government that imposes taxes without necessity or sound public policy is a tyranny and that the breaking down of free government is marked by a disregard for the right of the people to their own property.\n\nGiven this, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\n- Harding's economic policies were generally pro-business and anti-regulation, which might have been seen as a threat to individual rights and property. However, the passage does not specifically mention Harding or his policies.\n\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\n- The Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, and while it could have influenced American politics, the passage does not directly address the growing strength of radical politics.\n\nC. Populist agitation in the West\n- Populism often involves a critique of the economic policies of the elite and a call for greater economic equality. This could be a relevant context, as Coolidge's statement seems to be defending individual rights against what he perceives as an overreach of government power.\n\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n- The Progressive Era ( (1890-1920) focused on reforming, including anti-trust laws, labor rights, and government regulation of of industries. Coolidge's statement seems to be reacting against the idea that government should take too much from individuals, which aligns with the Progressive Era's emphasis on government intervention.\n\nGiven the context and the core of Coolidge's statement, the most fitting answer is:\n\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n\nCoolidge's statement seems to be a reaction against the Progressive Era's emphasis on government intervention and the potential for government to take too much from individuals, which he views as a threat to individual rights and property."
