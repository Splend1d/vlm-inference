In the context of the Department of Health testing the lead levels in the park, a type I error would occur if the park is closed when the lead levels are actually within the allowed limit.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit\n- This would be a type I error because it the park is closed when the lead levels are actually within the allowed limit, it is incorrectly concluding that the park is unsafe when it is actually safe.\n\nB. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit\n- This would be a type II error, also known as a false negative, because it the park is kept open when the lead levels are actually in excess of the allowed limit, it is incorrectly concluding that the park is safe when it is actually unsafe.\n\nC. Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit\n- This would be the correct decision to ensure the safety of children, as it the park is closed when the lead levels are actually in excess of the allowed limit, it is correctly concluding that the park is unsafe.\n\nD. Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit\n- This would be the correct decision to ensure the safety of children, as it the park is kept open when the lead levels are actually within the allowed limit, it is correctly concluding that the park is safe.\n\nTherefore, the decision that would result from the type I error is:\n\nA.
