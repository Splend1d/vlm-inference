This is because the auditor's report may have been issued with an emphasis of\u4e8b\u9879 or an adverse opinion, which could affect the reissuance of the report. The CPA should also consider the reasons for the original opinion and whether there have been any changes in the entity's financial position or operations that could affect the going concern assumption."
