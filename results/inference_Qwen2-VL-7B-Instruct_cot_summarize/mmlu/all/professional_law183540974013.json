Under the proposal, the postal service would be established as a separate state agency under the direction of a postmaster general. The postal service would be responsible for the overnight or express delivery of official governmental mailings within the state. The bill further provides that all state government employees may utilize the overnight postal service at no charge for sending mailings to persons or corporations within the state. Assume that no other state has established such a postal service to date. Moreover, assume there is uncontradicted evidence that the establishment of such an independent state postal service will diminish the revenues of the U. S. Postal Service. Which of the following, if established, is the strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation?\n\nA. Under the Tenth Amendment, a state has exclusive authority to regulate transactions that are wholly intrastate.\nB. Since the proposed bill is not inconsistent with congressional postal power, it is valid under the supremacy clause.\nC. State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.\nD. There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.\n"

While this is true, it does not directly address the specific issue of the postal service's revenues or the efficiency of mail delivery.\n\n2. **Option B: Since the proposed bill is not inconsistent with congressional postal power, it is valid under the supremacy clause.**\n   - This option implies that the proposed bill does not conflict with federal postal regulations. However, it does not directly address the potential diminishment of the U.S. Postal Service's revenues or the the efficiency of mail delivery.\n\n3. **Option C: State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.**\n   - This option suggests that state employees might be exempt from paying for mailing charges, which could be seen as a benefit. However, it does not directly address the potential diminishment of the U.S. Postal Service's revenues or the the efficiency of mail delivery.\n\n4. **Option D: There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.**\n   - This option directly addresses the core issue of the proposed legislation. It suggests that the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously, which is a strong argument in favor of the proposed legislation.\n\nGiven the assumptions and the potential impact on the U.S. Postal Service, the strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation is:\n\n**Option D: There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.**"
