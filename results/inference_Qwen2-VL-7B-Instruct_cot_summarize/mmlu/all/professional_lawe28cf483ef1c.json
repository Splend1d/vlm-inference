One afternoon, a 9-year-old victim was riding her bicycle along the street. As the victim swerved into the southbound lane, her bicycle was struck by a car driven by the defendant. The victim was knocked off her bike and thrown onto the sidewalk adjacent to the street. Although the victim received some minor scrapes and bruises, she was not seriously injured. Following the accident, the car driven by the defendant sped away. Moments later, however, a tractor-trailer crashed into the rear of a car about 30 feet from where the victim was lying. The car almost instantly caught fire as its gas tank exploded. The victim, who was engulfed in the flaming wreckage, was killed. If the defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of the victim, the defendant should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she unlawfully fled the scene of an accident in violation of her statutory duty.\nB. guilty, because her failure to render aid to the victim would make the defendant criminally responsible for the victim's death.\nC. not guilty, because under the circumstances her failure to aid the victim cannot be a basis for imposing criminal responsibility for the victim's death.\nD. not guilty, because there was not a sufficient causal connection between her actions and the victim's death to impose criminal responsibility.\n"

The defendant's failure to remain at the scene of the accident and render aid to the victim does not necessarily establish a causal connection between her actions and the victim's death. The death of the victim was caused by the tractor-trailer crash, not by the defendant's actions. Therefore, the defendant should not be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter."
