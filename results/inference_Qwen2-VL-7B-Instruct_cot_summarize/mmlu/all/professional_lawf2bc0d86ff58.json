Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\nIn the United States, federal courts have jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law, but state courts also also have jurisdiction over such cases. The principle of \"federal question jurisdiction\" allows federal courts to hear cases involving federal law, but it does not mean that state courts must abstain from hearing such cases. The plaintiff has a right to pursue their claim in the state court, and state courts are not required to abstain from hearing cases arising under federal law."
