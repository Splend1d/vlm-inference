The contractor, in turn, hired a subcontractor to dig the hole and plaster the pooi area. After the subcontractor completed his job, the contractor then hired an electrician to install the heater and wiring for the pool. While the electrician was performing his work, the wiring became disjointed and had to be replaced at a substantial expense to the homeowner. If the homeowner sues the electrician in tort to recover the damages she suffered because of this occurrence, will the homeowner prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the wiring became disjointed because the electrician's plans departed from established standards in the electrical industry.\nB. No, unless the electrical wiring that became disjointed was defective.\nC. No, if the electrician used his best professional judgment in performing the electrical work.\nD. No, unless the homeowner knew that the contractor had hired the electrician to perform the electrical work.\n"

This is because the homeowner can argue that the electrician was negligent in not adheringing to industry standards, which led to the damage. \n\nNegligence in tort law generally requires a breach of duty of care and causation. If the electrician's work deviated from industry standards, it can be argued that the electrician breached the duty of care owed to the homeowner. Additionally, if the deviation from standards was the direct cause of the damage, it homeowner can argue that there was causation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, if the wiring became disjointed because the electrician's plans departed from established standards in the electrical industry."
