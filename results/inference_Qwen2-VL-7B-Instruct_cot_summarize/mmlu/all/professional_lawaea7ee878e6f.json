The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. The manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 right away. The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract. Defendant buyer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the statute of frauds was violated in that it was a contract for over $500 that was unenforceable under state law. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\nC. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule.\n"

No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\nThe court is likely to deny the motion to dismiss because the contract involves goods that are specially made for the buyer. Under the law, contracts for the sale of goods that are specially made for a buyer are generally enforceable, even if they are oral. This exception to the statute of frauds allows for the enforcement of such contracts, as it would be impractical to require a written agreement for goods that are custom-made for a specific buyer."
