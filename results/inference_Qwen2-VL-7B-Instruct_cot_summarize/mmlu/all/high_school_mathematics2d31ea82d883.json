The volume \\(V\\) of a solid of revolution can be found using the integral:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} [R(y)]^2 - [r(y)]^2 \\, dy \\]\n\nwhere \\(R(y)\\) is the outer radius and \\(r(y)\\) is the inner radius of the washer at a given \\(y\\)-value. In this case, the outer radius is the distance from the y-axis to the curve \\(y = 2\\), which is simply 2 units. The inner radius is the distance from the y-axis to the curve \\(y = e^x\\), which is \\(e^x \\).\n\nHowever, since we are rotating around the y-axis, we need to express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) for the inner radius. From \\(y = e^x\\), we get \\(x = \\ln(y)\\). Thus, the inner radius \\(r(y)\\) is \\(\\ln(y)\\).\n\nThe volume is then given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\int_{1}^{2} [2]^2 - [\\ln(y)]^2 \\, dy \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi \\int_{1}^{2} 4 - \\ln^2(y) \\, dy \\]\n\nThis integral does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we would typically use numerical methods to approximate the value. However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume we have the correct answer among the choices provided.\n\nGiven the choices:\n\nA. 0.296\nB. 0.592\nC. 2.427\nD. 3.998\n\nWe would need to calculate the integral numerically to find the correct answer. Without the ability to perform the numerical calculation here, I can't directly provide the correct answer. However, if you have access to a calculator or software that can handle numerical integration, you can compute the integral to find the volume.\n\nIf you need further assistance with the calculation or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
