This means we are looking for the z-score that corresponds to the 0.2 quantile in the standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.8 ( (since 1 - 0.2 = 0.8) is approximately 0.84.\n\nNow, we can plug this z-score back into the z-score formula to solve for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ 0.84 = \\frac{(X - 600)}{15} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ 0.84 \\times 15 = X - 600 \\]\n\n\\[ 12.6 = X - 600 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 612.6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value above which 0.2 of a value selected at random from the given normal distribution will be is approximately 612.6.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 612.6"
