The network can carry 1,000 packets per second.\n2. Each packet is 1,000 bytes.\n3. Therefore, the network can carry 1,000 * 1,000 = 1,000,000 bytes per second.\n4. The CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds.\n5. To find the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, we need to consider the time it takes to send one packet and the network's capacity.\n\nThe maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is the network's capacity divided by the time it takes to send one packet.\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Network Capacity}}{\\text{Time to send one packet}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{1,000,000 \\text{ bytes/second}}{10 \\text{ milliseconds}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{1,000,000 \\text{ bytes/second}}{0.01 \\text{ seconds}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = 100,000,000 \\text{ bytes/second} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 100,000 bytes/ second."
