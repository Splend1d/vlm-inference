No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\nC. Yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct.\nD. Yes, because, by accusing the defendant of being a thief, the prosecution has put his character in issue.\n"

This includes evidence of his good character and conduct.
