This occurs when the derivative of the velocity function, which is the acceleration, changes sign.\n\nThe velocity function is given by:\n\nv(t) = t cos(t) - ln(t) + 2\n\nThe acceleration function, a(t), is the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time:\n\na(t) = dv(t)/dt = d/dt [t cos(t) - ln(t) + 2]\n\nUsing the product rule and the chain rule, we get:\n\na(t) = = cos(t) - t sin(t) - 1/t\n\nNow, we need to find the points where the acceleration changes sign. This occurs when the acceleration function equals zero:\n\ncos(t) - t sin(t) - 1/t = 0\n\nThis equation is transcendental and cannot be solved algebraically. However, we can use numerical methods or graphinging to find the approximate solutions. \n\nUsing a numerical method or graph graph, we find that the acceleration changes sign at approximately t = 1.5 and t = 4.5. \n\nTherefore, the object reverses direction twice.\n\nThe correct answer is C. two."
