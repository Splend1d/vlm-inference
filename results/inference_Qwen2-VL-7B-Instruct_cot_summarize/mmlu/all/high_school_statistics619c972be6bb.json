Since the patients are unrelated, we can assume that the side effects in one patient do not affect the side effects in another patient.\n\nThe probability that a single patient will not develop side effects is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\nSince the patients are independent, the probability that all four patients will not develop side effects is the product of the probabilities that each individual patient will not develop side effects:\n\n\\[P(\\text{No side effects in all four}) = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4\\]\n\n\\[P(\\text{No side effects in all four}) = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}\\]\n\n\\[P(\\text{No side effects in all four}) = 0.4096\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.4096"
