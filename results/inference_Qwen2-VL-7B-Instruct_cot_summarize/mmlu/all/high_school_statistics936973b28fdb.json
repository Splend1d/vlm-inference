Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office, and 14 engineers work in the New Orleans office. The business manager decided to use a 2-sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices. Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?\n\nA. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.\nB. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.\nC. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.\nD. No, because the entire population information was used from both offices. Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.\n"

However, in this situation, the manager used the salaries of all the engineers from both offices, which means he used the entire population data rather than a sample. Since the entire population information was used, a t-test is not appropriate because it is designed for sampling purposes. Instead, a different statistical test, such as a paired t-test or a non-parametric test like the Mann-Whitney U test, would be more suitable if the populations are assumed to be normally distributed and have equal variances."
