They found that patients who drank at least three cups of green tea per day had a much lower incidence of depression. In an American newspaper article about this study, which of the following statements should not be made?\n\nA. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have healthier lifestyles than those who don't.\nB. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have a more positive outlook on life than those who don't.\nC. Because this is observational data, the association between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression is not an indication of a causal relationship.\nD. People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n"

It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have healthier lifestyles than those who don't. This statement is reasonable because lifestyle factors can influence both depression and the consumption of green tea.\n- B. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have a more positive outlook on life than those who don't. This is also a plausible explanation, as a positive outlook can influence both depression and the consumption of green tea.\n- C. Because this is observational data, the association between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression is not an indication of a causal relationship. This statement is accurate because observational studies do not establish causation; they only show associations.\n- D. People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis. This statement is problematic because the study does not establish a causal relationship between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression. It only shows an association, and making a recommendation based on this association without further evidence of causation is not scientifically valid.\n\nTherefore, the statement that should not be made is D."
