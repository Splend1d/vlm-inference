The proposed statute's preamble recites that its provisions will ensure: \u0080\u0094 responsible insurance coverage for all those who do business with the state; \u0080\u0094 an increased standard of living for the citizens who comprise the state's labor force; \u0080\u0094 the lowest possible expenditures by the state government; and \u0080\u0094 a beautiful, uniform aesthetic decor for all new state buildings. In evaluating the constitutionality of the state statute under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, which of the following would be most relevant?\n\nA. The number of aliens presently residing in the state.\nB. The necessity for the enactment of this particular statute.\nC. The treaties and immigration laws of the United States.\nD. The overall unemployment rate in the United States.\n"

The treaties and immigration laws of the United States.\n\nThe Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution establishes that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties made under the authority of the United States are the supreme law of the land. Therefore, any state statute that conflicts with federal treaties or immigration laws would be unconstitutional. In this case, the prohibition of nonresident aliens from engaging in state-related business activities could potentially conflict with federal immigration laws, making it a relevant consideration in the evaluation of the statute's constitutionality."
