Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people\u2014these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThrough the remainder of the 1960s, the growth of the organization that published the Port Huron Statement can best be understood in the context of\n\nA. rapid industrialization, urban growth and congestion, and corporate consolidation.\nB. the baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education.\nC. economic polarization, supply-side economic policies, and the disappearance of the middle class.\nD. the proliferation of personal computer technologies, the rise of Christian fundamentalism, and an increase in student apathy.\n"

It outlined the group's beliefs and goals, and it was published by the organization that would later become the Students for a Democratic Society ( (SDS). The SDS was a political organization that was active in the United States from the late 1960s to the early 1970. The organization was founded in 1961 by a group of students who were dissatisfied with the existing political system in the United States. The organization was dissolved in 1971, but its legacy lives on in the form of the New Left movement."
