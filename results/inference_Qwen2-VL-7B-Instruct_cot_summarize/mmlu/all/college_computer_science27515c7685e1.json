Bayes' theorem is given by:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the probability of event A occurring given that B is true.\n- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the probability of event B occurring given that A is true.\n- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of A.\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the prior probability of B.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that the chip came from Company Y given that it is defective. Let's define:\n- \\( A \\) as the event that the chip is from Company Y.\n- \\( B \\) as the event that the chip is defective.\n\nWe need to find \\( P(A|B) \\).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the prior probabilities:\n- \\( P(A) \\) is the probability that the chip is from Company Y. Since there are 9 chips in total and 4 of them are from Company Y, \\( P(A) = \\frac{4}{9} \\).\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability that the chip is defective. There are 3 defective chips in total ( (1 from Company X and 2 from Company Y), so \\( P(B) = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nNext, we calculate \\( P(B|A) \\), the probability that the chip is defective given that it is from Company Y. Since 2 out of the 4 chips from Company Y are defective, \\( P(B|A) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{18}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{4}{18} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chip came from Company Y given that it is defective is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which corresponds to option D."
