Generally, the solubility of an ionic compound in water depends on the charge and size of the ions, as well as the nature of the cation and anion.\n\nHere are the solubility rules for common ions:\n\n1. **Group 1 ( (Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+)**:\n   - Most of these are soluble in water.\n\n2. **Group 2 ( (Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+)**:\n   - Most of these are soluble in water.\n\n3. **Halides ( (Cl-, Br-, I-)**:\n   - Most of these are soluble in water.\n\n4. **Sulfates ( (SO42-)**:\n   - Most of these are soluble in water.\n\n5. **Carbonates ( (CO32-)**:\n   - Most of these are insoluble in water.\n\n6. **Phosphates ( (PO43-)**:\n   - Most of these are insoluble in water.\n\n7. **Selenates ( (SeO42-)**:\n   - Most of these are insoluble in water.\n\n8. **Tellurates ( (TeO43-)**:\n   - Most of these are insoluble in water.\n\n9. **Oxides ( (O2-)**:\n   - Most of these are insoluble in water.\n\n10. **Hydroxides ( (OH-)**:\n    - Most of these are insoluble in water.\n\nGiven these rules, let's analyze the compounds:\n\n- **A. NaBr**: Sodium bromide is soluble in water.\n- **B. NiSO3**: Nickel(II) sulfate is soluble in water.\n- **C. CrCl3**: Chromium(III) chloride is soluble in water.\n- **D. Mn(NO3)2**: Manganese(II) nitrate is soluble in water.\n\nAmong these, **CrCl3** ( Chromium(III) chloride, is the only compound that is not soluble in water according to the solubility rules. Therefore, the compound that is expected to be the least soluble in water is:\n\n**C. CrCl3**"
