                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement carefully:\n\n### Statement 1\nThe VC dimension (Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension) is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm, defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter. For an SVM with a Radial Basis Kernel ( (RBF kernel), the VC dimension is indeed infinite. However, this does not necessarily mean that such an SVM must be worse than an SVM with a polynomial kernel that has a finite VC dimension. The performance of an SVM depends on various factors including the complexity of the decision boundary, the choice of kernel, the regularization parameter, and the dataset. Therefore, the statement is **False**.\n\n### Statement 2\nA two-layer neural network with linear activation functions is essentially a weighted combination of linear separators. This is true because each neuron in the hidden layer of a neural network with linear activation functions can be seen as a linear separator. The output of the network is a weighted sum of these linear separators. The boosting algorithm, which is a method for combining multiple weak learners into a strong learner, can also be seen as a way to find a combination of linear separators. However, the boosting algorithm is not necessarily equivalent to a two-layer neural network with linear activation functions. The boosting algorithm can use different types of weak learners, not just linear separators, and it has its own training process. Therefore, the statement is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
