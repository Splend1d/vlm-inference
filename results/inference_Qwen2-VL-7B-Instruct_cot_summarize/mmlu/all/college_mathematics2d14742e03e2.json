This is because the only rings with exactly two ideals are fields ( or division rings.\n   - In a field, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, which means \\( R \\) is a division ring.\n   - Therefore, \\( R \\) must be commutative since division rings are commutative.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( R \\) is a division ring.**\n   - As discussed, if \\( R \\) has exactly two right ideals, then \\( R \\) must be a division ring.\n   - This statement is true because division rings are characterized by having exactly two ideals.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( R \\) is infinite.**\n   - The number of right ideals in a ring does not necessarily depend on whether the ring is finite or infinite.\n   - For example, the ring of integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) has exactly two ideals ( \\( \\{0 \\mid h \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} \\) and \\( \\{ 0 \\mid h \\ \\mathbb{Z} \\} \\), but \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is infinite.\n   - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and II only**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**D. I and II only**"
