At the time that the crime occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous verdict of all 12 jury members for a conviction on a capital offense. On November 1, the state legislature enacted a new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense. The defendant's trial began on December 1. He was subsequently convicted of murder by an eight- to-four vote. Following the trial, the defendant's attorney filed a motion to set aside the verdict. Which of the following would provide the strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict?\n\nA. The ex post facto clause.\nB. The contracts clause.\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n"

The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from being deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of of law. In this case, the defendant's trial began before the new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense was enacted. Therefore, the defendant was tried under the old law, which required a unanimous verdict. The new law, which was enacted after the defendant's trial began, would not apply retroactively to the defendant's case. Thus, the defendant's trial was conducted under the old law, and the new law cannot be applied to his case. Therefore, the defendant's attorney can argue that the new law violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as it would be an application of a new law to an old case, which is prohibited by the ex post facto clause."
