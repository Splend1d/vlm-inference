Density-dependent regulatory factors are those that control population levels based on the density of the population itself. These factors include competition for resources, predation, and disease.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer is:\n\nB. population levels of a species are kept at equilibrium through natural regulatory mechanisms\n\nThis is because density-dependent factors naturally regulate population levels, and when these factors are disrupted, the population levels may no longer be kept at equilibrium."
