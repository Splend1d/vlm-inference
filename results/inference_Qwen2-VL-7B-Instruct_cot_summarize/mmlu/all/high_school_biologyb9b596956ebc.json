                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Placing the substrate and enzyme in a container with double the capacity.\n\nPlacing the substrate and enzyme in a container with double the capacity would not likely result in a change in the enzyme's efficiency. The efficiency of an enzyme is typically measured by its ability to catalyze a reaction under optimal conditions, which include the right concentration of substrate and enzyme. Increasing the volume of the container would not affect the concentration of the substrate or enzyme relative to each other, thus not impacting the enzyme's efficiency.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options might affect the enzyme's efficiency:\n\nA. Bringing the temperature of the experimental setup from 20\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C: This could change the enzyme's efficiency because enzymes have an optimal temperature range where they function at their highest efficiency. Outside this range, the enzyme's activity can decrease or even denature.\n\nB. Adding an acidic solution to the setup: This could also change the enzyme's efficiency because many enzymes are sensitive to pH changes. Acidic conditions can denature the enzyme, leading to a decrease in its activity.\n\nC. Adding substrate but not enzyme: This would not result in a reaction because there is no enzyme to catalyze the reaction. The efficiency of the enzyme cannot be determined without the enzyme itself.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice as it does not involve altering the concentration of the substrate or enzyme relative to each other, thus not affecting the enzyme's efficiency."
