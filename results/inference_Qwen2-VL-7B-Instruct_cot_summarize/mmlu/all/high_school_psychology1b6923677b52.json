Providing acceleration for gifted students, especially within the areas of their interests and skills\n\nExplanation: Acceleration is a strategy that allows gifted students to progress through the curriculum at a faster pace, often by skipping grades or taking advanced courses. This can help gifted students stay engaged and challenged, and can also help them develop a deeper understanding of their areas of interest and skill. Heterogeneous grouping, independent research projects, and cooperative learning can also be effective strategies, but acceleration is specifically designed to meet the needs of gifted students."
