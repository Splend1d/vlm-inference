She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with \"deviate sexual intercourse\", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n"

The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\n\nReasoninging:\nThe Supreme Court has historically been cautious about state laws that restrict sexual behavior, particularly when those laws target consensual adult behavior. In cases involving similar issues, the Court has often found that such laws violate the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process, which protects individuals from government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberties. This principle is often referred to as the \"right to privacy.\"\n\nIn cases like Lawrence v. Texas ( (2003), the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that criminalized consensual sodomy between adults of the same sex, reasoning that the law violated the right to privacy and the liberty interest of individuals to engage in consensual sexual conduct. The Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas is likely to be a precedent that the Supreme Court would consider in this case, leading to the conclusion that the state law prohibiting consensual sexual relations between two men violates their right to liberty and substantive due process."
