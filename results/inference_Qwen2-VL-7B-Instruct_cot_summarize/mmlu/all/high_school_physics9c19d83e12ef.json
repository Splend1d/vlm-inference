For an incompressible fluid flowing through a horizontal pipe with negligible viscosity, the Bernoulli's equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\) are the pressures at Points 1 and 2, respectively, \\( \\rho \\) is the fluid density, and \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) are the velocities at Points 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nGiven that the flow is streamlined and the flow rate is constant, the volume flow rate \\( Q \\) is constant:\n\n\\[ q = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 V = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d/3}{2}\\right)^2 V' \\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the velocity at Point 1 and \\( V' \\) is the velocity at Point 2. Solving for \\( V' \\):\n\n\\[ V' = \\left(\\frac{d}{d/3}\\right)^2 V = 9V \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( V' \\) into the Bernoulli's equation:\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 = P + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (9V^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P = P_1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 ( (9-1) \\]\n\n\\[ p = p_1 - 4 \\rho V^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure at Point 2 is less than the pressure at Point 1 by \\( 4 \\rho V^2 \\)."
