The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by \u03b1, which is the significance level set by the researchers. In this case, \u03b1 is 0.05.\n\n2. **Type II Error**: This is the error of of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by \u03b2.\n\n3. **Power of the Test**: The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it it is false. It is given by 1 - \u03b2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of increasing the sample size on these errors:\n\n- **Type I Error (\u03b1**: The probability of making a Type I error is determined by the significance level set by the researchers. Increasing the sample size does not affect the probability of a Type I error. Therefore, \u03b1 remains the same.\n\n- **Type II Error \u03b2**: Increasing the sample size generally increase the power of the test. This is because a larger sample size generally provide more information, making it easier to detect a true effect if one exists. As the power of the test increases, the probability of making a Type II error decreases.\n\n- **Power of the Test**: The power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it it is false. Increasing the sample size generally increase the power of the test.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.**"
