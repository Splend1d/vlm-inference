We want to find the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle.\n\nConsider the circle as a unit circle (i.e., the radius is 1. We can assume that the three points are chosen uniformly at random on the circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle formed by the three points. The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, if all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle, then the triangle formed by the three points must be acute.\n\nAn acute triangle is a triangle in which all angles are less than 90 degrees. The probability that a randomly chosen triangle is acute is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the orientation of of the triangle. There are 3! = 6 possible orientations of the triangle. Therefore, the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{C}}$."
