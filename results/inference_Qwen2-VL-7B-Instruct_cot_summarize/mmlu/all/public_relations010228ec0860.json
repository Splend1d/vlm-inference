The activists are waging an intense internet campaign against the practice. Your utility has overwhelming evidence of the health benefits to fluoridated water. The manager of the utility asks you to initiate a blog to get the health message out. What is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA. Use utility employees to write the blog, posing as dentists and physicians.\nB. Recruit a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities with no reference to the utility.\nC. Write the blog yourself, identifying yourself as an employee of the utility, and quote the scientific opinions of a variety of sources.\nD. Compensate a group of dentists and physicians to write the blog, identifying the utility as the sponsor of the blog but without disclosing the compensation.\n"

By identifying yourself as an employee of the utility, you establish your authority and credibility. Additionally, by quoting the scientific opinions of a variety of sources, you provide a balanced and well-rounded perspective on the health benefits of fluoridated water. This approach also also avoids any potential conflicts of interest or appearance of impropriety that could arise from using utility employees to pose as dentists and physicians or compensating dentists and physicians to write the blog."
