Arguing that someone should do something only because of ill will towards someone else: This describes the ad hominem fallacy, where the argument attacks the person rather than addressing the issue.\n\nB. Characterizing an opponent's position in a way that makes it seem ridiculous: This describes the straw man fallacy, where the opponent's position is misrepresented to make it seem ridiculous.\n\nC. Supporting a claim with evidence or reasoning that is not relevant to the proposition, or responding to another's argument by changing the subject: This describes the red herring fallacy, where the argument diverts from the original issue by introducing a new, unrelated topic.\n\nD. Attemptinging to gain agreement based only on the feelings aroused in the message: This describes the appeal to emotion fallacy, where the argument relies on emotional appeal rather than logical reasoning.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Supporting a claim with evidence or reasoning that is not relevant to the proposition, or responding to another's argument by changing the the subject."
