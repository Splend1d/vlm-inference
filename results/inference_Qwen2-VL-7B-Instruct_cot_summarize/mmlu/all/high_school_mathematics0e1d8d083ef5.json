Since a square has four equal sides, let's denote the side length of the square as \\(s\\). Therefore, the perimeter of the square is:\n\\[4s = 24\\]\n\nSolving for \\(s\\), we get:\n\\[s = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\]\n\nNow, to find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is \\(A = s\\). Substituting \\(s = 6\\) into the formula:\n\\[A = 6 \\times 6 = 36\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 36, which corresponds to option C."
