The defendant is alleged to have masterminded a scheme wherein he set up a nonexistent corporation that never conducted business. The victims were sent prospectuses containing false financial data, which induced them to purchase stock in the phony corporation. At trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce into evidence proof that the defendant had set up 10 other so-called dummy corporations that never existed. This evidence is\n\nA. admissible, to show defendant's character trait for dishonesty.\nB. admissible, to show his intent to defraud.\nC. inadmissible, because character cannot be proved by specific instances of misconduct.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is not relevant.\n"

The fact that he set up other dummy corporations demonstrates a pattern of behavior that is relevant to proving his intent to defraud the investors."
