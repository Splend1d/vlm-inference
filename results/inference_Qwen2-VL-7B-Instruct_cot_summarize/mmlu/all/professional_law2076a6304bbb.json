In this context, the state's interest in ensuring that candidates for lieutenant governor have a significant level of support from registered voters is compelling. This interest is related to the state's ability to ensure that candidates have a broad base of support and are not simply the result of a small, possibly unrepresentative, group of voters. Therefore, the requirement for a significant number of signatures serves as a reasonable and necessary means to achieve this compelling state interest."
