Cow's milk\n2. Egg\n3. Fish\n4. Shellfish\n5. Tree nuts ( (e.e., almonds, walnuts, etc.)\n6. Peanut\n7. Soy\n8. Wheat\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Cow's milk, egg\n- Both cow's milk and egg are among the eight major allergens.\n\nB. Mustard seeds, lamb\n- Mustard seeds are not among the eight major allergens triggers. Lamb is not typically listed as a major allergen either, but since mustard seeds are not, this pair is the correct choice.\n\nC. Soy, peanuts\n- Both soy and peanuts are among the eight major allergens.\n\nD. Fish, shellfish\n- Both fish and shellfish are among the eight major allergen triggers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the allergen pair that does not belong to the group of eight major allergens triggers is:\n\nB.
