It is a form of immunity that shields the state or its officials from being sued for damages resulting from their official acts. \n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Functional immunity covers the person but not the act - This is incorrect because functional immunity typically covers the act performed by the state or its officials, not just the person.\n\nB. Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act - This is incorrect because functional immunity is primarily about protecting the act, not the person performing the act.\n\nC. Functional immunity covers the State and incidentally also the act - This is incorrect because functional immunity is about protecting the state from liability, not the act itself.\n\nD. Functional immunity covers both private and public acts as long as they are sanctioned by the State - This is incorrect because functional immunity is specifically about acts performed in an official capacity, not private acts.\n\nThe correct answer is not provided in the options given. Functional immunity typically covers acts performed by the state or its officials in an official capacity, not private acts."
