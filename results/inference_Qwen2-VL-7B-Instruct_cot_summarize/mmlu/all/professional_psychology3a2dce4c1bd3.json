Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with a multifactorial etiology, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The risk of developing schizophrenia is influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors.\n\nResearch suggests that the risk of developing schizophrenia for a first-degree relative ( such as a sibling, of a person with schizophrenia is approximately 10% ( (0.1). This risk is higher than the general population but lower than the risk for identical twins, who have a 42% chance of developing schizophrenia if one twin has the disorder.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.01"
