Since the satellites are identical, their orbital angular momenta per unit mass (\\( a \\)) is the same. Therefore, the angular momentum \\( L \\) is directly proportional to the orbital radius \\( r \\).\n\nGiven that the orbital radius of satellite A (\\( r_A \\)) is twice that of satellite B (\\( r_B \\)), we can write:\n\n\\[ r_A = 2r_B \\]\n\nThe ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{L_A}{L_B} = \\frac{r_A}{r_B} = \\frac{2r_R}{r_R} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2"
