We can use the ideal gas law for each gas and then sum the results. The ideal gas law can also be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{nRT}{V} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{P V}{rt} \\]\n\nFor nitrogen:\n\\[ n_{N_2} = \\frac{P V}{rT} \\]\n\nFor argon:\n\\[ n_{Ar} = \\frac{P V}{rT} \\]\n\nFor water vapor:\n\\[ n_{H_2O} = \\frac{P V}{rT} \\]\n\nThe total number of moles is:\n\\[ n_{total} = n_{N_2} + n_{Ar} + n_{H_2O} \\]\n\nThe partial pressure of nitrogen is:\n\\[ P_{N_2} = \\frac{n_{n_2} P}{n_{total}} \\]\n\nWe need to know the temperature and volume of the container to solve this problem. However, since the question does not provide this information, we can't calculate the exact partial pressure of nitrogen. \n\nGiven the options, we can see that the partial pressure of nitrogen must be less than the total pressure of 2.0 atm, as nitrogen is only one of the three gases in the container. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.33 atm"
