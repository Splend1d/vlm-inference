This alignss with the argument that doctors are qualified to make such decisions.\n\nB. \"Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.\"\n- This statement implies that doctors are accustomed to making life-and-death decisions and that the Oregon physician-assisted law is consistent with their usual practice. It does not directly address the qualification aspect of the argument.\n\nC. \"The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.\"\n- This statement criticizes the argument itself by pointing out that the argument was made by doctors, who are the very group the argument is targeting. It does not directly address the qualification issue.\n\nD. \"The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.\"\n- This statement focuses on the specific requirements of the law, which is about making medical decisions related to life expectancy and prognosis. It does not address the broader issue of whether doctors are qualified to judge the worth of a life.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that best describes Gill's response to the argument is:\n\nA. Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living.\n\nThis option directly addresses the qualification aspect of the argument, aligninging with Gill's stance that doctors are qualified to make decisions about the value of a life."
