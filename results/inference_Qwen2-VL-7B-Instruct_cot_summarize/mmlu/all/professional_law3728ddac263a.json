The consumer did not read the notice and used the machine on a steep hill. As a result, it falls over and crushes him. He sues on a theory of strict liability, alleging a defect in the manufacture of the product. The manufacturer defends that the consumer misused the product. Will the Court likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which the defendant argued renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law?\n\nA. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\nB. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nC. Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.\nD. Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n"

Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n\nIn a products liability case involving strict liability, the plaintiff must prove that the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous. The defendant, in this case, the manufacturer, can raise the defense of contributory negligence if the plaintiff's actions contributed to their own injury. However, contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case. Therefore, the Court is likely to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the fact that the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product."
