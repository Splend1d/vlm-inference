To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?\n\nA. Plan I\nB. Plan II\nC. Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.\nD. Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.\n"

This means that the sample is more representative of the entire student body, which includes students who do not have investments in the stock market.\n- **Plan II** uses a smaller sample (30 students from the subset of 132 students who have investments in the stock market. This means that the sample is more representative of the students who have investments in the stock market.\n\n**Accuracy and Precision:**\n- **Plan I** provides a more accurate estimate of the total investment because it sample is more representative of the entire student body, including students who do not have investments in the stock market.\n- **Plan II** provides a more precise estimate of the total investment for students who have investments in the stock market, but it does not accurately represent the entire student body.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPlan I is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school because it uses a larger and more representative sample of the entire student body.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA.
