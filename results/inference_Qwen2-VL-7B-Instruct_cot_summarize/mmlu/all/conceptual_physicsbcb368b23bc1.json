The net force on the ball is the difference between the force of gravity and any other forces acting on the ball. Since there is no air resistance, the only force acting on the ball is the force of gravity.\n\nAt the 10-m position, the ball is halfway up the height it reached. The force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the object, so the force of gravity on the ball is mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTherefore, the net force on the ball at the 10-m position is mg, which is equal to the force of gravity acting on the ball."
