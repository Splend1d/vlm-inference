When the elevator stopped on the fifth floor, a man entered the elevator smoking a cigar. The man was standing in front of the elderly woman on the elevator when the woman tapped him on the shoulder. When the man turned around, the woman pointed to the \"No Smoking\" sign and said, \"Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting that cigar out?\" The man indignantly responded by inhaling heavily on his cigar, and then he blew a big puff of smoke into the woman's face. When the elevator stopped on the next floor, the man then departed. If the woman brings a civil suit against the man for battery, who will prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because the smoke touched her face.\nB. The woman, because she had a reasonable basis for fearing that the man would attack her.\nC. The man, because he did not touch the woman.\nD. The man, because his conduct was annoying but did not inflict any bodily injury on the woman.\n"

To determine who will prevail, we need to consider the legal definition of battery and the specific circumstances of the incident.\n\nBattery is defined as the unauthorized touching of another person in a way that is offensive or harmful. For a claim of battery to succeed, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's conduct was both unauthorized and offensive or harmful.\n\nHere are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Unauthorized Touching**: The man's conduct involved inhaling and exhaling smoke into the woman's face. This physical contact was unauthorized because the woman did not consent to it.\n\n2. **Offensive or Harmful**: The smoke being blown into the woman's face was offensive and harmful. The woman was clearly disturbed by the man's action, and it can be considered offensive and harmful under the law.\n\nGiven these points, the man's conduct clearly meets the criteria for battery. The woman's claim is supported by the fact that the man's action was both unauthorized and offensive or harmful.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The woman, because the smoke touched her face."
