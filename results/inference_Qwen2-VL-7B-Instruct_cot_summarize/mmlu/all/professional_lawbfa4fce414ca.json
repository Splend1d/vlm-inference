There is a sign warning \"this elevator is not available at this time, please do not ride it.\" A passenger sees the signs, but tries to ride the elevator anyway, and is injured when she falls into the shaft. When the passenger sues the city for negligence, the city states that she assumed the risk. Is that a valid and accurate defense under the circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because she was fully informed and should have known that the elevator was unsafe based upon the signs.\nB. Yes, because the signs make her contributorily negligent and a legal cause of her own injury.\nC. No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.\nD. No, because the city has strict liability when everyone is depending on the subway.\n"

No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.\n\nIn this scenario, the city's defense of \"assumed the risk\" would not be valid because the sign did not adequately inform the passenger of the specific danger she was encountering. The sign merely stated that the elevator was not available, but did not provide any information about the construction or the risk of falling into the shaft. Therefore, the passenger could not have reasonably assumed the risk of injury based on the information provided by the sign."
