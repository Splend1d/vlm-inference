It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage, we need to carefully analyze the information provided and compare it with the characteristics of the Southern Renaissance movements.\n\n1. **Neoplatonism**: This movement is characterized by a revival of interest in the philosophy of Plato, particularly his ideas about the soul and the divine. It often involves a mystical and spiritual approach to understanding the world.\n\n2. **Antitrinitarianism**: This refers to beliefs that challenge the doctrine of the Trinity, which is the belief in the unity of three persons in one God ( Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This.\n\n3. **Pietism**: This is a movement that emphasizes personal piety, a strong sense of personal relationship with God, and a practical, moral approach to Christianity. It.\n\n4. **Rationalism**: This movement emphasizes the use of reason and logic to understand the world and to determine truth, often rejecting traditional religious beliefs in favor of a more scientific and philosophical approach.\n\nNow, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage describes Erasmus as familiarizing a much wider circle with the spirit of antiquity, making classic culture accessible to the educated classes.\n- It mentions that Erasmus wanted to make the classic spirit open to all, not just the few who had previously monopolized it.\n- it also notes that Erasmus aimed to strengthen his argumentation and ornament his style with sentences from antiquity.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that Erasmus was promoting the use of classical knowledge and wisdom to improve one's's writing and argumentation, which aligns with the humanist emphasis on the use of reason and classical learning to improve one's's understanding and expression.\n\nTherefore, the type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to:\n\n**D. Rationalism**"
