Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?\n\nA. For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.\nB. For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.\nC. For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession.\n"

                    "text": "The court is likely to decide in favor of the friend, based on the principle of \"first in possession\" and the recording act of the jurisdiction. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **First in Time vs. First in Possession**: The recording act generally provides that unrecorded conveyances or mortgages of real property are not good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice who first record. However, possession is also a critical factor. The friend took possession of the land after the cousin did not, and thus, the friend is in possession first.\n\n2. **Recording Act**: The recording act states that unrecorded conveyances are not good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice who first record. The cousin, who learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed. However, this does not necessarily mean she is entitled to possession or priority over the friend who was in possession first.\n\n3. **Good Faith Purchaser**: The friend, who knew nothing of the cousin's deed, can be considered a good faith purchaser. The recording act also provides that a subsequent good faith purchaser has priority over a prior donee who fails to record. Since the friend took possession after the cousin did not record her deed, the friend can be considered a good faith purchaser.\n\n4. **Defenses Raised by the Friend**: The friend raised all available defenses, which means he is likely to be able to demonstrate that he is a good faith purchaser and that he took possession in good faith without notice of any prior claims.\n\nGiven these points, the court is likely to decide in favor of the friend, as he was first in possession and can be considered a good faith purchaser under the terms of the recording act.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession."
