The electric field \\( E \\) due to a spherical charge distribution can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\rho(r) \\frac{r^2}{r^2 + x^2} dr \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space, \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the sphere, and \\( x \\) is the distance from the charge distribution to the point where the electric field is being measured.\n\nGiven \\( \\rho = ar \\), we substitute this into the integral:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int ar \\frac{r^2}{r^2 + x^2} dr \\]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts or recognize it as a standard integral form. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can analyze the behavior of the electric field \\( E \\) as \\( r \\) approaches infinity.\n\nAs \\( r \\) approaches infinity, the term \\( \\frac{r^2}{r^2 + y^2} \\) approaches 1, and the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ E \\propto \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int ar dr \\]\n\n\\[ E \\propto \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} ar^2 \\]\n\nThis shows that the electric field \\( E \\) increases linearly with \\( r \\) for \\( r > R \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
