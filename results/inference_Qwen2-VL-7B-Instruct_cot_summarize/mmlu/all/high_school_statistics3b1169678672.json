Let's analyze each option to determine which will result in a smaller margin of error:\n\n1. **A smaller confidence level**: A smaller confidence level means a higher confidence level, which typically results in a wider confidence interval and thus a larger margin of error. Therefore, this option does not result in a smaller margin of error.\n\n2. **A smaller sample standard deviation**: A smaller sample standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, resulting in a more precise estimate. This leads to a narrower confidence interval and a smaller margin of of error. Therefore, this option results in a smaller margin of error.\n\n3. **A smaller sample size**: A smaller sample size generally leads to a wider confidence interval and a larger margin of of error. Therefore, this option does not result in a smaller margin of error.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. II only**"
