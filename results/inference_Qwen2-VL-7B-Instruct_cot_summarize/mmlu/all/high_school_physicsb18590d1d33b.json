After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck?\n\nA. The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.\nB. The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.\nC. The net force is in the positive direction, because the student\u2019s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.\nD. The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n"

The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Motion**: The student pushes the puck from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = 0.2 \\) m. During this time, the net force on the puck is not zero because the student is applying a force to accelerate the puck in the positive direction.\n\n2. **After Lettingting**: Once the student lets go, the puck continues to move across the table. The net force on the puck is zero because the only force acting on the puck is friction, which acts in the negative direction ( opposing the motion. The friction force is equal in magnitude to the force the student applied initially, but in the opposite direction.\n\n3. **Position \\( x = 1.0 \\) m**: At this point, the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down due to friction. The net force is not in the negative direction because the friction force is not in the negative direction; it is in the negative direction, opposing the motion. The net force is not down because the friction force is not downward; it is in the negative direction, opposing the motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct assertion is that the net force is zero, as the student's initial push has been balanced by the friction force acting in the negative direction."
