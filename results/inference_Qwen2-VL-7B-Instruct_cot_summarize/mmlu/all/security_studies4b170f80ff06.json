The end of the Cold War marked a significant shift in the global political landscape, and the role of nuclear deterrence has evolved accordingly. The following options provide different perspectives on the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War:\n\nA. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international and anarchical system may occur.\n\nThis option highlights the concerns about the potential for accidental war and the risks associated with nuclear deterrence. The end of the Cold War has led to a proliferation pessimism, which suggests that the spread of nuclear weapons to non-state actors could lead to an existential threat to the international system. The inability of states to anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international and anarchical system could also lead to normal accidents, which could undermine the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence.\n\nB. Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.\n\nThis option highlights the optimism that nuclear deterrence can prevent war and that the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain. The proliferation optimists argue that the risk of terrorists acquiring the weapon is not yet a reality, and that the ability to retaliate can prevent war.
