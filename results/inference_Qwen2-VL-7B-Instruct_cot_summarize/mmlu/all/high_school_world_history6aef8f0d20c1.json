We need to consider the historical and cultural context of the time when the poet wrote this poem.\n\n1. **Option A: Outmigration from Africa due to political violence**\n   - This option suggests that the poet might have been influenced by the migration of people from Africa to New York due to political violence. However, this does not directly explain why the poet would write lyrically about New York.\n\n2. **Option B: Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas**\n   - This option suggests that there were stronger cultural and artistic influences between Africa and the Americas, which could explain why an African poet would write lyrically about New York. This alignss with the poet's use of vivid imagery and the connection to New York's cultural and artistic significance.\n\n3. **Option C: Preference on the part of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements**\n   - This option suggests that African intellectuals might have preferred Western cultural advancements, which could explain the poet's lyrical style. However, this does not directly explain why the poet would write specifically about New York.\n\n4. **Option D: Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa**\n   - This option suggest that the poet might have been influenced by the lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa. While this might be true, it does not directly explain why the poet would write lyrically about New York.\n\nGiven the analysis, **Option B** best explains the phenomenon of an African poet writing lyrically about New York. The stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas would have allowed the poet to draw on the rich cultural and artistic traditions of New York, leading to the lyrical and vivid imagery in the poem.\n\nFinal answer: **B. Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas**"
