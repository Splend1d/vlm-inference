Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa\nD.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and the core of Rodney's argument. Rodney discusses the impact of the imperialist system on African underdevelopment, emphasizing the role of European capitalists in extending their exploitation from Europe to Africa. He attributes the economic retardation of Africa to the operation of the imperialist system and the actions of those who manipulate or support this system.\n\nNow, let's examine each option in the context of Rodney's argument:\n\nA. **The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers**: This option directly alignss with the period 1450 to 1750 C.E., which is the Age of Exploration and the early stages of European colonization. The colonization of Africa by European powers fits the timeline and the context of Rodney's argument, as it involves the extension of European exploitation and the draining of African wealth.\n\nB. **The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World**: While this is a significant development, it occurs later in the timeline ( during the 17th and 18th centuries, and it is not directly related to the economic retardation of Africa as discussed by Rodney.\n\nC. **The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa**: This development is also significant but not directly related to the economic aspects of underdevelopment that Rodney focuses on. Christianity's spread is more about cultural and religious impact rather than economic exploitation.\n\nD. **The importation of New World products into Africa**: This This is also significant but not directly related to the economic aspects of underdevelopment that Rodney focuses on. The importation of New World products into Africa is more about trade rather than the exploitation and economic retardation of Africa.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that best fits the context and timeline of Rodney's argument is:\n\n**A. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers**"
