                    "text": "To evaluate the hospital officials' claim that chemical waste causes acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, the study needs to establish a control group that is comparable to the exposed group but without the exposure to the chemical waste. The control group should ideally be free from the exposure and the disease being studied (ALL) to provide a baseline for comparison.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Children exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL**\n   - This group is exposed to the chemical waste but does not have the disease. It is not a suitable control group because it is not free from the exposure.\n\nB. **Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL**\n   - This group is not exposed to the chemical waste and does not have the disease. It is a suitable control group because it is free from both exposure and the disease.\n\nC. **Children from the hospital\u2019s outpatient clinic who do not suffer from ALL**\n   - This group is not exposed to the chemical waste but may still be exposed to other factors that could cause leukemia. It is not a suitable control group because it may not be free from other potential exposures.\n\nD. **Children not exposed to the chemical waste who suffer from ALL**\n   - This group is not exposed to the chemical waste but does have the disease. It is not a suitable control group because it is not free from the exposure.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate control group is:\n\n**B. Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL**"
