Increase the concentration of solutes in the cytosol.\nB. Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\nC. Replace phospholipids with glucose molecules.\nD. Exchange phospholipids from one side of the plasma membrane to the other.\n"

Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\n\nExplanation: The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of phospholipids present. Phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails tend to be more rigid and less fluid, while those without double covalent bonds are more fluid. By changing the ratio of these types of phospholipids, the membrane can adapt to different temperatures, maintaining its fluidity and thus its function."
