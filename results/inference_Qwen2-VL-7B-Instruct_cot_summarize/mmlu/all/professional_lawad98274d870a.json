After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?\n\nA. Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.\nB. Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.\nC. Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.\nD. After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.\n"

After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.\n\nThis argument is based on the concept of \"reliance\" and the creation of an option contract. When the owner gave the woman the option to purchase the condo for $100,000, it created an option contract. The woman's expenditure of $10,000 to remodel the kitchen in reliance on the option demonstrates that she was acting in good faith and was detrimentally affected by the owner's subsequent revocation of the option. This reliance is a critical factor in establishing the enforceability of the option contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the owner's revocation would be effective if it was done within a reasonable time after the offer was made, and it does not necessarily mean that the owner's revocation would be ineffective.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the fact that the owner was a merchant does not necessarily mean that the offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months. The revocation of the offer would depend on the terms of the offer and the circumstances of the case.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the fact that the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance does not necessarily mean that the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen. The remodeling of the kitchen could be seen as a separate contract, not necessarily part of the option contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
