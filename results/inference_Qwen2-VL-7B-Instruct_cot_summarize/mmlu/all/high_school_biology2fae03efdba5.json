This suggests that the new variant is likely to be a new species or a new subspecies, as it is not compatible with the original phenotype but can reproduce among itself.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Fallow deer - These are mammals and do not exhibit the same kind of reproductive isolation as ferns.\nB. Fruit flies - These are insects and do not exhibit the same kind of reproductive isolation as ferns.\nC. Grass - Grasses are plants and do not exhibit the same kind of reproductive isolation as ferns.\nD. Spotted toads - These are amphibians and do not exhibit the same kind of reproductive isolation as ferns.\n\nThe most likely answer is:\n\nD. Spotted toads\n\nSpotted toads are amphibians, and amphibians can exhibit reproductive isolation through mechanisms such as hybrid sterility, which is similar to the scenario described with the ferns."
