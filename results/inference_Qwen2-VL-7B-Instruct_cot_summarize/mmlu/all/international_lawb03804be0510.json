In cases of repeated unlawful attacks the UNSC shall authorise neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation.\n\nImplied authorisation refers to the assumption or inference that the United Nations Security Council ( (UNSC) has authorized certain actions or measures, even if it has not explicitly stated so in a resolution. This concept is often used in international law to interpret the intentions of the UNSC when it has not explicitly authorized a particular action. In the context of repeated unlawful attacks, the implied authorisation allows neighboring states to take necessary measures to rectify the situation, provided that the UNSC has not explicitly prohibited such actions."
