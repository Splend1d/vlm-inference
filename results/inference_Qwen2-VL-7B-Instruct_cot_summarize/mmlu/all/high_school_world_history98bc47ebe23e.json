They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nIn addition to the sources of silver mentioned in the first paragraph, the greatest volume of additional silver came to China from which of the following regions?\n\nA. Central Asia\nB. Europe\nC. The Middle East\nD. The New World\n"

It also also mentions that the Portuguese brought silver from India to China. Therefore, the sources of silver mentioned in the passage are Japan and India.\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\n\nA. Central Asia\nB. Europe\nC. The Middle East\nD. The New World\n\nNone of these regions are explicitly mentioned as sources of silver in the passage. The passage only mentions Japan and India as sources of silver.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Europe"
