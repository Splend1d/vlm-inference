The conversion factor is \\( \\pi \\) radians = 180\u00b0.\n\n\\[ \\theta_{\\text{radians}} = \\frac{{30\u00b0 \\times \\pi}{180\u00b0} \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta_{\\text{radians}} = \\frac{30 \\times \\pi}{180} \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta_{\\text{radians}} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the time of flight:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2 \\times 10 \\times \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)}{9.81} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{20 \\times \\frac{1}{2}}{9.81} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{10}{9.81} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 1 \\text{ s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total flight time of the soccer ball is approximately 1 second.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 1 s."
