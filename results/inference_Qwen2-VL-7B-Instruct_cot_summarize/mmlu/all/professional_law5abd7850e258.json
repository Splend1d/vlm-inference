After the husband beat up the wife one night, she decided to kill him. The wife, who was experienced in firearms, planned to shoot her husband while he slept. Before carrying out her plan, the wife took out a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on her husband, naming herself as beneficiary. Shortly thereafter, the husband and wife celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary. They went out to dinner and had a truly enjoyable evening together. After a great night, the wife experienced a change of heart and decided she really loved her husband and didn't want to kill him after all. The wife confessed and told her husband about her plan, begging forgiveness. The husband was outraged. He proceeded to file for divorce and notified the police about his wife's plan. If the wife is charged with attempted murder, she should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she purchased the life insurance policy.\nB. guilty, because she intended to kill her husband.\nC. not guilty, because she did not perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder.\nD. not guilty, because she effectively withdrew from the criminal endeavor.\n"

In this case, the wife took a substantial step towards committing murder by purchasing the life insurance policy and naming herself as the beneficiary. However, she later withdrew from the criminal endeavor by confessinging her plan and begging for forgiveness. This withdrawal from the criminal endeavor can be considered a defense in many jurisdictions, potentially leading to a finding of not guilty."
