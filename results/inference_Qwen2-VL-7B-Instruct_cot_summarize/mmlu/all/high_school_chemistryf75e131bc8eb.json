Electronegativity generally increases from left to right across a period and decreases from top to bottom within a group in the periodic table.\n\nLet's analyze each pair:\n\nA. Oxygen ( (O) and Chromium ( (Cr)\n- Oxygen is in Period 2 and Group 16.\n- Chromium is in Period 4 and Group 6.\n\nOxygen is more electronegative than Chromium.\n\nB. Chlorine ( (Cl) and Iodine ( (I)\n- Chlorine is in Period 3 and Group 17.\n- Iodine is in Period 5 and Group 17.\n\nChlorine is more electronegative than Iodine.\n\nC. Calcium ( (Ca) and Cesium ( (Cs)\n- Calcium is in Period 4 and Group 2.\n- Cesium is in Period 6 and Group 1.\n\nCesium is more electroneegative than Calcium.\n\nD. Sulfur ( (S) and Nitrogen ( (N)\n- Sulfur is in Period 3 and Group 16.\n- Nitrogen is in Period 2 and Group 5.\n\nNitrogen is more electroneegative than Sulfur.\n\nNow, comparing the electronegativities of the second elements in each pair:\n\n- In pair A, the second element ( Chromium ( is less electroneegative than Oxygen.\n- In pair B, the second second element Iodine is less electroneegative than Chlorine.\n- In pair C, the second element Cesium is less electroneegative than Calcium.\n- In pair D, the second element Nitrogen is less electroneegative than Sulfur.\n\nSince we are looking for the pair where the second element has the larger electronegativity, we need to find the pair where the second element is more electroneegative than the first element.\n\nThe pair where the second element has the larger electronegativity is:\n\nB. Chlorine, iodine\n\nChlorine is more electroneegative than Iodine."
