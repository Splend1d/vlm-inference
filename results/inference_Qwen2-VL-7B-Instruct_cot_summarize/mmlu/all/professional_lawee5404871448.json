The prosecution put the witness on the stand at trial to tell what he observed. The defendant's counsel impeached his testimony by bringing up prior inconsistent statements and accusing him of changing his story for trial. The prosecution then attempted to rehabilitate his credibility by referencing prior consistent statements. Prior consistent statements are not generally admissible because they are said to be repetitive, cumulative and to unfairly bolster the witness's credibility. Will the court likely allow the prosecution to rehabilitate the witness using prior consistent statements under these facts?\n\nA. No, because the witness cannot be rehabilitated once a successful impeachment has occurred.\nB. No, because it would tend to confuse the jury with too much conflicting evidence.\nC. Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\nD. Yes, because all repetitive prior statements are important to show the consistency of the witness' testimony.\n"

Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\n\nIn the context of the trial, the prosecution's attempt to rehabilitate the witness's credibility by referencing prior consistent statements is a common and accepted practice. Prior consistent statements are generally admissible to show consistency in a witness's testimony, especially when the witness's credibility has been attacked by the defense. The purpose of such evidence is to demonstrate that the witness has not been inconsistent in their account over time, thereby lending credibility to their current testimony. Therefore, the court is likely to allow the prosecution to use prior consistent statements to rehabilitate the witness's credibility."
