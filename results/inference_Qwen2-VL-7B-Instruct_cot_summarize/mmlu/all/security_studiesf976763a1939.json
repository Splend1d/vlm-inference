This anarchic structure leads to a competitive environment where states are motivated to protect their interests and power. The following statements are consistent with realist views on the likelihood of war:\n\nA. War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.\n- This alignss with the realist view that states act in their own self-interest and that power dynamics influence their behavior.\n\nB. War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\n- Multipolarity can lead to a more competitive environment, where states may feel the need to assert their power and influence, potentially leading to conflict.\n\nC. War is more likely when the offence-defend balance of the international system favours offence, thus creating a more competitive environment for states.\n- A balance that favors offense can create an environment where states feel compelled to act defensively or offensively to maintain their position, increasing the likelihood of conflict.\n\nTherefore, all of these options are true from a realist perspective."
