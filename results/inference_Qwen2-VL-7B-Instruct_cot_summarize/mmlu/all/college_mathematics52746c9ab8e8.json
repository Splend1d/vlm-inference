Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time, we get dV/dt = \u03c0/3 * (2r * dh/dt + \u03c0/3 * r^2 * dr/dt.\nSince the water drips out of the hole at a rate of 3 cm^3 per minute, we have dV/dt = -3 cm^3/min. The radius of the cone is 1 cm, and the height of the cone is 2 cm. Therefore, r = 1 cm and h = 2 cm.\nSubstituting these values into the equation above, we get -3 = \u03c0/3 * 2 * dh/dt + \u03c0/3 * 1^2 * 0 solve for dh/dt, we get dh/dt = -3/(2\u03c0) cm/min.\nWhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone, the height of the water is h = 2 - 0 solve for dh/dt, we get dh/dt = -8/(3\u03c0) cm/min.\nTherefore, the answer is C."
