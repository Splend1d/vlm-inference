A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles\n\nWhen the international demand for Mexican-made textiles decreases, it means that fewer people are willing to buy Mexican-made products. This decrease in demand for Mexican-made products will lead to a decrease in the demand for Mexican pesos, as fewer people will need to exchange their currency to purchase these products. Therefore, the demand curve for the Mexican peso will shift to the left."
