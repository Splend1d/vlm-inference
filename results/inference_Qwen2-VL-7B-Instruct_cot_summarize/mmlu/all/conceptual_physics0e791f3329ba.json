The work done (W is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ W = m \\cdot h \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the crate and \\( h \\) is the vertical distance it is raised.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of of the crate (\\( m \\)) = 100 kg\n- Vertical distance (\\( h \\)) = 2 meters\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\, \\text{kg} \\cdot 2 \\, \\text{m} = 200 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the power ( \\( P \\) required to do this work in a time of 4 seconds. Power is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{W}{t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the work done and \\( t \\) is the time taken.\n\nGiven:\n- Work done (\\( W \\)) = 200 J\n- Time taken (\\( t \\)) = 4 seconds\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{200 \\, \\text{J}}{4 \\, \\text{s}} = 50 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nTherefore, the power required to raise the crate is 500 W.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 500 W"
