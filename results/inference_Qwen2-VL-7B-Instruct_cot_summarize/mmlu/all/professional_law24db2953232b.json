Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.\nC. No, if the tax does not result in a significant collection of revenue.\nD. No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.\n"

No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution's Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms. Congress enacting a tax on the sale of handguns to private individuals, particularly if the intent is to penalize handgun ownership, could be seen as an infringement on this right. Such a tax would likely be challenged as an unconstitutional infringement on the Second Amendment, especially if it is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\n\nTherefore, the tax would likely fail a constitutional challenge if it is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership."
