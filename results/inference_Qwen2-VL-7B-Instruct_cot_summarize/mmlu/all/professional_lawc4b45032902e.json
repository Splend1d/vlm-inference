The fatal wound was inflicted by a single shot, and there was no suggestion of a conspiracy among those present. One of the three men was charged with the killing. The prosecution called one of the other men as its first witness. His testimony, if true, established that the defendant fired the shot that killed the victim. The defendant's attorney then called the man's longtime neighbor to impeach him. Which of the following offers of evidence is most likely to be admitted for the impeachment of the man?\n\nA. Testimony that the witness is a cocaine addict.\nB. Testimony that the witness embezzled money from his employer last year.\nC. Testimony that the witness is not, in the neighbor's opinion, worthy of belief.\nD. Testimony that the witness is an atheist.\n"

Testimony that the witness is a cocaine addict.\n\nImpeachment of a witness is typically based on evidence that directly affects the witness's credibility or reliability. In this context, the neighbor's testimony about the witness being a cocaine addict is relevant because it directly impacts the witness's credibility. Cocaine addiction can affect a person's judgment, reliability, and ability to accurately recall events, which are crucial factors in determining the witness's credibility.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely to be admitted:\n\nB. Testimony that the witness embezzled money from his employer last year.\n- While this information might also be relevant to the witness's character, it does not directly impact the witness's ability to recall or testify accurately about the events in question.\n\nC. Testimony that the witness is not, in the neighbor's opinion, worthy of belief.\n- This is a subjective opinion and does not provide concrete evidence that would affect the witness's credibility.\n\nD. Testimony that the witness is an atheist.\n- This information does not directly impact the witness's ability to recall or testify accurately about the events in question.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate and relevant evidence for impeachment in this scenario is option A."
