Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ 0.80 = e^{-k \\cdot 1} \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.80) = -k \\cdot 1 \\]\n\n\\[ k = -\\frac{\\ln(0.80)}{1} \\]\n\n\\[ k = -\\ln(0.80) \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the time \\( t \\) when 98% of the contaminant is removed, which means 2% remains. So, we have:\n\n\\[ 0.02 = e^{-k \\cdot t} \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) = -k \\cdot t \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( k \\) from the previous calculation:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) = -(-\\ln(0.80)) \\cdot t \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) = \\ln(0.80) \\cdot t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{\\ln(0.80)} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator to find the values:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) \\approx -3.912 \\]\n\\[ \\ln(0.80) \\approx -0.207 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx \\frac{-3.912}{-0.207} \\approx 18.86 \\]\n\nTherefore, the decontamination process will take approximately 18 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 18 min"
