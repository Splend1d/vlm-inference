This means there are 50 choices for the first integer, 49 choices for the second integer, 48 choices for the third integer, 47 choices for the fourth integer, and 46 choices for the fifth integer. So the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers is $50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46$.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits is the number of ways to choose one integer from each of the five tens digit groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69. There are 10 choices for the first integer, 10 choices for the second integer, 10 choices for the third integer, 10 choices for the fourth integer, and 10 choices for the fifth integer. So the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^5$.\n\nThe probability that the 5 integers each have a different tens digit is the number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers. So the probability is $\\frac{10^5}{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46}$.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{1000}{52969}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1000}{52969}}$."
