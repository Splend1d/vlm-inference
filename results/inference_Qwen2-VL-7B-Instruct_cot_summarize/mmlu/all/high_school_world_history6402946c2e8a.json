Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.\nGhana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963\nWhich of the following factors was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which factor was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage, we need to carefully analyze the context and the core message of the passage.\n\nThe passage by Kwame Nkrumah emphasizes the importance of unity and cooperation among African states for effective progress and world peace. He argues that political independence alone is not sufficient to overcome the consequences of colonial rule and that there is a need for union, common purpose, and common planning and effort.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion\n- While differences in ethnicity, language, and religion can create divisions, the passage does not explicitly mention these as the primary barrier to unity. It focuses more on the need for cooperation and common purpose.\n\nB. The spread of communism throughout the continent\n- The passage does not mention communism as a significant factor preventing the fulfillment of political dreams. It is more about the need for unity and cooperation among African states.\n\nC. Armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers\n- The passage does not mention armed intervention by Cold War superpowers as a primary barrier. It focuses more on the internal need for unity and cooperation among African states.\n\nD. Africa's shortage of natural resources\n- The passage does not mention a shortage of natural resources as a significant factor preventing the fulfillment of political dreams. It focuses more on the need for unity and cooperation among African states.\n\nGiven the context and the core message of the passage, the most important factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described is the lack of unity and cooperation among African states.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nA. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion"
