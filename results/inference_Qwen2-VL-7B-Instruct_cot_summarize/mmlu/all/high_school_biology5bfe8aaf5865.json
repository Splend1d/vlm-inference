H+ would increase in the matrix (inside mitochondrial inner membrane).\n\nOligomycin blocks the ATP synthase enzyme, which is responsible for the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. When ATP synthase is blocked, the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is disrupted. As a result, protons (H+) would accumulate inside the matrix (the compartment inside the mitochondrial inner membrane), leading to an increase in the proton concentration in the matrix."
