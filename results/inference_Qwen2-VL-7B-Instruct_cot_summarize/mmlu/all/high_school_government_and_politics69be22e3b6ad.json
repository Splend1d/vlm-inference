State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck a balance between the establishment clause, which prohibits the government from establishing an official religion, and the free-exercise clause, which protects the right of individuals to practice their religion. In the case of prayer during school hours, the Court has ruled that state-sponsored prayer is unconstitutional because it violates the establishment clause. However, voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed because it does not violate the establishment clause."
