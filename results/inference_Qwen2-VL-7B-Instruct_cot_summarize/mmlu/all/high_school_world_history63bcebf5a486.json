That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

The author specifically cites Western Europe's actions, such as brutality and geographical and ecological luck, as examples of how this could be done.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa\n- This option alignss well with the author's assertion. Colonizinging the interior of Africa would involve exploiting the resources and assets of the African continent, which would be a significant step towards achieving global hegemony.\n\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire\n- While this option involves conquering a significant empire, it does not necessarily align with the author's emphasis on exploiting the resources and assets of whole continents. The Aztec Empire was a significant conquest, but it does not directly relate to the exploitation of entire continents.\n\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity\n- This option pertains to a religious movement and does not directly relate to the exploitation of resources, ecosystems, or human assets of continents. It does not support the author's assertion regarding achieving global hegemony through resource exploitation.\n\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan\n- This option involves Japan's isolationist policies, which would not support the author's assertion. Isolationism would hinder rather than facilitate the exploitation of resources and assets of continents, thus not supporting the idea of achieving global hegemony through resource exploitation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that best supports the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. is:\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa"
