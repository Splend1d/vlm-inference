The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?\n\nA. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\nB. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\nD. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n"

No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n\nIn the scenario described, the two cousins took title to real estate as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. This means that upon the death of one joint tenant, the surviving joint tenant(s) automatically become the sole owner of the property. The right of survivorship ensures that the property does not pass through probate and instead passes directly to the surviving joint tenant(s).\n\nWhen the first cousin died, the second cousin became the sole owner of the property due to the right of survivorship. Therefore, the mortgage lien against the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished upon the first cousin's death, as the property had already passed to the second cousin. Consequently, the court would not enforce the lien of the mortgage against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin."
