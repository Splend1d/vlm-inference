Demand for the monopoly firm's output\n\nThe demand curve for a monopoly is likely to be the least elastic because a monopoly has significant market power and can set prices above marginal cost without losing all its customers. This means that the demand for the monopoly's output is relatively insensitive to changes in price. In contrast, the demand curves for perfect competition, oligopoly with a homogenous product, and oligopoly with a differentiated product are more elastic, meaning that changes in price will lead to more significant changes in quantity demanded."
