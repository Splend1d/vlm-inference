                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement in the context of the given information:\n\nA. The densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\n- Density is given by the formula \\( \\rho = \\frac{m}{V} \\), where \\( m = mass \\) and \\( V = volume \\). Since all containers are the same size and at the same temperature, the volume \\( V \\) is constant for all gases. Therefore, the density will be directly proportional to the mass \\( m \\). The masses of the gases are 4.0 g, 28.0 g, and 44.0 g for helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, respectively. Thus, the densities will indeed increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide. This statement is true.\n\nB. The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\n- The number of molecules in a gas is given by \\( N = \\frac{m}{M} \\cdot N_A \\), where \\( m = mass \\), \\( M = molecular \\ mass \\), and \\( N_A = Avogadro's number \\). Since the containers are at the same temperature and pressure, the number of molecules is directly proportional to the mass of the gas. The masses of the gases are 4.0 g, 28.0 g, and 44.0 g for helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, respectively. Therefore, the number of molecules will be in the same order as the masses. This statement is true.\n\nC. The pressure in all three containers is the same.\n- Pressure in a container is given by \\( P = \\frac{mRT}{V} \\), where \\( m = mass \\), \\( r = gas constant \\), \\( T = temperature \\), and \\( V = volume \\). Since the containers are at the same temperature and volume, the pressure will be directly proportional to the mass of the gas. The masses of the gases are 4.0 g, 28.0 g, and 44.0 g for helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, respectively. Therefore, the pressure will be in the same order as the masses. This statement is true.\n\nD. The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\n- The average speed of molecules in a gas is given by \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{8RT}{\\pi M}} \\), where \\( r = gas constant \\), \\( T = temperature \\), and \\( M = molecular \\ mass \\). Since the containers are at the same temperature, the average speed of the molecules will be inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular mass. The molecular masses of helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are approximately 4.00, 28.01, and 44.01 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, the average speed of the molecules will not be the same. This. This. This. This. This. this statement is false.\n\nThe FALSE statement is:\n\nD. The average speed of all the molecules is the same."
