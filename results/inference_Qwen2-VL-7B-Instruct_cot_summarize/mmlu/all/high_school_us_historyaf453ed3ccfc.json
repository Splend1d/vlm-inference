The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance. Should its influence become concentrated, as it may under the operation of such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation. But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it cannot be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence.\"\nPresident Andrew Jackson, Veto of the Bank of the United States, 1832\nWhich of the following events most directly caused the formation of the Second Bank of the United States?\n\nA. The failure of the Specie Circular\nB. Unregulated currency and federal debts after the War of 1812\nC. Efforts by Alexander Hamilton to stabilize the national economy\nD.

The failure of the Specie Circular**\n   - The Specie Circular, issued in 1836, required all federal land sales to be paid in gold or silver. This was a response to the economic instability caused by the Panic of 1837 and the need for a stable currency system. The Specie Circular was not the direct cause of the formation of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\n2. **B. Unregulated currency and federal debts after the War of 1812**\n   - After the War of 1812, the United States faced significant federal debts and a lack of a stable currency system. The need for a central bank to manage these issues and stabilize the economy was a significant factor in the formation of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\n3. **C. Efforts by Alexander Hamilton to stabilize the national economy**\n   - Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, advocated for a central bank to stabilize the national economy. His efforts led to the establishment of the First Bank of the United States in 1791. The Second Bank of the United States was a continuation of this effort, not the direct cause.\n\n4. **D. Federalist counter-reaction to the extreme budget-cutting under Jefferson**\n   - Thomas Jefferson, as President, implemented strict budget-cutting measures, which led to the Federalists Party's push for a stronger central bank to manage the national debt and stabilize the economy. This was a significant factor in the formation of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nGiven the historical context and the need for a central bank to manage the federal debt and stabilize the currency system, the most direct cause of the formation of the Second Bank of the United States is:\n\n**B. Unregulated currency and federal debts after the War of 1812**"
