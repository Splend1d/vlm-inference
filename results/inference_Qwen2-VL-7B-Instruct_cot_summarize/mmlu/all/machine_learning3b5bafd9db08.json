This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem, which relates the prior probability of an event to the likelihood of observing a given outcome.\n\nGiven:\n- P(D) = 0.05 ( (probability of having the disease)\n- P(TP|D) = 0.99 ( (probability of testing positive given that the patient has the disease)\n- P(TN|\u00acD) = 0.97 ( (probability of testing negative given that the patient does not have the disease)\n\nWe need to find P(TP), which is the probability of testing positive regardless of whether the patient has the disease or not. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\n\\[ P(TP) = P(TP|D) \\cdot P(D) + P(TP|\u00acD) \\cdot P(\u00acD) \\]\n\nSince P(TP|\u00acD) is the probability of testing positive given that the patient does not have the disease, we can calculate it as:\n\n\\[ P(TP|\u00acD) = 1 - P(TN|\u00acD) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate P(TP):\n\n\\[ P(TP) = 0.99 \\cdot 0.05 + 0.03 \\cdot 0.95 \\]\n\\[ P(TP) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 \\]\n\\[ P(TP) = 0.078 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.078"
