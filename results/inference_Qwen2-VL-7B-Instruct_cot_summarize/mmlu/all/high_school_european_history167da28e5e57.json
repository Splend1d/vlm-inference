Munich Agreement (1938)\n\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, also known as the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, was signed in 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. It was a non-aggression pact that aimed to prevent war between the two countries and allowed them to divide up Eastern Europe. The Munich Agreement, on the other hand, was a treaty signed in 1938 between Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, which allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. Both agreements were aimed at preventing war and were signed by countries that were later involved in World War II."
