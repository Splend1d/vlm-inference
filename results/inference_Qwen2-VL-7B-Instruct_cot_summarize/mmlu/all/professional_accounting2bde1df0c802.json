Since Toft Co. issued additional shares on April 1, we need to calculate the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year.\n\n- For the first 3 months ( (January to March), the number of shares outstanding is 120,000.\n- For the remaining 9 months ( (April to December), the number of shares outstanding is 160,000 ( (120,000 + 40,000).\n\nThe average number of shares outstanding for the year is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Shares Outstanding} = \\frac{(120,000 \\times 3) + ( (160,000 \\times 9)}{12} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Shares Outstanding} = \\frac{(360,000) + ( (1,440,000)}{12} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Shares Outstanding} = \\frac{1,800,000}{12} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Shares Outstanding} = 150,000 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the preferred dividends:\n\n\\[ \\text{Preferred Dividends} = 100,000 \\times \\$5 = \\$500,000 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the EPS:\n\n\\[ \\text{EPS} = \\frac{\\$480,000 - \\$500,000}{150,000} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{EPS} = \\frac{-\\$20,000}{150,000} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{EPS} = -\\$0.1333 \\]\n\nHowever, earnings per share cannot be negative. It seems there might be a mistake in the calculation or the provided data. The net income should not be negative, and the preferred dividends should not exceed the net income. Let's re-examine the data and calculations:\n\nThe net income is $480,000, and the preferred dividends are $500,000, which is more than the net income. This indicates that the preferred dividends exceed the net income, which is not possible in a typical scenario. \n\nGiven the options provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the data provided. The correct calculation should result in a positive EPS, but with the given data, it's not possible to calculate a positive EPS as the preferred dividends exceed the net income.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data and the options given, none of the options (A, B, C, or D are correct as they do not reflect a realistic scenario where preferred dividends exceed net income."
