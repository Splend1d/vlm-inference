Development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nThe letters from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal and King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo both mention the issue of slavery and the trade of enslaved people. King Afonso I describes how many of his people are seized and sold to the Portuguese, while King Manuel requests that the Portuguese fill their ships with slaves, copper, or ivory to make the expedition worthwhile. These interactions highlight the development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 16th century."
