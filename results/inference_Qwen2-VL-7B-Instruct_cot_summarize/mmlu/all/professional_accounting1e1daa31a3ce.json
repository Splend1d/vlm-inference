Let's correct the approach:\n\nThe correct interpretation is to find the ratio of the market price of Company X to the market price of Company Y, considering the exchange offer. The exchange offer is three-fourths a share of Company X for each share of Company Y. This means for every share of Company Y, you get three-fourths of a share of Company X.\n\nSo, the ratio of the market price of Company X to the market price of Company Y, considering the exchange offer, is:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Market price of Company X}}{\\text{Market price of Company Y}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{45}{30} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = 1.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1.5"
