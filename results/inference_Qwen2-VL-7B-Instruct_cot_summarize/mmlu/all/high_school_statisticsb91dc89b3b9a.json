A matched pairs t-test\n\nThis is because the experiment involves comparing the effectiveness of two treatments (the old formula and the new formula) on the same group of individuals (the volunteers with acne. The response variable is the difference in the number of pimples between the two treatments, which makes it a paired or matched data set. A matched pairs t-test is appropriate for analyzing such data, as it takes into account the correlation between the measurements on the same subjects."
