It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in its core. The rapid rotation of the Earth helps to create the dynamo effect, which is necessary for generating a strong magnetic field. The combination of a partially molten metallic core and a reasonably rapid rotation is what gives Earth its strong magnetic field."
