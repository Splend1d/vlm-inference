By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nC. Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\nD. How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion\n"

                    "text": "To solve this logical reasoning problem, we need to identify the large-scale question about global history that the passage most closely relates to. Let's analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. **How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other**\n   - This option focuses on the exchange of technologies between societies. The passage does not discuss the sharing of technologies between Europe and China. Instead, it contrasts how each region used their resources differently.\n\nB. **Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era**\n   - This option addresses the historical context of European military superiority. The passage explains why Europe and China approached the development of gunpowder weaponry differently, which could be seen as a precursor to their later military superiority. The passage suggests that Europe's focus on gunpowder weapons and China's focus on horse archers might have contributed to this later superiority.\n\nC. **Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.**\n   - This option is about the decline of Silk Road commerce. The passage does not discuss the decline of Silk Road commerce or its causes.\n\nD. **How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion**\n   - This option discusses the impact of climatic conditions on cultural diffusion. The passage does not mention the medieval climatic optimum or its effects on cultural diffusion.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage most closely relates to option B, as it explains the historical context that could lead to European military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\n**Final Answer: B. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era**"
