(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\ni) Maximum likelihood estimation selects the parameter values that maximise the probability that we would have actually observed the values of the series y that we actually did. This is true. Maximum likelihood estimation is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model, given observations. The goal is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.\n\nii) GARCH models can only be estimated by ML and not by OLS. This is false. While GARCH models are often estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, they can also be estimated using other methods such as the method of moments or the conditional least squares.\n\niii) For estimation of a standard linear model ( with no GARCH, the OLS and ML estimates for the slope and intercept parameters will be identical but the estimator for the variance of the disturbances is slightly different. This is true. In a standard linear model, the OLS and ML estimates for the slope and intercept parameters will be identical. However, the estimator for the variance of the disturbances ( the residual variance - will be different.\n\niv) Most computer packages use numerical procedures to estimate GARCH models rather than a set of analytical formula. This is true. Most computer packages use numerical procedures to estimate GARCH models because the likelihood function for GARCH models is not analytically tractable."
