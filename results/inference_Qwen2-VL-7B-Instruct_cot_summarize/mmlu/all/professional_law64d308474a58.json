Unbeknownst to the defendant, the woman had just stolen the briefcase from the man on the street. Believing the woman to be the victim of an attack, the defendant intervened and punched the man until the woman was able to get away with the briefcase. Confused as to why he wasn't being hailed as a hero by the woman, the defendant eventually realized that he had been an unwitting accomplice to the woman's theft. The defendant apologized profusely to the man and went home. According to the alter ego rule, which of the following statements is correct with respect to the amount of force that the defendant was entitled to use in the woman's defense?\n\nA. Since the defendant did not stand in any personal relationship with the woman, he was not justified in using force in her defense.\nB. Not knowing the true facts, the defendant was not justified in using force to protect the woman because the man was privileged to recapture his briefcase.\nC. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since he reasonably believed she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man.\nD. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man was both objectively and subjectively reasonable.\n"

The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man was both objectively and subjectively reasonable.\n\nThe alter ego rule generally that a person who reasonably believes that another is in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm is justified in using reasonable force to protect that person. In this case, the defendant reasonably believed that the woman was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man, and his belief was both objectively and subjectively reasonable. Therefore, the defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense."
