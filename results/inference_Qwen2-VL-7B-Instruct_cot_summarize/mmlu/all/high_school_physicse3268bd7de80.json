This force causes the electron to move in a circular path. The direction of the force is determined by the right-hand rule, which indicates that the electron will move in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from above. The radius of the circular path can be calculated using the formula \\( r = \\frac{mv}{eB} \\), where \\( m \\) is the electron's charge."
