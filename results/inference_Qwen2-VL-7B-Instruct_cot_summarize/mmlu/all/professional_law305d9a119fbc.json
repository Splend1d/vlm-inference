The employee determined that his boss was not breathing, immediately rendered CPR to his boss, and succeeded in reviving him. The employee then called the paramedics, who took the boss to the hospital. Two week later, the boss returned to work. Grateful for the employee's quick action in saving his life, the boss said to the employee, \"You'll have ajob with me for life. \"Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date?\n\nA. &s per the boss's oral promise, the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract.\nB.

Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\n\nExplanation:\n- The employee's act of rendering CPR and saving the boss's life was a gratuitous act ( (i.e., an act performed without expectation of compensation). \n- For a promise to be legally binding, there must be consideration, which is something of value exchanged between the parties. In this case, the employee's act of saving the boss's life was not a form of consideration that would support the boss's promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\n- The boss's oral promise to provide lifetime employment was not supported by sufficient consideration because the employee's act of saving the boss's life was gratuitous and did not constitute a form of consideration that would make the promise legally binding.\n\nTherefore, the correct characterization of the legal relationship is that there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment."
