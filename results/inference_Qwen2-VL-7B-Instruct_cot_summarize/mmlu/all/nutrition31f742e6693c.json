Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it.\n\nAgricultural research that targets poor farmers and consumers is essential for reducing hunger and poverty because it addresses the specific needs and challenges faced by these groups. Such research can lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable farming practices, improved crop yields, and the creation of new, affordable food products. By focusing on these areas, agricultural research can help to increase food security, improve the livelihoods of farmers and consumers, and ultimately reduce poverty. Public investment in this type of research is crucial because it often has little profit potential but provides significant social benefits."
