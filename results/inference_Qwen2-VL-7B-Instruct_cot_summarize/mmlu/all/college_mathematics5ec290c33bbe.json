                    "text": " Let's denote the probability of rolling an odd number as $p$. Then the probability of rolling an even number is $2p$. Since the die has six faces, the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes is 1, so we have the equation $p + 2p = 1$, which simplifies to $3p = 1$. Solving for $p$, we get $p = \\frac{1}{3}$. So the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and the probability of rolling an even number is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the first roll is a 5 and the second roll is a 6. The probability of rolling a 5 is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of rolling a 6 is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities to get the probability of both events happening: $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\nSo the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6 is $\\frac{1}{18}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$."
