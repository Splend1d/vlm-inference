Here, I'll use the prime factorization method for simplicity.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factors of each number:\n\n- The prime factorization of 42 is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n- The prime factorization of 84 is \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\nNow, we look for the common prime factors and their lowest powers in both factorizations:\n\n- Both numbers have 2, 3, and 7 as common prime factors.\n- The lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is \\(2^1\\).\n- The lowest power of 3 in both factorizations is \\(3^1\\).\n- The lowest power of 7 in both factorizations is \\(7^1\\).\n\nMultiplying these together gives us the GCF:\n\n\\[GCF = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42\\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor of 42 and 84 is 42, which corresponds to option C."
