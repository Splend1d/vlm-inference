The loan was secured by a mortgage on the home. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage, which was the only lien on the home at that time. Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother. To accommodate the man's financial situation, the bank extended the amortization period of its loan to substantially reduce the amount of each monthly payment. The bank did not alter the interest rate or increase the principal amount of the loan. At the time of the modification of the bank loan, the man was not in default in his payments to his mother. Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother of the modification of the bank loan. After the man later missed five payments to his mother, she commenced a foreclosure action. While the action was pending, the mother learned of the bank's loan modification. The mother asserted that her mortgage had become a first lien on the home and that the bank's mortgage had become a second lien. Is the mother's assertion correct?\n\nA. No, because the bank's loan modification was not detrimental to the rights of the mother.\nB. No, because the man was not in default in his payments to his mother at the time of the bank's loan modification.\nC. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was made without the mother's prior consent.\nD. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was material.\n"

                    "text": "The mother's assertion that her mortgage became a first lien on the home and that the bank's mortgage became a second lien is correct. This conclusion is based on the principles of lien priority and the doctrine of notice in real estate law.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Lien Priority**: In real estate law, the principle of lien priority generally states that the first recorded lien has priority over subsequent liens. This means that the mother's mortgage, being the first lien recorded, has priority over the bank's mortgage, which was recorded later.\n\n2. **Doctrine of Notice**: The doctrine of notice is a legal principle that states that a person who has notice of a prior lien or encumbrance on property cannot claim a superior interest to that prior lien or encumbrance. In this case, the bank's loan modification was made without informing the mother, and she was not aware of it at the time of the modification. Therefore, the bank's modification did not give the bank notice of the mother's prior lien.\n\nGiven these principles, the mother's assertion is correct because the bank's loan modification was made without her prior consent and without her knowledge, and thus it did not affect the priority of of her lien. The bank's modification was not detrimental to the mother's rights, but it did not change the priority of the liens.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was made without the mother's prior consent."
