This is because operating income is considered to be part of the company's ongoing operations and is not typically subject to extraordinary gains or losses or discontinued operations. Income from continuing operations and extraordinary gains and losses are subject to intraperiod income tax allocation as they are not part of the company's ongoing operations."
