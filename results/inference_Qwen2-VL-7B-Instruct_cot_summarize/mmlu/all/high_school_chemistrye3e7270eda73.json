                    "text": "To determine the pH of the solution made by dissolving 0.0300 mol of sodium ethanoate in enough water to make 50 mL of solution, we need to consider the dissociation of sodium ethanoate in water. Sodium ethanoate, NaC2H3O2, is a salt of a weak acid (ethanoic acid (CH3cooh) and a strong base (NaOH. When dissolved in water, it will dissociate into sodium ions (Na+ and ethanoate ions C2H3O2-.\n\nThe dissociation of sodium ethanoate in water can be represented as:\n\nNaC2H3O2 ( (aq) \u2192 Na+ ( (aq) + C2H3O2- ( (aq)\n\nSince ethanoate ions are the conjugate base of a weak acid, they will react with water to form ethanoic acid and hydroxide ions (OH-:\n\nC2H3O2- ( (aq) + H2O ( (l) \u2192 CH3COOH (aq) + OH- ( (aq)\n\nThe dissociation constant (Ka for ethanoic acid is given as 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5. We can use this information to calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions [OH-] in the solution.\n\nThe dissociation of ethanoic acid can be represented as:\n\nCH3COOH (aq) + H2O ( (l) \u2192 CH3COO- ( (aq) + H3O+ ( (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this dissociation is:\n\nKa = [CH3COO- ][H3O+] / [CH3COOH ]\n\nWe can use the given Ka value and the concentration of ethanoic acid to calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions [OH-]. Since we have 0.0300 mol of sodium ethanoate, the concentration of ethanoic acid is also 0.0300 mol / 0.050 L = 0.600 M.\n\nNow, we can use the Ka expression to solve for [OH-]:\n\n1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 = [OH-] * [H3O+] / 0.600 M\n\nSince [H3O+] = [OH-] in a solution at equilibrium, we can simplify the equation:\n\n1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 = [OH-]^2 / 0.600 M\n\n[OH-]^2 = 1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 * 0.600 M\n\n[OH-] = sqrt(1.8 \u00d7 10^-5 * 0.600 M)\n\n[OH-] \u2248 1.34 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nNow, we can use the concentration of hydroxide ions to calculate the pH of the solution:\n\npOH = -log[OH-]\n\npOH = -log(1.34 \u00d7 10^-3)\n\npOH \u2248 2.86\n\npH = 14 - pOH\n\npH \u2248 14 - 2.86\n\npH \u2248 11.14\n\nThe closest answer to the calculated pH is:\n\nD. 11.02"
