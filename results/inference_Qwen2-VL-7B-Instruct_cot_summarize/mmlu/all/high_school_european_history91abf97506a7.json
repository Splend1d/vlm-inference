So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\n\nA. observation and induction\nB. ancient textual authority\nC. experimentation\nD. deduction from first principles\n"

                    "text": "To determine the basis of Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Observation and Induction**: The passage mentions that the cosmos is spherical because it is the most complete form, the most capacious form, and because all the constituent parts of the universe appear in this form. This suggests that Copernicus is drawing conclusions based on observations and inductive reasoning.\n\n2. **Ancient Textual Authority**: The passage does not rely on ancient texts or authoritative sources. Instead, it is based on the observations and reasoning of Copernicus himself.\n\n3. **Experimentation**: There is no mention of experiments or empirical testing in the passage. The argument is based on theoretical reasoning rather than experimental evidence.\n\n4. **Deduction from First Principles**: While the passage does present a logical argument, it does not explicitly start from first principles. Instead, it is based on observations and inductive reasoning.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. observation and induction"
