A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it.\n\nIn the United States, arrests without a warrant are generally allowed under certain circumstances, including:\n\n- When an officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it ( (Option B).\n- When an officer may arrest for a felony committed in his presence ( (Option C).\n- When an officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in arresting party's presence ( (Option D).\n\nHowever, an officer cannot arrest for a misdemeanor without a warrant unless the officer believes that the person arrested committed the misdemeanor ( (Option A). This belief must be based on reasonable suspicion, not just a hunch or a general belief that a crime has occurred. Therefore, Option A is not one of the circumstances under which an arrest can be made without a warrant."
