He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nWhich best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage?\n\nA. Uneasy allies\nB. Comrades-in-arms\nC. Mortal enemies\nD. Distant strangers\n"

The passage describes a situation where the United States and the Soviet Union are both concerned about the Soviet advance into Korea.\n2. The U.S. military is considering how to establish a surrender zone to prevent the Soviets from seizing all of Korea.\n3. The U.S. military is aware that the Soviets could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive.\n4. The U.S. military is considering using the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line to divide the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\nGiven this context, the relationship between the United States and the Soviets is one of mutual concern and potential conflict, but not necessarily one of open hostility or cooperation. The passage suggests a situation where both sides are aware of each other's intentions and are taking steps to manage the situation, which implies a level of awareness and caution rather than open conflict or cooperation.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage is:\n\nA. Uneasy allies"
