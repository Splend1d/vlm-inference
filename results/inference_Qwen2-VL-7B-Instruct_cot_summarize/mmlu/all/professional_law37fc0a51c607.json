An artist who specialized in making delicate glass sculptures had a studio two blocks away from the laboratory's plant. Late one evening, there was an explosion at the laboratory's plant. The force of the explosion caused the artist's studio to be shaken, which resulted in the destruction of valuable artwork in the studio. The artist now asserts a tort action against the laboratory to recover damages. Which of the following, if established, would furnish the laboratory with its best possible defense?\n\nA. The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.\nB. The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.\nC. The explosion was caused when lightning (an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm.\nD. The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.\n"

The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.\n\nThis defense is the most compelling because it it successfully established, it would demonstrate that the laboratory took all reasonable precautions to prevent the explosion and that any negligence was not the cause of the explosion. This would likely absolve the laboratory of liability for the damages caused by the explosion.\n\nB. The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.\n\nWhile this information might be relevant to the laboratory's operations, it does not directly address the issue of negligence or the cause of the explosion. It does not provide a defense against the artist's claim.\n\nC. The explosion was caused when lightning ( an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm.\n\nThis defense is also relevant, as it would argue that the explosion was caused by an unforeseeable and uncontrollable event ( lightning. However, it does not directly address the issue of negligence or the cause of the explosion.\n\nD. The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.\n\nThis defense would argue that the artist's damages were caused by the artist's own work's fragility, rather than the laboratory's negligence. However, it does not directly address the issue of negligence or the cause of the explosion.\n\nTherefore, the best possible defense for the laboratory would be option A."
