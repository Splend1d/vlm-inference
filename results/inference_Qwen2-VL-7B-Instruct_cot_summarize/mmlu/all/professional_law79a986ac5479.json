The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness \"I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.\nB. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\nC. Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.\nD. Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.\n"

Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.\n\nThe court is likely to sustain the objection because the statement is considered hearsay. Hearsay is a statement made outside the courtroom that is offered in evidence to prove the truth of of the matter asserted. In this case, the statement is being offered to prove that the visitor knew the child and the child's parents had money, which is relevant to the case. However, the statement is also being offered to show the visitor's intent, which is not admissible under the hearsay rule. The statement is also also prejudicial because it it is likely to cause the jury to believe that the visitor is guilty of the crime, even if the evidence does not support that belief."
