This would increase its chances of avoiding detection and thus improve survival.\n\n2. **Selection for nocturnal algae-eater:**\n   - Being active at night can reduce the likelihood of encountering predators like pike-cichhids during their active hunting periods. This would also increase the algae-eater's chances of avoiding predation.\n\n3. **Selection for larger female algae-eater, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young:**\n   - Larger females and larger broods can provide more resources to offspring, potentially increasing their chances of survival and growth. This would enhance reproductive success and population growth.\n\n4. **Selection for algae-eater that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes:**\n   - Becoming sexually mature at a smaller size could allow the algae-eater to reproduce earlier in life, potentially increasing the number of offspring produced over a lifetime. This could also enhance reproductive success.\n\nGiven these considerations, the option that least likely to be observed in the algae-eater population over many generations due to predation pressure from pike-cichhids is:\n\n**C. Selection for larger female algae-eater, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young.**\n\nThis is because larger females and larger broods might be more visible to predators, potentially increasing the risk of predation rather than reducing it. The other options ( drab coloration, nocturnal activity, and smaller sexual maturity age, all involve adaptations that would likely reduce predation risk and enhance survival and reproductive success."
