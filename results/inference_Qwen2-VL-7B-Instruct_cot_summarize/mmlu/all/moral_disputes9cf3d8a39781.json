Genetic diversity is crucial for the resilience of human populations against diseases and environmental changes. Losing this diversity could have severe long-term consequences for human health and adaptability.\n\nB. **The effects of engineering children to have positional goods**: This implies that genetic engineering could be used to create children with certain advantages, such as higher intelligence or physical abilities. This could lead to a new form of social stratification based on genetic traits, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\nC. **Loss of equality of opportunity**: This refers to the potential for genetic engineering to create a scenario where certain traits are more advantageous than others, leading to a situation where individuals are born with certain advantages or disadvantages that affect their opportunities in life. This could undermine the principle of equality of opportunity.\n\nD. **Increased disparity between the rich and the poor**: This option highlights the economic implications of genetic engineering. If genetic enhancements are only available to the wealthy, it could lead to a growing gap between the rich and the poor, further exacerbating existing economic disparities.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Option A** ( \"loss of human diversity\" appears to be the least serious problem according to Singer. While it is a significant concern, it is not as immediately impactful as the other options. The loss of human diversity could have long-term consequences, but it might not be as immediately severe as the other options, which could lead to more immediate and direct social and economic disparities.\n\nTherefore, the least serious problem according to Singer is:\n\n**A. loss of human diversity**."
