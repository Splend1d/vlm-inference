Menopause is a natural biological process that occurs with age.\n\nB. **A smaller proportion of older women report dreams about sex**:\n   - This could be influenced by both age and cohort factors. Dreams about sex might be less common in older age due to natural changes in sexual desire, but it could also be influenced by cohort experiences ( such as cultural attitudes towards sexuality in different generations.\n\nC. **A higher proportion of older men are bald**:\n   - This is an age difference. Hair loss, including baldness, is a natural biological process that occurs with age.\n\nD. **A higher proportion of older men and women are victims of cancer**:\n   - This is an age difference. Cancer risk increases with age due to the accumulation of genetic and environmental factors over time.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B is the most likely to be a cohort difference rather than an age difference. The decrease in dreams about sex in older women could be influenced by cohort experiences, such as cultural attitudes towards sexuality in different generations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. A smaller proportion of older women report dreams about sex**"
