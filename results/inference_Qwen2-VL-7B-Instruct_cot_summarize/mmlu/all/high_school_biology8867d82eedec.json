                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is correct:\n\nA. Water flows from hypertonic to hypotonic.\n- This statement is incorrect. Water flows from a hypotonic solution to a hypertonic solution, not the other way around. This is based on the principle of osmosis.\n\nB. Germinating seeds use less oxygen than do nongerminating seeds.\n- This statement is incorrect. Germinating seeds require more oxygen for respiration to support the metabolic activities associated with germination.\n\nC. The rate of transpiration decreases with an increase in air movement.\n- This statement is incorrect. Transpiration, which is the process of water loss from plants, actually increases with an increase in air movement. Higher air movement can increase the rate of evaporation.\n\nD. Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.\n- This statement is correct. In gel electrophoresis, smaller DNA fragments migrate faster through the gel matrix than larger fragments because they experience less resistance to movement.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis."
