Spencer does not discuss creating a perfect society or advocating for a utopian world. Instead, he focuses on the natural state of human existence and the role of government.\n\n2. **Social Conservatism**: This philosophy emphasizes maintaining the status quo and tradition. Spencer does not discuss maintaining the status quo or tradition. Instead, he discusses the natural state of human existence and the role of government.\n\n3. **Romanticism**: This philosophy emphasizes emotion, individualism, and the importance of the individual over society. Spencer does not discuss the importance of the individual over society. Instead, he discusses the role of government and the natural state of human existence.\n\n4. **Social Darwinism**: This philosophy is based on the theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest. Spencer discusses the survival of the fittest and the role of government in relation to this theory. He suggests that the harsh realities of life, such as poverty and distress, are part of the natural order and are beneficial for the survival of the fittest.\n\nGiven the passage, Spencer's emphasis on the survival of the fittest and the role of government in relation to this theory aligns most closely with Social Darwinism.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nD. Social Darwinism"
