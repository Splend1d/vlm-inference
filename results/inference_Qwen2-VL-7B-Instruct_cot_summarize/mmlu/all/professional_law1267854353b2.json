One year later, the buyer sold the house to a woman for $50,000 more than the buyer had paid, conveying it to the woman by a quitclaim deed. Four months after moving in, the woman discovered a number of latent defects in the foundation that caused the house's basement to take on water during heavy rains. The woman contacted the builder about the problem. Toward the end of their heated conversation, the builder yelled at her, \"So get it fixed!\" After the woman had the foundation repaired by a cement contractor at a cost of $25,000, she successfully sued the builder to recover that amount from him. What is the most likely reason that the woman was successful?\n\nA. The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer.\nB. The court found that by paying the buyer $50,000 more for the house than the buyer had paid the builder, the woman did not get the benefit of her bargain.\nC. The court found that by yelling at the woman to \"get it fixed,\" the builder had committed himself to paying for the repair.\nD. The court found that the defects in the foundation were a breach of the covenant of further assurances in the warranty deed from the builder to the buyer.\n"

The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer.\n\nThis reasoning is based on the concept of implied warranties in real estate transactions. When a builder sells a house to a buyer, they are typically impliedly warranted that the house is habitable and fit for its intended purpose. This warranty extends to subsequent buyers, meaning that if the house later develops defects that make it uninhabitable, the subsequent buyer can sue the original seller for breach of warranty.\n\nIn this case, the defects in the foundation that caused the basement to take on water during heavy rains would likely be considered as a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. The woman, as a subsequent buyer, would have the right to sue the builder for the cost of repairing the foundation, as the defects were present at the time of sale and should have been disclosed or repaired by the builder."
