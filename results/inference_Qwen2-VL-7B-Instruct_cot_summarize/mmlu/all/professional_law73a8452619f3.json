The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The non-profit organization has a \u0080\u0098B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Neither privy of estate nor privy of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Privity of Estate and Privity of Contract:**\n   - **Privity of Estate:** This refers to the direct relationship between the original parties to a lease and the subsequent lessee. It means that the original landlord and the original tenant have a direct relationship, and the landlord can sue the original tenant for breaches of the lease.\n   - **Privity of Contract:** This refers to the direct relationship between the original parties to a contract and the subsequent assignees. It means that the original landlord and the original tenant can sue the assignees for breaches of the lease.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n   - **Option A:** Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper.\n     - This is incorrect because the shopkeeper leased the property to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating, violating the lease agreement. The property owner cannot sue the corporation directly for breaches of the lease.\n\n   - **Option B:** Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation.\n     - This is incorrect because the shopkeeper leased the property to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating, violating the lease agreement. The shopkeeper cannot sue the corporation directly for breaches of the lease.\n\n   - **Option C:** Privity of estate, but not privy of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation.\n     - This is incorrect because the property owner cannot sue the corporation directly for breaches of the lease due to the violation by the shopkeeper.\n\n   - **Option D:** Neither privy of estate nor privy of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.\n     - This is correct because the property owner cannot sue the nonprofit organization directly for breaches of the lease due to the violation by the corporation. The property owner's relationship is with the shopkeeper, not the corporation or the nonprofit organization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
