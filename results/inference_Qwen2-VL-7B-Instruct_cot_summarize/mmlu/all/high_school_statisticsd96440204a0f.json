Here's the analysis of each option:\n\n- **I. There is a strong positive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.**\n  - An R-squared value of 98.1% suggests that the model explains a very high proportion of the variability in the response variable. This high R-squared value typically indicates a strong relationship, but it does not specify the direction of the relationship. Therefore, it is possible that the relationship is positive, but it alone does not confirm this.\n\n- **II. There is a strong negative linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.**\n  - Similarly, a high R-squared value does not provide information about the direction of the relationship. Therefore, it alone does not confirm this.\n\n- **III. About 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.**\n  - This statement is directly supported by the R-squared value of 98.1%. It indicates that the model explains 98.1% of the variability in the response variable.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. I and III only**"
