Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following specific developments contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15?\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which specific development contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, we need to understand the context and core of the question. Federalist #15, written by Alexander Hamilton, discusses the potential for the United States to enter a war with France. The sentiment expressed in the question is about the general sentiment of the time regarding the treatment of African Americans by white people, which is rooted in the idea of slavery and the perception of blacks as property.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n- This event is related to the War of 1812 and the relationship between the United States and Great Britain. It does not directly relate to the sentiment about African Americans.\n\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\n- This event is related to the Florida War (1818-1821 and the relationship between the United States and Spain. It does not directly relate to the sentiment about African Americans.\n\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\n- This event is related to the Indian Wars and the relationship between the United States and Native American tribes. It does not directly relate to the sentiment about African Americans.\n\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n- This event is related to the trade policies of the Dutch East India Company and the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands. It does not directly relate to the sentiment about African Americans.\n\nNone of these events directly relate to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15 about the treatment of African Americans by white people. The sentiment expressed in the question is more about the broader societal attitudes towards African Americans, which were deeply rooted in the institution of slavery and the perception of blacks as property.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the question, none of the provided options directly contribute to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15. However, if we were to choose the option that is least irrelevant, it would be:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n- This event is related to the War of 1812 and the relationship between the United States and Great Britain. It is the least irrelevant option among the provided choices.\n\nTherefore, the best choice, considering the context and the least irrelevant option, is:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region."
