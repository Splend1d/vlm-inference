The water table would be found at an elevation higher than 550 feet above sea level but many feet below the land surface.\n\nThe water table is the level at which the ground is saturated with water. It is typically found at a depth that varies depending on the local geology and topography. In this scenario, since the well penetrates the water table at 550 feet above sea level, it is likely that the water table is deeper than this elevation. Therefore, it would be found at an elevation higher than 550 feet above sea level but many feet below the land surface."
