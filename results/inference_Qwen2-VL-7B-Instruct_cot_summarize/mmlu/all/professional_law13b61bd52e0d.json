The retailer emailed a note back saying \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" No shipment was sent, but four months later when the market demand for widgets skyrocketed, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach claiming that the retailer suffered damages by not having received the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. Does the retailer have a legal right to collect damages under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\nB. No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.\nD. Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n"

Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Specific and Detailed Offer**: The manufacturer's letter clearly stated the terms of the offer: ten truckloads of construction-quality widgets for $1,000 per truck. This is a specific and detailed offer.\n\n2. **Unequivocal Acceptance**: The retailer's email response, \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised,\" was a clear and unequivocal acceptance of the offer. The retailer did not ask for any modifications or changes to the terms of the offer.\n\n3. **Formation of a Contract**: The combination of a specific and detailed offer and an unequivocal acceptance indicates that a contract was formed between the manufacturer and the retailer.\n\n4. **Breach of Contract**: When the manufacturer did not send the widgets, it breached the contract. The retailer was entitled to damages for the breach.\n\n5. **Legal Rights to Collect Damages**: The retailer's lawsuit for breach of contract is based on the fact that the manufacturer did not fulfill its end of the agreement. The retailer suffered damages due to the non-delivery of the widgets, and thus, has a legal right to collect damages.\n\nTherefore, under the given facts, the retailer has a legal right to collect damages under these facts."
