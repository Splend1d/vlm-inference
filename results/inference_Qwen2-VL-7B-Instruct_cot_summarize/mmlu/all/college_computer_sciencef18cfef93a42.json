A set of Boolean operators is complete if it can represent any Boolean expression using only those operators.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. {AND, NOT}\n- With AND and NOT, we can represent any Boolean expression. For example, OR can be represented as \\( A \\land B \\lor A \\land \\neg B \\).\n\nB. {NOT, OR}\n- With NOT and OR, we can represent any Boolean expression. For example, AND can be represented as \\( \\neg A \\lor \\neg B \\lor \\neg A \\lor \\neg B \\).\n\nC. {AND, OR}\n- With AND and OR, we can represent any Boolean expression. For example, NOT can be represented as \\( \\neg A = A \\land \\neg A \\).\n\nD. {NAND}\n- The NAND operator is defined as \\( A \\downarrow B = \\neg ( (A \\land B) \\). With only NAND, we can represent AND, OR, and NOT. For example:\n  - \\( A \\land B = ( (A \\downarrow (B \\downarrow B) \\)\n  - \\( A \\lor B = = ( (A \\downarrow A) \\downarrow (B \\downarrow B) \\)\n  - \\( \\neg A = A \\downarrow A \\)\n\nSince all other operators can be represented using only NAND, {NAND} is complete.\n\nTherefore, the set that is NOT complete is:\n\nC. {AND, OR}"
