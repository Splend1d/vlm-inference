The bar was crowded because a championship boxing match was being shown on the television sets in the bar, and many people had gone to the bar to watch it. During the second round of the boxing match, someone bumped into the customer, causing him to spill a drink on his pants. \"Hey, watch what you're doing, jerk!\" the customer said. The person who had bumped the customer was an employee of the bar hired as a bouncer to deal with unruly customers. Angered by the customer's statement, the employee immediately turned around and punched the customer in the mouth. If the customer asserts a battery claim against the owner of the bar, the customer will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because it was reasonably foreseeable that fights would occur in a crowd of people who were drinking a lot of alcohol.\nB. prevail, because the person who punched the customer was employed as a bouncer.\nC. not prevail, because the owner did not touch the customer.\nD. not prevail, because the owner should not be responsible for the intentional acts of the employee.\n"

Since the employee was hired specifically to deal with unruly customers, the owner would likely be held liable for the employee's actions. However, the customer's claim would depend on whether the owner had knowledge of the employee's actions or if there was a failure to prevent the incident."
