It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\n\nA.

Maize cultivation involves the domestication and cultivation of corn, which is a staple crop in many parts of the world, including Mexico.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux**: This involves hunting a large herbivorous animal, which is quite different from the cultivation of a crop.\n\nB. **Wolf domestication by the Algonquians**: This involves the domestication of a wild animal, which is also different from the cultivation of a crop.\n\nC. **Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois**: This involves a combination of crop cultivation and animal husbandry, which is similar to the practice of cultivating maize in Mexico, as it involves the cultivation of a staple crop.\n\nD. **Seal hunting among the Inuit**: This involves hunting marine mammals, which is different from the cultivation of a crop.\n\nGiven the context, the most analogous practice to maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is:\n\nC. Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois\n\nThis option involves the cultivation of crops, which aligns with the practice of maize cultivation in Mexico."
