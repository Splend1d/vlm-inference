The professor was recently involved in a highly visible political protest against the government. The police eventually shut down the protest because they felt that it was becoming unruly. A television crew covered the entire rally. On the six o'clock news that evening, the film of the protest rally was shown during the broadcast. A news anchorman then made the following commentary: \"It's a shame that public funds are spent to pay the salaries of such university professors, who are not grateful for what this country has done for them. In my opinion, these people like the professor should be deported. \"If the professor asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the television station and the anchorman for his television commentary, the most likely result is that the professor will\n\nA. not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally.\nB. not prevail, because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest.\nC. prevail, because the professor, as a private individual, was placed in a false light.\nD. prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice.\n"

This type of claim is typically based on the unauthorized publication of private information.\n\n2. **Public Interest Exception**: In many jurisdictions, there is a public interest exception to the invasion of privacy claim. This exception allows for the publication of private information if it serves a significant public interest. This is often the case with news reports, as they are considered to serve the public interest by informing the public about events of public concern.\n\n3. **Public Interest in the Case**: The news commentary in question was about a political protest and the professor's involvement in it. This is a matter of public concern, especially if it involves a public figure and a significant political issue. The police action and the protest itself are matters of public interest, and the news coverage of these events is likely to be protected under it serves the public interest.\n\n4. **Legal Precedents**: Courts generally tend to be sympathetic to public interest claims in the context of news reporting. The idea is that the public has a right to know about matters of public concern, and this right often outweighs the privacy rights of individuals involved.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely outcome is that the professor will not prevail because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest."
