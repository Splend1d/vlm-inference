We can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this probability.\n\nFirst, let's standardize the values using the z-score formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value we're interested in, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\mu = 75,000 \\) miles\n- \\( \\sigma = 12,000 \\) miles\n- \\( X = 100,000 \\) miles\n\nFor \\( X = 100,000 \\):\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(100,000 - 75,000)}{12,000} = \\frac{25,000}{12,000} = 2.0833 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. This is equivalent to finding the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven more than 80,000 miles.\n\nSince \\( z = 2.0833 \\) corresponds to the probability of a cab being driven less than 100,000 miles, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this probability.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that:\n\n\\[ P(z = 2.0833) \\approx 0.9812 \\]\n\nThis means that approximately 98.12% of the cabs have been driven less than 100,000 miles.\n\nHowever, we need to find the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. This is the area under to the left of \\( z = 2.0833 \\) in the standard normal distribution, which is approximately 0.9812.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles is approximately 0.9812.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nD. 0.94"
