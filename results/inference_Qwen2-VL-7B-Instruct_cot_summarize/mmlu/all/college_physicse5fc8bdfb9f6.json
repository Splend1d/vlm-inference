Time dilation occurs when two observers moving relative to each other measure different times for the same event. The time dilation factor \\( \\gamma \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the relative velocity between the two observers, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other according to observer O'. This means that the time interval between the flashes as measured by O' is 13 ns, while the time interval between the flashes as measured by O is 0 ns ( (since both sources flash simultaneously for O).\n\nThe time dilation factor \\( \\gamma \\) is related to the time interval \\( \\Delta t \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{\\Delta t_{O'}}{\\Delta t_{O}} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\Delta t_{O'} = 13 \\) ns and \\( \\Delta t_{O} = 0 \\) ns, we can solve for \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{13 \\text{ ns}}{0 \\text{ ns}} \\]\n\nHowever, this equation is undefined because we cannot divide by zero.
