I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals\u2014if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves. But again, I stand on my statement that I think that libertarianism and conservatism are traveling the same path.\"\nRonald Reagan, Interview published in Reason magazine, 1975\nAll of the following are factors that contributed to the prominence of conservatism in the late 1970s and 1980s EXCEPT\n\nA. the success of the Libertarian party in national elections\nB. the growth of religious fundamentalism\nC. perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter\nD. social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War\n"

Let's analyze each option in the context of the information provided:\n\nA. The success of the Libertarian party in national elections\n- The text does not mention the success of the Libertarian party in national elections. It discusses the misnomer of the term \"conservative\" and the relationship between conservatism and libertarianism, but does not mention the Libertarian party's success.\n\nB. The growth of religious fundamentalism\n- The text mentions that the basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or more individual freedom, which alignss with the growth of religious fundamentalism, as it often involves a desire for less government involvement in personal and religious matters.\n\nC. Perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter\n- The text mentions that the basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference, which aligns with the perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter, as these failures could lead to a desire for less government intervention.\n\nD. Social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War\n- The text mentions that the strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood if there is no government to maintain freedom, which aligns with the social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War, as these events could lead to a desire for less government intervention in social matters.\n\nBased on the analysis, the factor that did not contribute to the prominence of conservatism in the late 1970s and 1980s is:\n\nA. the success of of the Libertarian party in national elections"
