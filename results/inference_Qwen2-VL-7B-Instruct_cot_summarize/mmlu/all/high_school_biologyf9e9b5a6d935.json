Let's analyze each option to determine which one does not support this theory:\n\nA. Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission.\n- This supports the theory because it implies that these organelles have their own genetic material and can replicate independently.\n\nB. Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic cells.\n- This supports the theory because it suggests that these organelles retain some characteristics of their prokaryotic ancestors.\n\nC. Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.\n- This contradicts the endosymbiotic theory, which posits that these organelles are integrated into the host cell and do not function independently.\n\nD. Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.\n- This supports the theory because it implies that these organelles retain some characteristics of their prokaryotic ancestors.\n\nTherefore, the option that does not support the endosymbiotic theory is:\n\nC. Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell."
