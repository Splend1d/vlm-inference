There are 3 ways to do this.\nThen, we need to choose 3 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles ( (12 total marbles minus the 3 chosen ones). The number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 9 is $\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!6!} = 84$.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles with exactly one red, green, or blue marble, we multiply the number of ways to choose one of these marbles by the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 marbles: $3 \\times 84 = 252$.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{252}$.
