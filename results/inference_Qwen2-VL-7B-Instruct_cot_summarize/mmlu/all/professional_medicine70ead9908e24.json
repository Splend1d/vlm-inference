Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase\nB. Ca2+ channels\nC. Janus kinase\nD. Serine kinase\n"

Adenylyl cyclase\n\nDesmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin ( also known as antidiuretic hormone ( (ADH). It is used to treat diabetes insipidus and to reduce the frequency of nocturnal enuresis. It works by stimulating the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland, which in turn increases the reabsorption of water by the kidneys, leading to decreased urine output and increased urine osmolality. This effect is mediated by the activation of adenylyl cyclase, which increases the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( (cAMP), leading to the activation of various downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of Ca2+ channels."
