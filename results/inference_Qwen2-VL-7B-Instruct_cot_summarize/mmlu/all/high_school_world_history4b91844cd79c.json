                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to compare the Mongol administration of its Russian domains with the Mongol administration in China as described by Ibn Battuta. Let's analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. **Was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, while the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions**\n   - This option suggests a difference in religious tolerance. The passage mentions that the Mongol administration in China was tolerant of various religious traditions, including Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and others. However, it does not explicitly state that the Mongol administration in Russia was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity. Therefore, this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\nB. **Relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state**\n   - This Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions\n   - This option suggests a difference in administrative structure. The passage does not provide specific details about the administrative structure of the Mongol administration in Russia. However, it does mention that the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state. This implies that the Mongol administration in China was more centralized and bureaucratic compared to the Mongol administration in Russia. Therefore, this option is plausible.\n\nC. **Was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest**\n   - This Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This option suggests a difference in the perception of the administration. The passage does not provide specific details about the perception of the Mongol administration in Russia. However, it does mention that the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest. Therefore, this option is plausible.\n\nD. **Stimulated Russian export of trade goods to China, while the Mongol administration in China intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity**\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n   - This Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest\n"
