Since inventory is an asset, overstating inventory reduces the reported pretax income. We need to subtract the overstated amount from the reported pretax income.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Corrected pretax income} = \\text{Reported pretax income} - \\text{Overstated inventory}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Correct pretax income} = \\$152,500 - \\$30,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Correct pretax income} = \\$122,500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Depreciation expense understated by $64,000**: This means that the reported depreciation expense is lower than it should be. Since depreciation is an expense, understated depreciation increases the reported pretax income. We need to add the understated amount to the reported pretax income.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Correct pretax income} = \\text{Correct pretax income} + \\text{Understated depreciation}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Correct pretax income} = \\$122,500 + \\$64,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Correct pretax income} = \\$186,500\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct pretax income for the year ended December 31 should be:\n\n**C. $186,500**"
