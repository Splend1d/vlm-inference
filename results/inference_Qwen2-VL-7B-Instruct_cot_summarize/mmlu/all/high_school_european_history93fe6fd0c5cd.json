It emphasizes that the society is ripe for change and has long been yearning for it. It also also mentions that any delay in beginning perestroika could lead to serious crises.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was inevitable.\"\n     - The passage does not explicitly state that restructuring was inevitable. It suggests that it was necessary due to the societal readiness for change.\n   - **Option B**: \"A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union would exacerbate the current situation.\"\n     - The passage does not mention that restructuring would exacerbate the current situation. Instead, it suggests that delay would lead to crises.\n   - **Option C**: \"A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis.\"\n     - This option aligns with the passage, which states that any delay in beginning perestroika could lead to serious crises.\n   - **Option D**: \"A restructuring of socialist society was necessary in order to avoid the collapse of the Soviet Union.\"\n     - The passage does not explicitly state that the collapse of the Soviet Union was imminent. It focuses on avoiding crises.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer**: Based on the analysis, the passage clearly indicates that Gorbachev argued that a restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis.\n\n**Final Answer: C. a restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis.**"
