They focus more on the economic and exploitation aspects rather than the diplomatic relations.\n\nB. **Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.**\n   - This option is supported by Source 1, which explicitly states that noblemen and other Kongo's people are taken as slaves by the Portuguese.\n\nC. **Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated.**\n   - Neither letter provides information about the regulation of of trade. The letters focus more on the economic aspects and the need to fill ships with goods.\n\nD. **Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties.**\n   - While Source 2 mentions the need to fill ships with goods, it does not explicitly state that the trade was brisk. The letters do not provide enough information to conclude that the trade was brisk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two letters best support the conclusion that **Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese** ( as explicitly stated in Source 1.\n\n**Final Answer: B. Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.**"
