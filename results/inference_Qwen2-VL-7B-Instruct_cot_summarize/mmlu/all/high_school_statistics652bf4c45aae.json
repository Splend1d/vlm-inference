If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\nC.

                    "text": "The correlation of 0.30 between self-efficacy and job satisfaction indicates a weak positive relationship. This means that as teachers' self-efficacy increases, their job satisfaction tends to increase as well, but the relationship is not very strong.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this information:\n\nA. If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\n- This statement suggests a causal relationship, implying that increasing control over the situation will lead to increased job satisfaction. While the correlation suggests a positive relationship, it does not imply causation. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily supported by the correlation alone.\n\nB. If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\n- This statement is similar to option A. It suggests a causal relationship, which is not supported by the correlation alone. The correlation does not imply causation.\n\nC. Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\n- This statement is the opposite of the correlation. The correlation suggests that as self-efficacy increases, job satisfaction increases. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the correlation.\n\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n- This statement is correct. The correlation coefficient squared ( (r^2) is 0.30^2 = 0.09, which means that 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement that follows from the correlation is:\n\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor."
