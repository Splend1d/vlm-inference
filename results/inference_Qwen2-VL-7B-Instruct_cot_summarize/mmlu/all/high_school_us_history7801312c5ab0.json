                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the context provided by John L. O'Sullivan's statement and then evaluate each option to determine which change in westward migration is most likely to have occurred in the 1840s.\n\nJohn L. O'Sullivan's statement is a vision of the future greatness of the United States, emphasizing its destiny to manifest divine principles and establish a sacred temple on earth. It mentions the westward expansion and the idea of a nation comprising many nations, governed by natural and moral laws.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased.\n- This option suggests a shift in migration patterns, with a decrease in Oregon and an increase in California. This aligns with the historical context of the 1840s, when the Oregon Trail became more popular and the California Gold Rush attracted many settlers.\n\nB. The first great wave of migration ended, and the number of migrants remained extremely low until after the Civil War.\n- This option suggests a significant decline in migration until after the Civil War. However, the statement does not provide information about the end of the first great wave of migration or a significant decline in migration.\n\nC. For the first time, pioneers began to settle area west of the Mississippi River.\n- This option suggests that pioneers began to settle west of the Mississippi River for the first time. However, the statement does not provide information about the first time pioneers settled west of the Mississippi River.\n\nD. Large numbers of free blacks, unwelcome in the East, began to resettle in the West.\n- This option suggests that free blacks began to resettle in the West. However, the statement does not provide information about the migration of free blacks.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the most likely change in westward migration that occurred in the 1840s, as it align with the historical context of the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush.\n\nFinal answer: A. The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased."
