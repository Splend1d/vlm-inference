Which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\nB. The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.\nC. Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\nD. A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\n"

Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\n\nExplanation: The researcher obtained a simple random sample of 30 adults as they leave a Wall Street office building one weekday afternoon. However, all but two of the adults agreed to participate in the survey. This means that the sample is not truly random because it was not possible to obtain a simple random sample of the entire adult population. Instead, the sample was self-selected, which means that the sample is not representative of the entire population. This is an example of selection bias, which can lead to inaccurate results. Therefore, the survey is poorly designed because it was not properly designed to be representative of the entire population."
