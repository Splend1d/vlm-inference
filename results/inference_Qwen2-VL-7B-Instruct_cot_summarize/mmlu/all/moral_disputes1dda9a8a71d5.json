This implies that the absence of a moral principle does not necessarily mean that the behavior is morally permissible or that particularism is true. It simply means that we lack a moral justification for our intuition.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"We know that wasteful drive is morally permissible.\"\n- This option suggests that the absence of a moral principle means that wasteful drive is morally permissible. However, the argument does not support this conclusion. It only states that we lack a moral basis, not that the behavior is permissible.\n\nB. \"We know that particularism is true.\"\n- This option suggests that the absence of a moral principle means that particularism is true. Particularism is a philosophical view that moral judgments are relative to specific situations. While the argument does not directly support particularism, it does not necessarily imply that particularism is true.\n\nC. \"We do not know whether wasteful drive is wrong.\"\n- This option suggests that the absence of a moral principle means that we do not know whether wasteful drive is wrong. This aligns with Sinnott-Armstrong's argument, as it states that the lack of a moral principle means we lack a moral basis to conclude that wasteful drive is wrong.\n\nD. \"We know that wasteful drive is not wrong.\"\n- This option suggest that the absence of a moral principle means that wasteful drive is not wrong. This is not supported by the argument. The argument does not state that wasteful drive is not wrong, only that we lack a moral basis to conclude that it behavior is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. We do not know whether wasteful drive is wrong."
