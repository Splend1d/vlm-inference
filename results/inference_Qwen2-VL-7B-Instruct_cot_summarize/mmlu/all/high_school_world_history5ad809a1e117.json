To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?\n\nA. The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\nB. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\nC. They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.\nD. They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to carefully analyze the tone and context of the first passage by William Bentinck, Governor-General of India, and how it supports the motivations for eradicating the sati ritual.\n\nThe passage by Bentinck discusses the dilemma faced by the British regarding the practice of sati. He acknowledges the responsibility involved in either continuing or discontinuing the practice, emphasizing the horror of consigning innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end. However, he also also mentions the potential danger to the British Empire in India if they were to take a more cautious approach. Bentinck concludes by advocating for an open and general prohibition of sati.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option in the context of the passage:\n\nA. The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\n- The passage does not mention Christianization or any religious motivations. It focuses on the practical and moral implications of continuing or discontinuing the practice.\n\nB. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n- This is a plausible supposition. The passage highlights the moral responsibility of the British to prevent the consignment of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, while also acknowledging the potential danger to their authority if they were to take a more cautious approach.\n\nC. They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.\n- The passage does not explicitly mention a progressive concern for women's equality. It focuses more on the moral and practical implications rather than a specific progressive stance.\n\nD. They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n- The passage does not suggest any racial prejudice or disdain for Indian customs. It is more focused on the moral and practical considerations involved in the decision.\n\nBased on the analysis, the tone of the first passage best supports the supposition that the British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
