The area under the \u03c72 curve is 1.\n- This is true. The \u03c72 distribution is a probability distribution, and the total area under the curve is always 1, representing the total probability.\n\nB. \u03c72 is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable.\n- This is true. The \u03c72 distribution is defined for nonnegative values of the variable, as it is based on the sum of squares of standard normal variables.\n\nC. For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness.\n- This is true. The \u03c72 distribution is positively skewed, and as the degrees of freedom decrease, the skewness becomes more pronounced.\n\nD. For the same \u03b1, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases.\n- This is not true. As the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region actually increases. This is because the \u03c72 distribution becomes more spread out and less skewed as the degrees of freedom increase.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true about the \u03c72 probability distribution function is:\n\nD. For the same \u03b1, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases."
