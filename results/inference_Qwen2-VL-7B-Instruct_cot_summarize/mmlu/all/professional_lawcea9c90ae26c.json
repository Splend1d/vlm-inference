This is because the witness's testimony is relevant to proving the restaurant's negligence in causing the man's frostbite. The fact that the witness also suffered frostbite after spilling a soft drink at the same restaurant two weeks earlier is probative of the restaurant's negligence in causing the man's injury. However, the testimony should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages, as the man's attorney is not seeking to prove the amount of damages he suffered."
