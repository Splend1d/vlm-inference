When a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength of the spectral line is shifted to a shorter wavelength (or blue shift. Conversely, when a star is moving away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted to a longer wavelength ( or red shift. In this case, the observed wavelength is shorter than the laboratory measurement, indicating that the star is moving towards us."
