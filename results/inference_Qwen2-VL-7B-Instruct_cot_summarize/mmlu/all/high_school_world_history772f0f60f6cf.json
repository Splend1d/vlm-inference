                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which of the given developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage, we need to carefully analyze the context and the core message of the passage. Mao's passage discusses the challenges faced by the peasantry in China, particularly the growing polarization between the rich and poor peasants, and the need for socialist transformation to alleviate these issues.\n\nThe second-to-last line of the passage states: \"We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\" This indicates that Mao believes that the only solution to the problems faced by the peasantry is through socialist transformation, which includes the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.\n- This development would likely bring economic growth and potentially alleviate some of the issues faced by the peasantry. It does not undermine Mao's hopes.\n\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.\n- This development would likely lead to a shift in foreign policy and potentially economic policies, but it does not directly address the core issue of the peasantry's economic conditions.\n\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\n- This development would directly undermine Mao's hopes because it would exacerbate the problems of the peasantry, leading to famine and poverty instead of alleviating them.\n\nD. Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution.\n- This development would likely lead to a more centralized and potentially more oppressive regime, which might not be in line with Mao's vision of socialist transformation but does not directly address the economic conditions of the peasantry.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that most undermines the hopes expressed by Mao is:\n\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\n\nFinal answer: C."
