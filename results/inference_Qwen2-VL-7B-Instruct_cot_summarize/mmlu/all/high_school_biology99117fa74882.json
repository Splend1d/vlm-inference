None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nDDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) was initially considered a \"silver bullet\" for pest control because it was highly effective against a wide range of insects. However, over time, many insects developed resistance to DDT, rendering it less effective. This resistance is typically due to genetic changes in the insect population that allow them to survive and reproduce despite the presence of DDT.\n\nFor DDT to be effective in the long run, it would have been necessary to prevent the development of resistance. This could have been achieved by ensuring that none of the individual insects possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT. However, this is not practically feasible, as resistance can develop through natural selection and genetic mutation over time. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
