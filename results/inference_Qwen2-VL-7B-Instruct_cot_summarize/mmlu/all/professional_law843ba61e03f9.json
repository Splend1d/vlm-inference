As a joke, he fired the gun at his wife, wounding her in the shoulder. The husband is later charged with committing a battery upon his wife. If the husband attempts to prove that he was so inebriated he could not have formed a criminal intent, this would constitute a\n\nA. good defense, because the charge requires a specific intent.\nB. good defense, because at least a general criminal intent is required for every offense.\nC. poor defense, because voluntary intoxication is not a valid defense to battery.\nD. poor defense, because the husband was not aware that the gun was loaded.\n"
