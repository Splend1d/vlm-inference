Obtain an understanding of the client's internal control activities.\n\nExplanation: An auditor would most likely perform this procedure before the balance sheet date to assess the effectiveness of the client's internal control activities, which is a key component of the audit process. This understanding helps the auditor in evaluating the risk of material misstatement and planning the audit. Confirmingations with the client's lawyer, determination of liens or encumbrances, and consideration of the client's plans and ability to meet obligations are typically performed after the balance sheet date to ensure that the financial statements reflect the correct financial position and that the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence."
