The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner's offer to pay $5,000 for the replacement of the tiles was a unilateral contract. The homeowner made an offer to the roofer, and the roofer accepted the offer by beginning to perform the work. The fact that the homeowner later decided to repair the roof himself does not negate the initial acceptance of the offer by the roofer. Therefore, the roofer would have a strong case for breach of contract based on the unilateral contract theory."
