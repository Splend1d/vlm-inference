Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nOn which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?\n\nA. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.\nB. Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.\nC. Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.\nD. Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the principal argument of the author in the passage, we need to carefully analyze the context and the core message conveyed. The passage is written by Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, addressing Queen Victoria, and it revolves around the issue of opium trade.\n\n1. **Identify the type of logical reasoning involved:**\n   The passage involves a moral and ethical argument, focusing on the consequences of opium trade and the moral responsibility of the British.\n\n2. **Comprehend the context and the core of the question:**\n   The author argues that the British should not export opium to China because it is harmful and injurious. He cites the British prohibition of opium in their own country as evidence that they recognize its harmful nature. He also questions the British motives for exporting such a harmful substance to China and questions the moral consistency of their actions.\n\n3. **Analyze each option:**\n   - **Option A:** \"It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.\"\n     This option aligns well with the passage. The author argues that the British are being hypocritical by selling opium to China, which they themselves prohibit in their own country. This is a central point in the passage.\n\n   - **Option B:** \"Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.\"\n     While Confucian teachings might be mentioned, they are not the primary focus of the argument. The passage does not rely on Confucian teachings to make its point.\n\n   - **Option C:** \"Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.\"\n     The passage does not focus on the balance of trade but rather on the moral and ethical implications of opium trade.\n\n   - **Option D:** \"Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state.\"\n     This passage does not discuss the risk of military conflict or the wisdom of British actions in terms of military power.\n\n4. **Conclude with a final answer:**\n   The author's primary argument is based on the hypocrisy of selling a harmful substance to China while prohibiting it in their own country. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.**"
