                    "text": "Statement 1 is True. If \\( R \\) is an integral domain, then \\( R[x] \\) ( the ring of polynomials with coefficients in \\( R \\) is also an integral domain. This is because the product of two non-zero polynomials in \\( R[x] \\) is non-zero, and if \\( R \\) is an integral domain, then the product of two non-zero elements in \\( R \\) is non-zero. Therefore, \\( R[x] \\) is also an integral domain.\n\nStatement 2 is False. The degree of the product of two polynomials \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) in \\( R[x] \\) is not necessarily equal to the sum of their individual degrees. The degree of the product \\( f(x)g(x) \\) can be less than the sum of the degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) if the leading coefficients of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) multiply to zero. For example, if \\( f(x) = x \\) and \\( g(x) = -x \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2[x] \\), then \\( f(x)g(x) = -x^2 \\), which has a degree of 2, but \\( \\deg(f(x)) + \\deg(g(x)) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\). However, the degree of the product is not necessarily equal to the sum of the degrees, as the leading coefficients can cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
