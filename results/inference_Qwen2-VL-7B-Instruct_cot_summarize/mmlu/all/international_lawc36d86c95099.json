However, there are specific circumstances under which the ECHR can apply extraterritorially. The correct answer is:\n\nB. The ECHR applies extraterritorially in circumstances where a member State exercises effective control.\n\nThis means that if a member state of the ECHR exercises effective control over a territory outside its own borders, the ECHR can apply to that territory. This is often the case in peacekeeping missions where a member state contributes forces to a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission."
