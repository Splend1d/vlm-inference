                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.\n\nIn the photoelectric effect, the kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of the incident photons minus the work function ( (\u03c6) of the metal. The work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal's surface. This is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ KE = h\u03bd - \u03c6 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( KE \\) is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron,\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant,\n- \\( \u03bd \\) is the frequency of the incident light, and\n- \\( \u03c6 \\) is the work function of the metal.\n\nIncreasing the intensity of the light does not change the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons; it only already exceeds the work function, increasing the intensity will not affect the kinetic energy. However, increasing the intensity will increase the number of photoelectrons produced per second of time, but not the kinetic energy of each electron."
