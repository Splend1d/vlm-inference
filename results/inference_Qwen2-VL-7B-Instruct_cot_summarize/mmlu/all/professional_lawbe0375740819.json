She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?\n\nA. No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.\nB. No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\nC. Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.\nD. Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.\n"

Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.\n\nThe appellate court is likely to reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue. The evidence presented at trial did not provide a clear guarantee or assurance that the plaintiff would have been successful as a professional ballet dancer. The fact that she was considered a bright and uncoming student does not necessarily translate to a guarantee of future success in the highly competitive and demanding field of ballet. The court may find that the evidence did not sufficiently establish the plaintiff's's future earning capacity, making the award of $3 million for lost earning capacity speculative and potentially unjustified."
