The least common denominator (LCD) for 6 and 3 is 6.\n\nSo, we convert 2/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 6:\n\n2/3 = ( (2 * 2) / (3 * 2) = 4/6\n\nNow we can add the two fractions:\n\n5/6 + 4/6 = ( (5 + 4) / 6 = 9/6\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\n9/6 = ( (9 \u00f7 3) / (6 \u00f7 3) = 3/2\n\nSo, the combined width of the two cardboard strips is 3/2 ft, which is equivalent to 1 and 1/2 ft.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1 and 1 over 2 ft"
