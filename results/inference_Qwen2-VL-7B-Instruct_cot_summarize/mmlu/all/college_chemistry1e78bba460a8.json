Signal averaging: This technique involves averaging multiple measurements of the same quantity. By doing so, it reduces the impact of random errors because random errors tend to cancel each other out when averaged. This is a common method used to improve the precision of measurements.\n\n ii. Use of internal standards: Internal standards are used to correct for variations in the sample preparation or measurement process. They provide a reference point that helps to normalize the data, thereby reducing the influence of systematic errors rather than random errors.\n\n iii. Averaging the results from multiple samples: This is essentially the same as signal averaging, where multiple measurements are taken and averaged. This method also reduces the impact of random errors by cancelinging them out.\n\nGiven this analysis, both signal averaging and averaging the results from multiple samples (i.e., III only, are effective in minimizing the influence of random errors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. III only"
