Apply the punitive damage rule in Washington since that is where the plaintiff resides.\n\nIn the United States, federal courts generally apply the law of the state where the court is located (in \"lex loci delicti\" principle) to determine the applicable law in a case. However, punitive damages are a matter of state law, and federal courts will typically apply the law of the state where the plaintiff resides ( the \"lex loci rei sitae\" principle) to determine whether punitive damages are available. Therefore, in this case, the federal court in Washington should apply the punitive damage rule of Washington, where the plaintiff resides."
