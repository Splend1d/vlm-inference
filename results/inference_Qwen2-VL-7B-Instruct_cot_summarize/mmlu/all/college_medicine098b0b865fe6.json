When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\nA. Behaviorist\nB. Psychoanalytic\nC. Cognitive behavioral\nD. Humanistic\n"

Psychoanalytic\n\nPsychoanalytic focuses on the role of unconscious thoughts, feelings, and experiences in shaping behavior. In this case, the officer's behavior is influenced by his unconscious feelings towards his father, which are driving by his past experiences and emotions. This unconscious bias is a key concept in psychoanalytic theory."
