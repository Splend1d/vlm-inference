                    "text": "A manufacturer of appliances put a washing machine of a new and advanced design on the market. Two years of experimental use prior to commercial marketing had demonstrated that the machine laundered clothes more cleanly, more rapidly, and at a lower cost than any previous model. After nine months of commercial sales on a nationwide basis, the manufacturer discovered that an electrical unit in the machine tended to overheat greatly when the machine was heavily loaded or used continuously for more than one hour. The manufacturer promptly notified all dealers that it was recalling machines still in dealers' stock for corrective adjustment. It also provided all dealers with forms of notice to previous purchasers, warning the purchasers of the hazard, urging the purchasers to arrange with the dealers to pick up the machines, with full reimbursement to the purchasers (at the manufacturer's expense); and advising the purchasers who wished to use the machines pending pickup by the dealer to do so only with a clothes load of not more than one-half the machine's capacity and for no longer than three-quarters of an hour. A purchaser of a washing machine, having been notified, arranged on Thursday to have a dealer pick up her machine on the following Monday. Over the weekend, the purchaser was visited by her married daughter and two grandchildren, aged 5 and 3. On Saturday, the purchaser left the house to go shopping. She forgot to warn her daughter about the washing machine. The daughter undertook to do a heavy load of accumulated laundry, including children's clothing and bedding. She loaded the machine fully and repeatedly for an hour and a quarter. Leaving the laundry room with the children in it, she retired for a brief nap. The machine overheated; its paint caught fire, and the fire spread to the window curtains . The children were felled by the smoke. Awakened by the smell of smoke, the daughter rushed down to the laundry, screaming for help. A neighbor rushed into the house after phoning the fire station. Together they entered the laundry room and lifted and carried out the children. The daughter and the neighbor both suffered injuries from the fire and smoke in rescuing the children. Firemen soon arrived and extinguished the fire. If the daughter asserts a claim based on strict liability against the manufacturer for damages, the probable result is that the manufacturer will\n\nA. win, because the daughter was not the purchaser of the washing machine.\nB. win, because the manufacturer issued warnings to dealers and purchasers regarding the defect.\nC. lose, because the manufacturer negligently designed the washing machine.\nD. lose, because the washing machine was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\n"

The fact that the manufacturer had issued warnings to dealers and purchasers regarding the defect does not necessarily absolve the manufacturer of liability. The warnings were given after the machine had already been sold, and the manufacturer would still be responsible for any defects that existed at the time of sale. The manufacturer's negligence in not ensuring the machine was safe for use would likely be a key factor in the outcome of the case."
