The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing\u2026the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack\u2026.The attack yesterday\u2026has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas\u2026.As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\"\nPresident Franklin D.

The immediate consequence of this attack was the declaration of war by the United States against Japan.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Trade embargoes with Japan extending up through the 1980s\n- This is not the immediate consequence. Trade embargoes were not the direct result of the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nB. The Battle of Normandy\n- This occurred in 1944, several years after the Pearl Harbor attack, so it is not the immediate consequence.\n\nC. The internment of Japanese-Americans\n- This event occurred in 1942, after the Pearl Harbor attack, so it is not the immediate consequence.\n\nD. The bombing of Nagasaki\n- This occurred in 1945, after the Pearl Harbor attack, so it is not the immediate consequence.\n\nThe most immediate consequence of the events described in the excerpt is the declaration of war by the United States against Japan, which led to the United States entering World War II.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The Battle of Normandy"
