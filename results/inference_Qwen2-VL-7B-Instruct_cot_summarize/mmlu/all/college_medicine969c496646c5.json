Self-esteem hypothesis: This hypothesis suggests that individuals with higher self-esteem are less likely to engage in prejudiced behavior. By increasing access to education and community improvement projects, the task force aims to enhance the self-esteem of individuals from different groups, thereby reducing prejudice.\n\nII. Contact hypothesis: This hypothesis posits that increased contact between members of different groups can reduce prejudice and promote understanding. The task force's recommendation of paid community improvement projects open to people from different groups alignss with this hypothesis, as it encourages interaction and cooperation between individuals from different backgrounds.\n\nIII. Hypothesis: This option is not specific enough to identify a particular hypothesis. It is likely that the task force is referring to the Contact hypothesis, but without more context, it is not possible to determine if it is referring to another hypothesis.\n\nIV. Legal hypothesis: This hypothesis suggests that legal measures can be effective in reducing prejudice and hate crimes. The task force's recommendation of stricter anti-hate ordinances alignss with this hypothesis, as it aims to enforce laws that penalize hate crimes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. II, III, and IV"
