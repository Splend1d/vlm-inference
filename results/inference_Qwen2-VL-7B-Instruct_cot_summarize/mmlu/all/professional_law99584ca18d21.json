At trial, the customer shows the court a printed statement from a printer's association defining the minimum standard of skill for the printing industry in the community.

The court should\n\nA. grant the request, because it promotes expeditious and economical disposition of the proceedings.\nB. grant the request, because the standard of care is amply supported by information supplied to the court.\nC. deny the request, because judicial notice cannot be taken of matters that are ultimate issues in the case.\nD. deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute.\n"

However, the court should not take judicial notice of a printed statement if there is a reasonable dispute about its accuracy or relevance to the case. In this scenario, the court should not take judicial notice of the printed statement unless it is clear that the statement is accurate and relevant to the case."
