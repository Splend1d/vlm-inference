He finally saw a public defender who filed a motion to dismiss alleging an unconstitutional detention in violation of due process. The prosecution countered that the state's rules allowed for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days, and that the procedure was constitutional. Will the court most likely decide that this detention is unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination.\nB. No, because each case must be decided on its own facts and there may be many good reasons why the state has not yet provided a probable cause determination.\nC. Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\nD. No, because it is constitutional to hold someone for up to 15 days without a probable cause determination.\n"

Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\n\nThe court is likely to decide that the detention is unconstitutional because the Supreme Court has established that an individual cannot be held in custody without probable cause for an extended period, especially when the arrest was made without a warrant. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that the government provide a prompt probable cause determination when it detains an individual. The fact that the state's rules allow for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days does not necessarily mean that such a detention is constitutional. Each case must be decided on its own facts, but the general principle that prompt probable cause determinations are required is well-established in the law."
