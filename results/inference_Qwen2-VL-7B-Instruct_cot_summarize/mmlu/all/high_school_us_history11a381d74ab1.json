It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nJohnson's Great Society most represented an extension of which of the following initiatives?\n\nA. The New Deal\nB. The Square Deal\nC. The Truman Doctrine\nD. The Monroe Doctrine\n"

The New Deal - This was a series of programs, public works initiatives, and financial reforms enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States during the early 1930s. The New Deal aimed to provide relief to the poor, create jobs, and reform the financial system. It focused on addressing the economic challenges of the Great Depression.\n\nB. The Square Deal - This was a series of policies and reforms proposed by President Theodore Roosevelt in the early 1900s. The Square Deal aimed to promote fair competition, protect the environment, and regulate big business. It focused on addressing issues of industrial concentration and environmental degradation.\n\nC. The Truman Doctrine - This was a policy formulated by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, which committed the United States to contain the spread of communism. It focused on supporting free nations against communist aggression.\n\nD. The Monroe Doctrine - This was a policy formulated by President James Monroe in 1823, which stated that the Americas were off-limits to European colonization and that the United States would not interfere in European affairs. it focused on asserting American sovereignty and independence.\n\nGiven the context of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, which aimed to address poverty, racial injustice, and promote a society where every child could find knowledge to enrich their minds, it is most aligned with the principles of the New Deal. The New Deal focused on providing relief to the poor, create jobs, and reform the financial system, which aligns with the goals of the Great Society.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The New Deal"
