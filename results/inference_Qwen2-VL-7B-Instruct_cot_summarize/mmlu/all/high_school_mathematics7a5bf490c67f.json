Then, we divide the entire equation by 2 to get $x^2 + 6x + 1.5 = 0$. \n\nNext, we complete the square on the left side of the equation. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, square it, and add it to both sides. Half of 6 is 3, and 3 squared is 9. So, we add 9 to both sides to get $x^2 + 6x + 9 = 7.5$. \n\nThis equation can be rewritten as $(x + 3)^2 = 7.5$. \n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $x + 3 = \\pm \\sqrt{7.5}$. \n\nSo, the two solutions are $x = -3 + \\sqrt{7.5}$ and $x = -3 - \\sqrt{7.5}$. \n\nThe positive difference between these solutions is $2\\sqrt{7.5} = 5\\sqrt{2$. \n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
