During the MRI, the technicians saw at least two identifiable sponges that had been left in her body. She had to be hospitalized for additional surgery. The patient sued the hospital and doctor for medical malpractice. She did not produce the printouts of the MRI. Instead, she attempted to testify to what she observed on the MRI scan. The defense objected and insisted that she must produce the actual MRI printouts. What is the most likely ruling of the trial judge with respect to the objection?\n\nA. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson can testify to things of common knowledge, such as what a sponge looks like.\nB. She does have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson cannot testify to personal observations.\nC. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because she can testify as to the content of her own medical records.\nD. She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.\n"

She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.\n\nIn legal terms, the best evidence rule generally requires that the original document or the best available evidence be presented in court. In this case, the MRI scan is the original document that provides the best evidence of what was observed during the procedure. The patient's testimony alone is not sufficient to prove the presence of the sponges. Therefore, the trial judge is likely to rule that the MRI records must be produced as the best evidence to support the patient's claim."
