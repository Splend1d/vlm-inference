A Mexican entrepreneur founds and locates a software company in St. Louis.\n\nThis option increases aggregate demand in the United States because it introduces new economic activity and jobs in the U.S. economy. The presence of a new software company in St. Louis would likely lead to increased spending on goods and services, which would boost the overall demand for products and services in the U.S. economy."
