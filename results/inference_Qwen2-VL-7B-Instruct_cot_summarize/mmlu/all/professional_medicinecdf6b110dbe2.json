Physical examination shows numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face. His vision is normal. Ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact. The gag reflex is present. Sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin. Sensation also is absent over the right side of the tongue. X-rays of the skull show fractures of the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting which of the following locations?\n\nA. Foramen lacerum\nB. Foramen ovale\nC. Foramen rotundum\nD. Foramen spinosum\n"

Foramen lacerum\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including the absence of sensation over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin, and the absence of sensation over the right side of the tongue, suggest a lesion affecting the trigeminal nerve. The foramen lacerum is a bony opening in the temporal bone that transmits the trigeminal nerve, and damage to this area can result in the described sensory loss."
