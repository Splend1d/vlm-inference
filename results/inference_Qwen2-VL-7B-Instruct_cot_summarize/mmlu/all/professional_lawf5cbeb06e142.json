He signed a note to the bank and secured repayment of the loan with a mortgage. After purchasing the house, the man borrowed money from his credit union to make the repairs. The man signed a note to the credit union; this note was also secured by a mortgage on the house. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order granted. The man was personally liable on both loans. The man moved into the house and made the necessary repairs. He later defaulted on the debt to the bank, and the bank initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the credit union as parties to the action. An outside party acquired the house at the foreclosure sale. After the expenses of the sale and the balance due the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale proceeds. The outstanding balance of the credit union loan is $20,000. The man and the credit union both claim the $5,000. There is no applicable statute. Who is entitled to the $5,000?\n\nA. The credit union, because the credit union has priority.\nB. The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.\nC. The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.\nD. The man, because the outside party received title to the house subject to the second mortgage.\n"

This means that the bank's loan must be repaid first, and any remaining proceeds go to the credit union.\n\n2. **Man's Personal Liability**: The man is personally liable on both loans. This means that if the bank's loan is not repaid, the man is responsible for the remaining balance.\n\n3. **Credit Union's Loan**: The credit union's mortgage is secondary to the bank's mortgage. Therefore, after the bank's loan is repaid, any remaining proceeds go to the credit union.\n\nGiven these points, the $5,000 should go to the credit union because it has priority over the man's personal liability and the bank's loan.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.**"
