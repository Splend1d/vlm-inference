Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum\nB. After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.\nC. The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption\nD. Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported\n"

Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported.\n\nThis statement is correct because triglycerides (triacylglycerols) need to be emulsified by bile salts and digested by lipases before they can be absorbed into the enterocytes of the small intestine. The fatty acids and monoglycerides produced by this process are then transported across the enterocyte membrane and into the bloodstream."
