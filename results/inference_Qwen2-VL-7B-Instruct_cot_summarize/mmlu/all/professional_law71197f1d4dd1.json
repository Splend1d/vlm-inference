At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.\nB. No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.\nC. Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.\nD. Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 policy provision in his case-in-chief.\n"

Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reasonable jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.\n\nIn a civil case, a motion for judgment as a matter of law ( (also known as a motion for directed verdict) is typically made after the plaintiff has rested their case. However, in this scenario, the company presented evidence that the man's behavior was unduly risky, which is a key issue in the case. If the court grants the motion, it means that the court is ruling that there is no reasonable basis for the jury to find in favor of the plaintiff. Since the company's evidence was uncontradicted, the court would likely find that no reasonable jury could find that the policy covers the man's injuries."
