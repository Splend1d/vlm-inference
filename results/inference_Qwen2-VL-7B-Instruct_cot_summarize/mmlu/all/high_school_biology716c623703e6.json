It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the organism described ( giving birth to only one offspring at a time and having a relatively long life-span for its body size - it is likely that the organism requires relatively high parental care of offspring. This is because the long life-span and the single offspring per birth suggest that the offspring may be dependent on parental care for a longer period of time, which is typical for many long-lived species."
