Zero divisors are elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in a ring such that \\(a \\neq 0\\) and \\(b \\neq 0\\) but \\(a \\cdot b = 0\\).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The ring of complex numbers (\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))\n- In \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), the product of two nonzero complex numbers is never zero. This is because the complex numbers form a field, and fields do not have zero divisors.\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11 (\\(\\mathbb{Z}_{11}\\))\n- In \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{11}\\), the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, \\(2 \\cdot 6 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\mod 11\\), but \\(2 \\cdot 6 = 0 \\mod 11\\). Thus, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{11}\\) has zero divisors.\n\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on \\([0, 1]\\)\n- In this ring, the product of two nonzero functions can be zero. For example, consider \\(f(x) = 1\\) and \\(g(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x \\in [0, 1]\\). The product \\(f(x) \\cdot g(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x \\in [0, 1]\\), even though both \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are nonzero functions.\n\nD. The ring \\(\\{a + b \\cdot \\sqrt{2} : a\\) and \\(b\\) are rational numbers\\)\n- In this ring, the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, consider \\(a + b \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(c + d \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\). If \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 0\\), then \\(a + b \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 0\\). Similarly, if \\(c = 0\\) and \\(d = 0\\), then \\(c + d \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 0\\). Thus, the product \\(0 \\cdot 0 = 0\\), even though both elements are nonzero.\n\nTherefore, the rings in which the product of two nonzero elements can be zero are:\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11 (\\(\\mathbb{Z}_{11}\\))\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on \\([0, 1]\\)\nD. The ring \\(\\{a + b \\cdot \\sqrt{2} : a\\) and \\(b\\) are rational numbers\\)\n\nSo, the correct answers are B, C, and D."
