He might be discussing the civilizing effect of not executing criminals, which suggests that the refusal to execute criminals can have a positive impact on society.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. We should refrain from imposing the death penalty.\n- This option suggests a general prohibition against the death penalty, which is a broader stance than what van den Haag might be specifically addressing.\n\nB. The refusal to execute criminals has a civilizing effect.\n- This option align directly with the idea that not executing criminals can have a positive impact on society, which is a common argument in discussions about the death penalty.\n\nC. We should institute death by torture.\n- This option is contradictory to the argument about the civilizing effect and would not align with van den Haag's argument.\n\nD. Murder is wrong.\n- This is a general moral statement about the wrongnessness of murder, which is not directly related to the civil effects of not executing criminals.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting conclusion according to van den Haag's argument is:\n\nB. The refusal to execute criminals has a civil civil effect.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
