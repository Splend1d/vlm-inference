According to the study results, alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). The researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Subsequent statistical analysis does not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group. The scenario described is an example of which of the following?\n\nA.

Confounding**.\n\nConfounding occurs when a third variable ( (in this case, smoking) influences both the independent variable ( (alcohol consumption) and the dependent variable ( (lung cancer). This third variable can obscure the true relationship between the independent and dependent variables, making it appear as if there is no association when there actually is one. In this case, the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer might be confounded by smoking, which is a known risk factor for both alcohol consumption and lung cancer. When the subjects are divided into smokers and non-smokers, the confounding effect of smoking is removed, revealing that alcohol consumption is not associated with lung cancer within either group."
