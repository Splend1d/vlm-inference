The agreement of a large number of individual agents to restrict their own pollution.\n\nMutual coercion, mutually agreed upon, refers to a situation where multiple parties voluntarily agree to take actions that benefit each other. In this context, it means that a large number of individual agents agree to restrict their own pollution, which benefits the environment and potentially the health and well-being of all individuals involved. This is an example of mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon, as it involves voluntary action taken by individuals for the collective good."
