The elements of \\(Z_7\\) are \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\n\nLet's test each element:\n\n1. For \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[0^3 + 2*0 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\\]\nSince \\(2 \\neq 0\\) in \\(Z_7\\), \\(0\\) is not a root.\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[1^3 + 2*1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\\]\nSince \\(5 \\neq 0\\) in \\(Z_7\\), \\(1\\) is not a root.\n\n3. For \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14\\]\nIn \\(Z_7\\), \\(14\\) is equivalent to \\(0\\) because \\(14 \\equiv 0\\) ( (mod \\(7\\)). So, \\(2\\) is a root.\n\n4. For \\(x = 3\\):\n\\[3^3 + 2*3 + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35\\]\nIn \\(Z_7\\), \\(35\\) is equivalent to \\(1\\) because \\(35 \\equiv 1\\) ( (mod \\(7\\)). So, \\(3\\) is not a root.\n\n5. For \\(x = 4\\):\n\\[4^3 + 2*4 + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74\\]\nIn \\(Z_7\\), \\(74\\) is equivalent to \\(4\\) because \\(74 \\equiv 4\\) ( (mod \\(7\\)). So, \\(4\\) is not a root.\n\n6. For \\(x = 5\\):\n\\[5^3 + 2*5 + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137\\]\nIn \\(Z_7\\), \\(137\\) is equivalent to \\(2\\) because \\(137 \\equiv 2\\) ( (mod \\(7\\)). So, \\(5\\) is not a root.\n\n7. For \\(x = 6\\):\n\\[6^3 + 2*6 + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230\\]\nIn \\(Z_7\\), \\(230\\) is equivalent to \\(6\\) because \\(230 \\equiv 6\\) ( (mod \\(7\\)). So, \\(6\\) is not a root.\n\nTherefore, the only zero of the polynomial \\(x^3 + 2x + 2\\) in \\(Z_7\\) is \\(2\\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. 2."
