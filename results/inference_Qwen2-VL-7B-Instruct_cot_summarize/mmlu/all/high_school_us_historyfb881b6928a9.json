We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich one of the following political movements most closely shared many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party?\n\nA.

Struggles between political parties for power and plunder.\n2. Grievous wrongs inflicted upon the suffering people.\n3. Lack of serious effort by political parties to prevent or restrain existing conditions.\n4. Agreement to ignore all issues except the tariff.\n5. Sacrifice of homes, lives, and children for the benefit of the wealthy.\n6. A call to restore the government to the hands of the \"plain people.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Progressivism of the early 1900s**: This focused on social and political reforms, including issues like corruption, labor rights, and the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth. This's goals align closely with the Populist Party's emphasis on addressing the plight of the common people and reforming.\n\nB. **Neoconservatism of the 1980s**: focused on conservative principles, such as limited government, free markets, and traditional values. This movement does not align with the Populist Party's emphasis on addressing the suffering of the common people and reform.\n\nC. **Federalism of the late 1700s**: focused on the balance of power between the federal government and the states. This's goals do not align with the Populist Party's emphasis on addressing the suffering of the common people and reform.\n\nD. **Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s**: focused on the common man's voice in government and the need for a more democratic system. This's goals align closely with the Populist Party's emphasis on restoring government to the hands of the \"plain people.\"\n\nWhile both A and D share some similarities with the Populist Party's goals, A (Progressivism of the early 1900s) more closely aligns with the Populist Party's emphasis on social and political reforms to address the suffering of the common people.\n\nTherefore, the most closely shared political movement with the goals outlined by the Populist Party is:\n\n**A. Progressivism of the early 1900s**"
