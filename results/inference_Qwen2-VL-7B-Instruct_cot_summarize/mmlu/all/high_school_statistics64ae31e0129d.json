A 95% confidence interval of mean height of teachers in a small town.\n- This option involves estimating the mean height of teachers in a small town. A census would not be appropriate here because it would be impractical and costly to measure the height of every single teacher in the town.\n\nB. A 95% confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class.\n- This option involves estimating the proportion of students in a small town who are taking AP classes. A census would not be appropriate here because it would be impractical and costly to measure the AP class participation of every single student in the town.\n\nC. A two-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis was that the mean expenditure on entertainment by male students at a high school is the same as that of female students.\n- This option involves testing a hypothesis about the mean expenditure on entertainment between male and female students at a high school. A census would not be appropriate here because it would be impractical and costly to measure the expenditure of every single student at the high school.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This option is the correct choice because none of the given options are appropriate for using a census. Each option involves estimating a population parameter or testing a hypothesis about a population, which typically requires a sample rather than a census.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above."
