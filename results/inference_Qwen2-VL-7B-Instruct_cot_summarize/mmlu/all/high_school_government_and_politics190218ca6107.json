Each group is dependent on the other to perform its job effectively.\n\nThis option highlights the mutual dependency between politicians and political reporters. Politicians rely on reporters to inform the public about their actions and policies, while reporters rely on politicians to provide them with news stories and information. This dependency helps to temper the adversarial nature of their relationship, as both sides need each other to fulfill their respective roles effectively."
