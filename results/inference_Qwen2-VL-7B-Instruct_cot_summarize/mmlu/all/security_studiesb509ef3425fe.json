Human security is threatened by global inequality, because 3s of the world population do not share the benefits of globalisation. However, this inequality does not translate into political instability or involve military action.\nB. Global inequality creates disenfranchised populations who, although discontent with their situation, lack the agency to rebel or protest.\nC. Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\nD. Global inequality does not present a significant threat to global security.\n"

When a significant portion of the population feels marginalized and disenfranchised, they may become radicalized and engage in revolutionary uprisings. This can lead to political instability and even military action, which can have a ripple effect on global security."
