The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\nB. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer's protocol to the other computer's protocol.\nC. The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers.\nD. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n"

The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n\nExplanation: The Internet is built on a set of standard protocols, such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which allows different computers to communicate with each other regardless of the specific hardware or software used. This means that a computer running a Web server and a computer running a Web browser can communicate directly over the Internet without the need for additional hardware to convert data packets between different protocols."
