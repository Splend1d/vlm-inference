In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following beliefs, supported first by Calvin, does this passage seem to best support?\n\nA. Salvation\nB. Predestination\nC. Divinity of Jesus\nD. Simony\n"

                    "text": "To determine which belief is supported by Calvin in this passage, we need to carefully analyze the content and context provided.\n\nThe passage discusses the concept of election and salvation, emphasizing that salvation is a result of God's goodness and grace, not due to any human merit or effort. Calvin argues that those who try to obscure this principle are doing a disservice to both God and humanity, as it is essential for humility and a proper understanding of one's's obligations to God.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Salvation - This is directly discussed in the passage, with Calvin asserting that salvation is a result of God's goodness and grace.\n\nB. Predestination - While the passage does touch on the idea of election, which is a form of predestination, it does not explicitly focus on predestination as a separate belief.\n\nC. Divinity of Jesus - The passage does not discuss the divinity of Jesus, which is a separate theological concept.\n\nD. Simony - The passage does not mention simony, which refers to the sale of church offices or other ecclesiastical positions.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage most clearly supports the belief in salvation.\n\nFinal answer: A. Salvation"
