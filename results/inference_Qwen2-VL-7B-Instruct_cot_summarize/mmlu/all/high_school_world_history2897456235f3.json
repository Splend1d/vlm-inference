                    "text": "To determine the most probable cause of the marital strain evident in the passage, let's analyze the context and the content of the letter.\n\nThe letter is written by a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, indicating that the trader has been away for a long time. The trader expresses his desire to return home but acknowledges that he may not be able to do so immediately due to financial constraints. He offers his wife the option to end their marriage if she wishes, suggesting that the separation has been a significant strain on their relationship.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The strain placed on merchant families by long period of separation\n- This option directly addresses the long separation, which is a significant factor in the marital strain mentioned in the letter.\n\nB. Religious disagreements arising from the merchant's exposure to Hinduism\n- While the trader is Jewish and may have been exposed to Hinduism, there is no specific mention of religious disagreements in the letter. The focus is more on the physical separation and financial situation.\n\nC. A decision on the part of the merchant to remain permanently in India\n- The letter does not indicate that the trader has decided to remain permanently in India. It only mentions the possibility of not being able to return home immediately.\n\nD. Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home\n- Although the trader acknowledges financial constraints, the letter does not explicitly state that bankruptcy is the cause of the marital strain. The primary concern is the separation and the trader's inability to return home.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most probable cause of the marital strain evident in the passage is:\n\nA. The strain placed on merchant families by long period of separation.\n\nFinal answer: A."
