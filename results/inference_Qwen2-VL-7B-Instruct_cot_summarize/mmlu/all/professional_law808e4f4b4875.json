The women tried to leave the store and, as they did, the clerk grabbed the bag, which fell to the floor. When the bag hit the floor, the gun discharged, killing the clerk. Which of the following would be the women's best defense to the charge of felony murder?\n\nA. They committed a larceny by placing the three dresses in the shopping bag.\nB. The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\nD. The killing, was accidental and unintended.\n"

The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\n\nThe agency theory of of felony murder suggests that a person can be guilty of felony murder if they are an accomplice to the felony and the killing occurs during the commission of that felony. In this case, the women were committing larceny (theft by placing the dresses in the shopping bag. The gun discharge was an unintended consequence of their actions, but since they were in the process of committing a felony (theft, they could be held responsible for the resulting death under the agency theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
