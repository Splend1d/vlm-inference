Therefore, the probability of being on time in this case is \\( 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \\).\n\nIf he rolls a 3 or larger and grabs a quick lighter breakfast, the probability of being late for school is 6%, or 0.06. Therefore, the probability of being on time in this case is \\( 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 \\).\n\nTo find the overall probability of being on time, we multiply the probability of each event happening and then sum them up:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{on time}) = P(\\text{roll 1 or 2}) \\times P(\\text{on time | roll 1 or 2}) + P(\\text{roll 3 or larger}) \\times P(\\text{on time | roll 3 or larger}) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{on time}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 0.85 + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\times 0.94 \\]\n\n\\[ p(\\text{on time}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.85 + \\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.94 \\]\n\n\\[ p(\\text{on time}) = 0.2833 + 0.6267 \\]\n\n\\[ p(\\text{on time}) = 0.91 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Semir will be on time for school any given day is 0.91, which corresponds to option D."
