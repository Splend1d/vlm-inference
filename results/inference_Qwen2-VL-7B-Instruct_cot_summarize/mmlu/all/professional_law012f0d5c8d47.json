The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that\n\nA. the leasehold contract was void ab initio.\nB. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.\nC. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.\nD. the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.\n"

In this case, the lease agreement was initially signed by both the student and the widow, and the student continued to pay rent and the widow accepted it, indicating that the agreement was binding and enforceable. Therefore, the student would have a strong legal basis to argue that the terms of the leasehold contract were binding and that the widow cannot unilaterally terminate the agreement without proper notice or cause."
