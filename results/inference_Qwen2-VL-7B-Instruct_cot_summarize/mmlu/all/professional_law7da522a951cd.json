Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is\n\nA. inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.\nB. inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.\nC. admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.\nD. admissible, because the original contract was lost.\n"

These criteria typically include:\n\n1. The copy must be a true and accurate representation of the original.\n2. The copy must be in a form that is easily accessible and available for inspection.\n3. The copy must be authenticated by a credible source, such as a witness or a notary public.\n\nIn this case, the duplicate carbon copy of the written contract is likely to be admissible as evidence because it is a true and accurate representation of the original contract, and it was created at the time of the sale. The fact that the original contract was lost does not automatically render the copy inadmissible; rather, it is the responsibility of the party introducing the the copy to prove its authenticity and reliability."
