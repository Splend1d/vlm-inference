Reports of the drug being tied to cases of premature dementia surfaced, and a number of lawsuits were filed by injured consumers, alleging strict liability for a defective product. At trial, the manufacturer proved that thorough testing was done but that new scientific discoveries, not then available, now show a vulnerability in certain people to the drug. Is the company strictly liable to the victims even though the medical knowledge was not available when the product was developed and put on the market?\n\nA. Yes, strict liability applies to pharmaceutical companies and questions of knowledge of defects is irrelevant.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer must assume the cost of compensating those innocent victims who took the defective drug.\nC. No, the company has no duty to conduct research to determine a product's safety.\nD. No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n"

No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n\nIn the context of strict liability for defective products, the key issue is whether the manufacturer had knowledge of the defect at the time the product was put on the market. If the manufacturer can prove that it was not aware of the defect at the time of the product's introduction, and that the defect was not foreseeable, then strict liability may not apply. In this case, the manufacturer's claim that new scientific discoveries have revealed a vulnerability in certain people to the drug suggests that the defect was not known at the time the product was developed and marketed. Therefore, the company would not be strictly liable for the defective product."
