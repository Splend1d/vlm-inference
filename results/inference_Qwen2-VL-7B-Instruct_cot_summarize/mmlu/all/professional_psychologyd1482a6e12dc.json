He found that high-anxiety research participants were more likely to affiliate with other high-anxiety participants. This tendency can be explained by the desire to relieve discomfort. High-anxiety individuals may seek out others who share their anxiety to feel less alone and to find comfort in the shared experience. This is a form of social support that can help alleviate anxiety.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nA. Demand characteristics: This refers to the participants' awareness of the experimenter's expectations and how they might influence their behavior. While demand characteristics can affect behavior, they do not specifically explain the desire to affiliate with others based on anxiety levels.\n\nB. Evaluation apprehension: This is the fear of negative evaluation by others. While high-anxiety individuals might be concerned about being evaluated, this does not directly explain their desire to affiliate with others based on anxiety levels.\n\nD. Social comparison: This is the process of evaluating one's's own characteristics by comparing them with those of others. While social comparison can influence behavior, it does not specifically explain the desire to affiliate with others based on anxiety levels.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate explanation for the desire of high-anxiety research participants to wait with other high-anxiety participants is C. relief from discomfort."
