Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nIn the scenario described, the original owner of the real estate conveyed a life estate to a friend for the friend's lifetime. When the original owner died, the life estate owner (the friend in this case \u2014 conveyed his interest to his children. This transfer of the life estate to the children is valid because a life estate is a type of estate that can be conveyed by the life tenant (the original owner in this case) to third persons during their lifetime. \n\nTherefore, the children of the life estate owner have an enforceable interest in the property."
