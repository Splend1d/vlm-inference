The carpenter agreed to bid if the general contractor would agree to give the carpenter the job provided that his bid was lowest and the general contractor was awarded the main contract. The general contractor so agreed. The carpenter, incurring time and expense in preparing his bid, submitted the lowest carpentry bid. The general contractor used the carpenter's bid in calculating its own bid, which was successful. Which of the following best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter?\n\nA. The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.\nB. The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.\nC. The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.\nD. The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.\n"

                    "text": "The carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter hinges on the concept of reliance and the nature of the agreement between the two parties. The carpenter incurred time and expense in preparing his bid based on the general contractor's conditional promise. This reliance is a critical element in establishing the carpenter's claim.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.**\n   - This option directly addresses the carpenter's reliance on the general contractor's promise. The carpenter's reliance on the promise is a key factor in establishing the obligation of the general contractor to award the subcontract to the carpenter.\n\nB. **The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.**\n   - While consideration is important in contracts, the carpenter's reliance on the promise is more directly relevant to the obligation at hand. This option is less directly supportive of the carpenter's position.\n\nC. **The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.**\n   - This option discusses the general contractor's duty to deal fairly, which is a broader concept and does not specifically address the obligation to award the subcontract to the carpenter based on the conditional promise.\n\nD. **The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.**\n   - This option introduces the owner of the building and the concept of intended beneficiaries, which is not directly relevant to the carpenter's reliance on the general contractor's promise.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that most directly supports the carpenter's position is:\n\n**A. The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the carpenter's reliance on the general contractor's promise, which is the core of the carpenter's claim."
