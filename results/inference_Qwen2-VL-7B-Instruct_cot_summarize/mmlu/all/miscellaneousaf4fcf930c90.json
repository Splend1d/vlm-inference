This period is known for the rapid diversification of life forms, often referred to as the \"Cambrian explosion.\" The presence of a large number of fossils from this period, including primitive members of modern phyla, indicates that many of the fundamental groups of animal life first appeared during this time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 540 million years ago"
