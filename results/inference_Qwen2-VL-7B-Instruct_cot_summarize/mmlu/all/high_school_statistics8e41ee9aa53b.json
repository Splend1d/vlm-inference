Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the critical t-value for a one-sided test with df = 13 and P-value = 0.075 is approximately 1.356.\n\nGiven that the P-value is 0.075, the t-value must be less than the critical t-value for a one-sided test. Therefore, the range of t-values that would have given this P-value is:\n\n**B. 1.356 < t < 1.782**\n\nThis is because the t-value must be less than the critical t-value for a one-sided test with df = 13 and P-value = 0.075."
