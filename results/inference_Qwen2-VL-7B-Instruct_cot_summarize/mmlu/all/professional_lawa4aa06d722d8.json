The parties agreed orally on a price of $100,000 for the system, but continued to negotiate over several points. When all matters regarding the air-conditioning system were finally settled, the parties signed a written agreement. It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?\n\nA. No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.\nB. No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\nC. Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\nD. Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n"

This is because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause, which means that the court will consider any evidence of prior agreements or negotiations between the parties. The oral agreement, even though not included in the written contract, is relevant to the question of whether the written agreement should be reformed to reflect the parties's true intentions."
