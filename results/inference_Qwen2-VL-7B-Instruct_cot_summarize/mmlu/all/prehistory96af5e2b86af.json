There was no evidence for monumental architecture or roads.\n\nCatalhoyuk is often described as a large village rather than a city because it lacks the typical features associated with urban centers. Specifically, there is no evidence of monumental architecture, such as temples or palaces, nor are there extensive road systems that would facilitate the movement of goods and people. Additionally, the absence of clear evidence for status differentiation and the lack of large-scale public buildings further support the classification of Catalhoyuk as a large village rather than a city."
