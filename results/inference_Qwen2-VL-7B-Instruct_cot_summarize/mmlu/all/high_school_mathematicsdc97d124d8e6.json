Since there are 400 pages and Veronica counted 200 words on one quarter of a typical page, we can assume that there are 800 words per page ( (200 words per quarter page * 4 quarters per page).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:\n\nTotal words = Number of pages * Words per page\nTotal words = 400 pages * 800 words per page\nTotal words = 320,000 words\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it will take Veronica to read the book:\n\nTime ( (in minutes) = Total words / Words per minute\nTime = 320,000 words / 250 words per minute\nTime = 1,280 minutes\n\nTo the nearest minute, it will take Veronica 1,280 minutes to read the book.
