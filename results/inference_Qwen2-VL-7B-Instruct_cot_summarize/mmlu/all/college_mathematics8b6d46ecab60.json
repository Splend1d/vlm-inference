According to the Heine-Borel theorem, in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. If \\(K\\) is compact, it is also bounded. By the Extreme Value Theorem, if \\(f\\) is a continuous function on a compact set \\(K\\), then \\(f\\) attains its maximum and minimum values on \\(K\\). Therefore, \\(f\\) is bounded on \\(K\\).\n\n### Statement II: If every continuous real-valued function defined on \\(K\\) is bounded, then \\(K\\) is compact.\n\nThis statement is false. While it is true that if \\(K\\) is compact, then every continuous function on \\(K\\) is bounded, the converse is not necessarily true. There exist non-compact sets where every continuous function is bounded. For example, consider the set \\(K = ( (0 not compact but every continuous function on \\(K\\) is bounded.\n\n### Statement III: If \\(K\\) is compact, then \\(K\\) is connected.\n\nThis statement is true. In \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), compactness implies connectedness. This is a consequence of the fact that in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), compact sets are precisely those that are both closed and bounded, and connectedness is a property that is preserved under continuous functions. Since every continuous function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum, it follows that \\(K\\) must be connected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. III only"
