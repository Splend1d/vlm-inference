If the array is initially sorted in descending order, then insertion sort will be more efficient than selection sort.\n- This statement is false. Insertion sort has a time worst-case time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), regardless of the initial order of the elements. Selection sort, on the other hand, also a worst-case time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\) as well. Therefore, neither insertion sort nor selection sort will be more efficient in this scenario.\n\nB. The number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.\n- This statement is false. Selection sort compares each element with all the elements that come after it, regardless of their initial order. Therefore, the number of comparisons is dependent on the initial arrangement of elements.\n\nC. The number of comparisons for insertion sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements.\n- This statement is false. Insertion sort compares each element with all the elements that come before it, and the number of comparisons depends on the initial order of the elements. Therefore, the number of comparisons is dependent on the initial arrangement of elements.\n\nD. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.\n- This statement is true. Selection sort involves repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The number of data movements ( i.e., swaps or reassignments of elements, depends on the initial arrangement of elements. If the array is already sorted, there will be fewer swaps compared to when it is not sorted.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is:\n\nD. The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements."
