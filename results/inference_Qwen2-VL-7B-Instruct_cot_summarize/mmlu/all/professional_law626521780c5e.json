Men over 65 must wear only brown or grey attire, while those under 65 must wear button down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action was filed to challenge the Act based on a constitutional attack. Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?\n\nA. The law is unconstitutional because it violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nB. The law is unconstitutional because it is primarily discriminatory against women's rights.\nC. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n"

The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that certain fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution and cannot be infringeded upon by the government. The restrictions on makeup, dress, and grooming mandates for both men and women in the \"American Morality Leadership Act\" could be seen as infringing on personal freedom and autonomy, which are considered fundamental rights in many legal systems."
