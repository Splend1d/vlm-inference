The defendant threatened to beat the man to a pulp if he did not pay the money, which fits the definition of extortion.\n\n2. **Battery**: This is the unlawful application of force to another person. The defendant punched the man in the stomach, which is an act of battery.\n\n3. **Robbery**: This involves the use of force or fear to obtain money or property from another person. The defendant demanded the money and then used force (punchinging the man) to obtain it. This fits the definition of robbery.\n\n4. **Assault**: This involves the threat or attempt to commit a violent act. The defendant threatened to beat the man to a pulp, which fits the definition of assault.\n\nGiven the facts, the defendant's actions involved a threat to use force (extortion), the actual use of force (battery), and the taking of property through force (robbery). Therefore, the defendant will most likely be found guilty of:\n\n**B. Extortion and robbery.**"
