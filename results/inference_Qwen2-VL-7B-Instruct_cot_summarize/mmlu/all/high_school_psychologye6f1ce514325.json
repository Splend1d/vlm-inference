Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\n\nExperiments are designed to establish causal relationships by manipulating one or more independent variables and observing the effect on one or more dependent variables. This isolation of variables allows researchers to determine whether changes in the independent variable cause changes in the dependent variable. Other research methods, such as surveys, observational studies, and case studies, may not be able to control for all variables as effectively, making it more difficult to establish causality."
