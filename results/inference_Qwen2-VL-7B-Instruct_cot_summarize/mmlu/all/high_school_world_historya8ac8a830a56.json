The rural peasantry:** This group would have benefited significantly from the increase in literacy rates, as rural areas often had lower literacy rates due to limited access to education.\n   - **B. Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy:** The clergy would have had access to religious education and literacy, but the overall literacy rates would have still benefited the broader population.\n   - **C. The urban middle class:** This group would have had better access to education and literacy resources, but the overall increase in literacy rates would have benefited the broader population.\n   - **D. Officers in the armed force:** While the armed forces would have had access to literacy training, the overall increase in literacy rates would have benefited the broader population.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The rural peasantry would have benefited the most from the increase in literacy rates, as they had the lowest starting point and the largest relative increase in literacy rates.\n\nTherefore, the segment of the Russian/Soviet population that would have benefited most from the rise in literacy rates depicted in the chart is:\n\n**A. The rural peasantry**"
