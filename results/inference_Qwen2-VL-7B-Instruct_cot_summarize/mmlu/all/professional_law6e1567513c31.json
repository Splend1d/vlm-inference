Finally, the parents of one dead soldier has enough and sues the preacher, and the case goes all the way to the Supreme Court. Would the Court likely find in favor of the preacher or the father?\n\nA. The father, as a funeral is a private affair.\nB. The preacher, because it involves a matter of public interest.\nC. The father, because time, place, and manner restrictions should have been in place.\nD. The father, because the First Amendment does not include protection for vicious verbal assaults such as this.\n"
