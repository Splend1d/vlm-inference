                    "text": "To find the average force exerteded on the ball by the floor, we can use the impulse-momentum theorem. The impulse is equal to the change in momentum of the ball. The momentum of the ball is equal to its mass times its velocity. The change in momentum is equal to the impulse, which is equal to the force times the time of impact. We can use this to find the force exerteded on the ball by the floor.\nThe change in momentum of the ball is equal to the mass of the ball times the change in velocity of the ball. The change in velocity of the ball is equal to the difference between the final velocity of the ball and the initial velocity of the ball. The final velocity of the ball is equal to the initial velocity of the ball times the ratio of the final height of the ball to the initial height of the ball. The initial velocity of the ball is equal to the square root of twice the gravitational acceleration times the initial height of the ball. The final height of the ball is equal to the initial height of the ball. The initial height of the ball is equal to the height of the ball times the ratio of the final height of the ball to the initial height of the ball. The height of the ball is equal to the square root of twice the gravitational acceleration times the initial height of the ball. The gravitational acceleration is equal to 9.8 m/s^2.
