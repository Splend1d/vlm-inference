And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nThe encomienda system, which is described in the text and was used during the colonization of the Americas to regulate the indigenous people, was NOT ended by which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which option describes the encomienda system NOT being ended, we need to carefully analyze the provided information and each option.\n\nThe encomienda system was a system of land grants and labor obligations in the Spanish colonies in the Americas. It was used to regulate the indigenous people and was characterized by the granting of large tracts of of land to Spanish conquerors, who were then responsible for the labor of the indigenous people on those lands.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The protests of the Catholic missionaries against abuses of forced labor:\n- This the encomienda system was criticized and protested against by Catholic missionaries due to the abuses of forced labor. This the system was eventually abolished due to these protests.\n\nB. The lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores:\n- The encomienda system was based on the distribution of land and labor obligations. If there was no new land to assign, the system would lose its foundation.\n\nC. The Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly:\n- The encomienda system was a way for the Spanish crown to indirectly control the estates through the encomienda holders. If the crown wanted to control the estates more directly, it would likely lead to the end of the encomienda system.\n\nD. An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomienda:\n- The encomienda system was based on the labor obligations of the indigenous people. If mestizos were forbidden from working on the encomienda, it would undermine the system's foundation.\n\nGiven the information provided, the encomienda system was NOT ended by the increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomienda.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. An increase in the number of mestizos, who by law were forbidden from working on the encomienda"
