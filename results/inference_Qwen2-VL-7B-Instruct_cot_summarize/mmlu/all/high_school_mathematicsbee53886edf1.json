This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition the number 4 into 2 summands.\n\nThe partitions of 4 into 2 summands are:\n\n- 4 = 4 + 0\n- 4 = 3 + 1\n- 4 = 2 + 2\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.
