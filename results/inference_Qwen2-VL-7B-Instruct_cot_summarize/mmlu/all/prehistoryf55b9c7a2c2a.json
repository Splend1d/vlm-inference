However, genetic evidence from the oldest skeletons in the Americas indicates a closer genetic connection to the native people of central Siberia, suggesting that these early settlers may have come from Asia rather than Europe. This genetic evidence supports the theory of a Bering Strait land bridge migration, where people migrated from Asia to North America via the Bering land bridge during the last ice age."
