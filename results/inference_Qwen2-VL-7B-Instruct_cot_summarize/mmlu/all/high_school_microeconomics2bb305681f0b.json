                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nTo understand why, let's analyze the situation using the concept of marginal revenue product ( (MRP) and marginal cost ( (MC). The MMRP rule states that a firm should continue to hire labor as long as the marginal revenue product of labor ( (MRPL) is greater than the marginal cost of labor ( (MCL). Similarly, the firm should continue to use capital as long as the marginal revenue product of capital ( (MRPC) is greater than the marginal cost of capital ( (MCC).\n\nGiven:\n- Price of labor (P_L) = $2\n- Price of capital (P_C) = $1\n- Marginal product of labor (MP_L) = 200\n- Marginal product of capital (MP_C) = 50\n\nThe marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) is calculated as the marginal product of labor (MP_L) multiplied by the price of labor (P_L), and the marginal revenue product of capital (MRPC) is calculated as the marginal product of capital (MP_C) multiplied by the price of capital P_C).\n\nLet's calculate the MRP values:\n- MRPL = MP_L * P_L = 200 * $2 = $400\n- MRPC = MP_C * P_C = 50 * $1 = $50\n\nSince the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) is greater than the marginal cost of labor (MCL) and the marginal revenue product of capital (MRPC) is greater than the marginal cost of capital (MCC), the firm should continue to hire both labor and capital.\n\nHowever, the question asks what the firm should do to optimize its production. To optimize production, the firm should ensure that the marginal revenue product of each input is equal to its marginal cost. This is known as the marginal rate of technical substitution ( (MRTS).\n\nGiven the current situation, the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) is much higher than the marginal revenue product of capital (MRPC), indicating that the firm is overusing labor relative to capital. To optimize production, the firm should decrease the use of labor and increase the use of capital, which will cause the marginal product of labor to fall and the marginal product of capital to rise.
