S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to \"dirty tricks\" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.\nB. prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.\nC. not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no \"false light. \"\nD. not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.\n"

In the context of invasion of privacy, the publication of true facts does not typically constitute an invasion of privacy. The fact that the apprentice broke into the lawyer's office and copied the letters does not change the analysis of the columnist's actions. The columnist's publication of the true facts does not create a false light or cause an unreasonable invasion of privacy."
