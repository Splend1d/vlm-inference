During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nA sympathetic reader of Logan's Address in the early years of the United States would be most likely to support which of the following Indian policies?\n\nA. Exterminating all Indians\nB. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty\nC. Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico\nD. Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways\n"

                    "text": "To determine which Indian policy a sympathetic reader of Logan's Address would most likely support, we need to carefully analyze the content and sentiments expressed in the address.\n\nLogan's Address is a powerful statement of grief and revenge, reflecting the deep pain and loss experienced by the Shawnee people due to the actions of the white man, particularly Colonel Cresap. Logan expresses a strong sense of justice and a desire for revenge, but also also a deep longing for peace and a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Exterminating all Indians - This option is not supported by Logan's Address. Logan does not advocate for the extermination of Indians but rather for revenge and justice for the harm done to his people.\n\nB. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty - This option aligns closely with Logan's Address. Logan's Address reflects a desire for peace and a peaceful resolution to the conflict, which would likely include respecting the Indian territory and sovereignty.\n\nC. Encourage Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico - This option is not directly supported by Logan's Address. Logan's Address does not mention migration to Canada or Mexico as a solution to the conflict.\n\nD. Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways - This option is not directly supported by Logan's Address. Logan's Address does not advocate for the establishment of reservations or for Indians to change their ways.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most likely policy that a sympathetic reader of Logan's Address would support is:\n\nB. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty"
