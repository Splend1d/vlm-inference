The interrogatories exceed the numbers permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nIn the United States, federal rules of civil procedure generally allow a party to serve up to 30 interrogatories without the need for court approval or an agreement between the parties. However, if the number of interrogatories exceeds this limit, the party served with the interrogatories may seek a protective order from the court to prevent the excessive burden or expense. In this case, since the defendant was served with 25 interrogatories, which is more than the permitted number, the defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on this ground."
