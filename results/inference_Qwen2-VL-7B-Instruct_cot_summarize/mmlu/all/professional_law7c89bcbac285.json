The man signed an agreement with the facility that he would attend weekly classes at the facility for six months and would pay $500 on the first of each month. Upon signing the contract, the man made his first payment of $500 and attended the weekly class sessions. On the first day of the second month, the man once again made his $500 payment and continued to attend the session. At the start of the third month, the man told the director of the facility's accounting office that he was having financial difficulties, and asked for an extension. The director agreed to permit the man to attend classes while the man tried to get the money to pay the facility. One week later, the man received a letter from the facility informing him that he would be barred from attending any further classes unless the next $500 payment was made. Is the facility justified in refusing to permit the man to attend classes?\n\nA. No, because by permitting the man to attend classes without having paid the third monthly installment, the facility waived its right to have that installment fee paid on time.\nB. No, because the facility's allowing the man to attend classes without paying the third monthly installment created an implied contract, thus permitting him to complete the classes without advance payment of the installments.\nC. Yes, because the man's failure to make the third monthly installment payment constituted an anticipatory breach.\nD. Yes, because there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which was a material part of the contract.\n"

Yes, because the man's failure to make the third monthly installment payment constituted an anticipatory breach.\n\nAn anticipatory breach occurs when one party to a contract indicates or acts in such a way that it is clear that they will not perform their obligations under the contract. In this case, the man's request for an extension and subsequent failure to make the third monthly installment payment can be seen as an indication that he would not be able to fulfill his obligation to pay on time. This failure to pay the installment fee on time constitutes an anticipatory breach, which allows the other party ( in this case, the facility - to terminate the contract and refuse further services."
