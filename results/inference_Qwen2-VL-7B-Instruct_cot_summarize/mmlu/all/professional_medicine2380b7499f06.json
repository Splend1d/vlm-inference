The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140\u2013200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c?\n\nA. His daily glucose control is better than recorded\nB. His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced\nC. His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated\nD. His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c\n"

His daily glucose control is better than recorded\n\nThe patient's hemoglobin A1c level of 5.4% is within the normal range for a person with type 1 diabetes mellitus, indicating that his average blood glucose levels over the past 2\u20133 months have been well-controlled. However, his home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations have been ranging from 140\u2013200 mg/dL, which are higher than what would be expected for a well-controlled diabetes patient. This suggests that his daily glucose control is better than what he has been recording in his diabetic diary."
