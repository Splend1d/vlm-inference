The Expectation-Maximization ( (EM) algorithm is commonly used for learning Gaussian mixture models, but gradient descent can also be used for this purpose. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that can be applied to find the parameters of a model that minimize a cost function, which is also the case when learning a Gaussian mixture model.\n\nStatement 2: \"Assuming a fixed number of attributes, a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier can be learned in time linear in the number of records in the dataset.\"\n\nThis statement is also true. The time complexity of learning a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier, assuming a fixed number of attributes, is indeed linear in the number of records in the dataset. This is because the complexity of computing the mean and covariance matrix for each class is linear in the number of records, and these computations are repeated for each class.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
