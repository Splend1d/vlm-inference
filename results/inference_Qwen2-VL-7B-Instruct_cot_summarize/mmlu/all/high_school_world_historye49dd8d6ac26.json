A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nThe inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument is intended to do which of the following?\n\nA. Demonstrate the possibility of African unity\nB. Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers\nC.

The passage by Kwame Nkrumah discusses the importance of African unity and the need for a political union to project the African personality and gain respect from the world. The inclusion of the Congo is a key part of this argument.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Demonstrate the possibility of African unity\n- This option suggests that the inclusion of the Congo is meant to show that African unity is possible. However, the passage does not focus on the potential for unity but rather on the current state of disunity and the need for a political union.\n\nB. Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers\n- This option aligns well with the passage. Nkrumah mentions the Congo as an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers, highlighting the callous disregard of African independence.\n\nC. Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations\n- This option is not relevant to the passage. The passage does not discuss the development of constitutions or their impact on order.\n\nD. Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa\n- While the passage does mention the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the U.N. in the Congo, these are not the primary focus. The main point is about the neglect of African independence by world powers, not specifically blaming European powers.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most fitting answer is:\n\nB. Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers\n\nFinal answer: B."
