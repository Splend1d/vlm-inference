(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the tract of land. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the woman delivered to her daughter, the woman promised to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the woman delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage.

Only the daughter has a cause of action against the woman.**\n  - This is incorrect because the quitclaim deed does not transfer any interest in the land to the daughter, and thus, the daughter does not have a legal claim to the land.\n\n- **B. Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.**\n  - This is incorrect because the mortgage company's legal claim is based on the original mortgage agreement, which the woman has not fulfilled. The quitclaim deed does not affect this.\n\n- **C. Both the daughter and the mortgage company have cause of action against the woman.**\n  - This is incorrect because the quitclaim deed does not transfer any interest in the land to the daughter, and the mortgage company's claim is based on the original mortgage agreement, which the woman has not fulfilled.\n\n- **D. Neither the daughter nor the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.**\n  - This is incorrect because the mortgage company's claim is based on the original mortgage agreement, which the woman has not fulfilled. The quitclaim deed does not affect this.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.**"
