They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, \"I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder.\" The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n"

The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Criminal Conspiracy**: The man and his brother agreed to commit murder, which constitutes criminal conspiracy. They planned and took steps towards the commission of murder, which is an overt act.\n\n2. **Attempteded Murder**: They took the strychnine to the neighbor, which is an overt act towards the commission of murder. Even though the neighbor refused to drink, the act of attempting to administer the poison constitutes an attempt to commit murder.\n\n3. **Friend's Responsibility**: The friend was involved in the planning and advice phase of the conspiracy. Since the friend refused to participate in the actual commission of the murder, they are guilty of criminal conspiracy but not of attempted murder.\n\nTherefore, the man and his brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder, while the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy."
