The POP will choose to protect the disabled.\n\nRawls' theory of justice, particularly his concept of the original position, emphasizes fairness and the protection of basic liberties and social primary goods. The POP would choose to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to develop their abilities and live a good life, which includes protecting vulnerable groups such as the disabled. This alignss with Rawls' emphasis on fairness and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms."
