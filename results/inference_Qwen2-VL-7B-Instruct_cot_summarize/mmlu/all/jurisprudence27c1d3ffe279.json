Cognitivism.\n\nCognitivism asserts that moral statements are true or false, and that there are objective moral truths that can be discovered through reason and evidence. This perspective directly challenges ethical relativism, which posits that moral values are subjective and culturally relative, and thus cannot be universally applied or judged as right or wrong. Cognitivism supports the idea that human rights are not merely culturally specific but have an objective basis that transcends cultural differences."
