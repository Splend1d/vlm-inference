The next door neighbor, Tony, shared a concrete driveway that ran between the two houses but was entirely on Mort's side of the property line. Tony had been using the driveway for the past 25 years, during which time three different owners bought and sold Mort's house. When Mort applied to refinance his loan, his appraiser found an old survey showing the accurate property boundaries. Upset, Mort filed a suit against Tony for trespass. What is the likely result?\n\nA. Mort will prevail in an action for trespass, because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\"\nB. Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious,\" since it was not widely known that he was on Mort's property.\nC. Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\nD. Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity.\n"

Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a person who has used a property in a particular way for a certain period of of time ( (often 20 years or more) may be able to establish a prescriptive easement, which grants them the right to continue using the property in that manner. This is known as \"prescriptive easement\" or \"prescriptive use.\" \n\nIn this case, if Tony has been using the driveway for the past 25 years, he may be able to establish a prescriptive easement, and therefore, Mort would not be able to prevent Tony from using the driveway."
