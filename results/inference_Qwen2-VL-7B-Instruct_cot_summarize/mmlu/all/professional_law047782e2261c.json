Both teams were staying at the same hotel. The assistant coach of one of the teams learned that the team captain of the other team was staying in the next room. In order to obtain information about the other team's strategy for the championship game, the assistant coach used electronic devices placed against the wall to listen to and record conversations between the team captain and his teammates. The assistant coach later bragged to others about having eavesdropped on the team captain, and the team captain eventually heard about what the assistant coach had done. If the team captain asserts a claim against the assistant coach for invasion of privacy, will the team captain prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the assistant coach was recording the conversation for the use and advantage of his team.\nB. Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\nC. No, because the assistant coach's electronic devices did not physically intrude into the team captain's room.\nD. No, because there was publication of the recorded conversations.\n"

Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\n\nThe team captain's assertion of a claim against the assistant coach for invasion of privacy is likely to be successful. The team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room, and the assistant coach's actions of recording conversations without the team captain's consent violated that expectation. The fact that the assistant coach braggeded about the eavesdropping and that the team captain eventually heard about it does not necessarily affect the validity of the invasion of privacy claim. The key issue is the unauthorized recording and the violation of privacy, not the subsequent disclosure of the information."
