The z-score for the 99th percentile is approximately 2.326 ( (this value can be found using a z-table or a statistical calculator).\n\nThe formula to find the z-score is:\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(X\\) is the value of interest ( (12 ounces in this case)\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the mean we are trying to find\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation ( (0.3 ounces)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[ \\mu = X - z \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ \\mu = 12 - 2.326 \\cdot 0.3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu = 12 - 0.6978 \\]\n\n\\[ \\mu \\approx 11.3022 \\]\n\nSo, the mean setting should be approximately 11.3022 ounces to ensure that a 12-ounce cup will overflow less than 1% of the time.\n\nThe closest option to this calculation is:\n\nB. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces"
