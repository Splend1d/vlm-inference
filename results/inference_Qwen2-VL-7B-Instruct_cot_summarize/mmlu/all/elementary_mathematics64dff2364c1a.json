In option D, all the factors (2, 2, 2, 3, and 11 are prime numbers, and the expression shows the number as a product of these prime numbers. \n\n- Option A includes 9, which is not a prime number ( (9 = 3 x 3).\n- Option B includes 2.5, which is not a prime number ( (2.5 = 5/2).\n- Option C includes 1, which is not a prime number.\n\nTherefore, only D is the correct answer."
