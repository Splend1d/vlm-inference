                    "text": "The correct answer is B. This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase.\n\nWhen potassium perchlorate (KClO4) dissolves in water, the process is exothermic, meaning it releases heat to the surroundings, which results in a lower temperature of the solution compared to the initial temperature of the components. However, the primary reason this process is spontaneous is due to the increase in entropy ( (disorder) of the system. \n\nIn the dissolution process, the solid KClO4 breaks down into its constituent ions (K+ and ClO4-), which increases the number of particles in the solution. This increase in the number of particles leads to an increase in entropy, making the process spontaneous."
