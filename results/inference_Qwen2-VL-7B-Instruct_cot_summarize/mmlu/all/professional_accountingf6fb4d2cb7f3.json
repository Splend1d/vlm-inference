Inventory and prepaid expenses are part of the current assets but not included in quick assets. Therefore, to find the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses, we subtract the quick assets from the total current assets:\n\\[ \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Quick Assets} = 966,000 - 322,000 = 644,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. $644,000"
