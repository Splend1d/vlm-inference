Non-excludability means that it is impossible or very costly to exclude people from consuming the good, even if they do not pay for it. Non-rivalry means that one person's consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for others. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional citizens is greater than zero.\n- This is not true for a pure public good. The marginal cost of providing an additional unit of a pure public good is zero because it is non-rivalrous.\n\nB. Consumers can be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it.\n- This is not true for a pure public good. The non-excludability characteristic means that consumers cannot be excluded from the benefits of the good.\n\nC. One more unit of a public good for some consumers means one less unit for other consumers.\n- This is not true for a pure public good. The non-rivalry characteristic means that one person's consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for others.\n\nD. The good cannot be divided into discrete units.\n- This is true for a pure public good. The non-rivalry characteristic means that the good cannot be divided into discrete units because it is non-rivalrous.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
