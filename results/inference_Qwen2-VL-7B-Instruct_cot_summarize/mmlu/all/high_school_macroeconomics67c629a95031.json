This leaves $800 to be lent out as new loans. However, when this new loan is deposited into another bank, the process repeats, with the new bank keeping 20% of the deposit as reserves and lending out the remaining 80% as new loans. This process continues until the initial deposit of of $1,000 has been lent out and redeposited multiple times.\n\nThe formula to calculate the total amount of money created in new loans after multiple redeposits is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Money Created} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Deposit}}{\\text{Reserve Requirement}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the initial deposit is $1,000 and the reserve requirement is 20% ( or 0.20 in decimal form. So, the calculation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Money Created} = \\frac{1000}{0.20} = 5000 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation represents the total amount of money that can be created in new loans after multiple redeposits, not the amount created in the first round. The amount created in the first round is $800, which is the amount that can be lent out after keeping 20% as reserves. The total amount of money created in new loans after multiple redeposits is $5,000, but this is not the amount created in the first round.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $4,000, which represents the total amount of money that can be created in new loans after multiple redeposits, not the amount created in the first round."
