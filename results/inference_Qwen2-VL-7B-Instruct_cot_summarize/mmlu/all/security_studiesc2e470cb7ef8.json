The 'energy security nexus' refers to the constant state of flux between energy supplies and levels of security that can be achieved by states that rely on these supplies.\nB. An 'energy security nexus' exists where two states directly contend for access to the same, often limited, energy resource, such as oil reserves.\nC. An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another.\nD. An 'energy security nexus' exists in the global system as a result of strategic planning by oil-rich states to ensure that the geographical distribution of supply and demand is not equal.\n"

This concept highlights the interdependence between energy resources and national security, as well as the geopolitical dynamics that arise from the distribution of energy supply and demand. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another."
