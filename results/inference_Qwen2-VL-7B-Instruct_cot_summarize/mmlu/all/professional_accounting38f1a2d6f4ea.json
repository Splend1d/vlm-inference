Assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained, the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year is closest to\n\nA. 11.5 percent.\nB. 15 percent.\nC. 26.5 percent.\nD. 13.53 percent.\n"

Interest rate on fund used: 10%\n2. Compensatory balance: 15% of $200,000 = $30,000\n3. Commitment fee: 1% of $300,000 ( (since the unused amount is $300,000 - $200,000 = $100,000) = $1,000\n\nEffective annual interest cost = ( (Interest on fund used + Compensatory balance + Commitment fee) / ( Amount borrowed\n\n= ( ($200,000 * 10%) + $30,000 + $1,000) / $200,000\n\n= ($20,000 + $30,000 + $1,000) / $200,000\n\n= $51,000 / $200,000\n\n= 0.255 or 25.5%\n\nTherefore, the effective annual interest cost is closest to 26.5 percent.\n\nThe answer is C."
