Therefore, the number of different values that can be represented with \\( n \\) flits is given by \\( 3^n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of flits.\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( 3^n \\geq 256 \\).\n\nLet's calculate the powers of 3 until we reach or exceed 256:\n\n1. \\( 3^1 = 3 \\)\n2. \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n3. \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n4. \\( 3^4 = 81 \\)\n5. \\( 3^5 = 243 \\)\n6. \\( 3^6 = 729 \\)\n\nWe can see that \\( 3^6 = 729 \\) is the first power of 3 that is greater than 256.\n\nTherefore, the number of flits required to represent at least 256 different values is 6.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 6"
