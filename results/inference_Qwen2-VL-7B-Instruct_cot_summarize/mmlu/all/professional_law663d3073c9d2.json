They arranged a meeting to purchase the secrets from an unscrupulous employee of the pharmaceutical company in the company's New York office. The person selling the \"secrets\" was an undercover FBI agent. The envelope that he held, with the word \"Confidential\" typed on the outside of it, contained various recipes and gardening tips. When the defendants turned over the money, they were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it was legally impossible to steal trade secrets when in fact there were no trade secrets in the envelope. Will the federal district court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, legal impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nB. Yes, factual impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nC. No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\nD. No, the defendants were guilty of conspiracy as a matter of law.\n"

No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\n\nExplanation: In the context of criminal conspiracy, the defense of legal impossibility is generally not applicable. Legal impossibility refers to a situation where the act itself cannot be performed due to legal prohibitions, whereas factual impossibility refers to a situation where the act cannot be performed due to factual circumstances. In this case, the defendants's actions were not legally impossible; they attempted to steal trade secrets, which is a criminal act regardless of whether the secrets were actually in the envelope. The fact that the \"secrets\" were gardening tips and not trade secrets does not negate the conspiracy to steal trade secrets. Therefore, the federal district court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss based on legal impossibility."
