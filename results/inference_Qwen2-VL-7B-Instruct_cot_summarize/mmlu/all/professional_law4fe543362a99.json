Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal?\n\nA. No, because the arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics and is a proper concern of the criminal law.\nB. No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does.\nC. Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nD. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n"

Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" while the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The conviction in this case is likely to be reversed on appeal because the statute in question criminalizes drug addiction itself, rather than the use of illegal drugs. This is considered a violation of the Eighth Amendment, as it amounts to punishing someone for having a medical condition, which is generally considered to be cruel and unusual punishment."
