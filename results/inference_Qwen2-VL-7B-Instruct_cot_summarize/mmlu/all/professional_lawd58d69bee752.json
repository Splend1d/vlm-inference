The loaves were to be delivered on the first day of each week, with payment to be made within four days of delivery. For the first four weeks, the bakery delivered loaves to the supermarket and the supermarket made the appropriate payments. When the fifth delivery arrived, the supermarket discovered that the shipment contained 80 whole wheat loaves and 20 sourdough loaves. The manager of the supermarket immediately called the bakery to complain about the shipment. The operator of the bakery apologized and offered to send 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours. What is the probable legal effect of the operator's conversation with the manager with regard to the fifth shipment?\n\nA. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment and cancel their contract.\nB. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment, but would be held liable for the remaining deliveries.\nC. The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure. \"\nD. The supermarket would have a right to \"cover\" by purchasing substitute loaves of bread.\n"

The supermarket would have a right to \"cover\" by purchasing substitute loaves of bread.\n\nIn contract law, when a party fails to perform their obligations under a contract, the other party may have the right to \"cover\" by purchasing substitute goods or services. In this case, the supermarket was entitled to receive 100 loaves of whole wheat bread per week, and the fifth shipment contained only 100 loaves of whole wheat bread (plus 20 sourdough loaves. The operator's offer to send 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours would likely be seen as an attempt to cover the breach of contract by providing the missing loaves. Therefore, the supermarket would have the right to accept the offer and cover the breach by purchasing the substitute loaves."
