This makes US goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, which can lead to an increase in exports. However, it also also makes foreign goods and services more expensive for US buyers, which can lead to a decrease in imports. \n\nTherefore, the overall effect on the trade balance (the difference between exports and imports - depends on the relative magnitudes of the changes in exports and imports. If the increase in exports is greater than the decrease in imports, the trade surplus will increase. If the decrease in imports is greater than the increase in exports, the trade surplus will decrease. If the changes in exports and imports are equal, the trade surplus will remain unchanged. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D. decrease a trade surplus."
