A solid waste processor sued the city in federal court claiming that the ordinance discriminated based on local economic protectionism. The city responded that the ordinance did not discriminate because it does not differentiate solid waste due to geographic origin. All solid waste, regardless of origin, must be processed and made environmentally safe at the transfer station before it leaves town. Will the federal court rule that the flow control ordinance is a discriminatory law against the free flow of interstate commerce?\n\nA. Yes, because it allows only the favored operator to process waste that is within the limits of the town, to the exclusion of outside processors who might be interested in getting some of the business.\nB. Yes, because it requires processors to come into the state to be allowed to do processing instead of being able receive the waste at their out-of-state location.\nC. No, because the city did not discriminate against anyone's waste, if it was in the city limits the state from where the material originated did not come into consideration.\nD. No, because the city simply wanted to assure that the solid waste leaving the area was not environmentally harmful.\n"
