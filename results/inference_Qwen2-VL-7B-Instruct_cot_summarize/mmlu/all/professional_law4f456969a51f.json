State law provided that if he tried to leave against medical advice, the hospital could hold him for 72 hours while trying to convince him to stay. During the stay, he told his medical providers that he was intensely angry at his wife, who was living with another man, and he wanted to harm her. Despite that knowledge, the hospital issued him an unrestricted weekend pass. When he got out he shot and killed his wife. The man's children sued the hospital for negligence. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss mainly because there was no privity with the decedent and no duty owed to her. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the hospital is strictly liable for releasing patients who it knows or should know represent an unreasonable danger to third persons.\nB. No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an in-patient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.\nC. Yes, because there is no duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others.\nD. Yes, because the intervening acts of third parties are unforeseeable and cannot give rise to liability.\n"

Privity refers to a direct relationship between two parties, which is necessary for a duty to exist. In this case, the decedent ( the man's wife who was killed by the man after he was released from the hospital - did not have a direct relationship with the hospital. The hospital's duty to the patient does not extend to third parties, particularly the patient's spouse, unless there is a special relationship or control over the patient's conduct.\n\nThe hospital's motion to dismiss is based on the argument that there was no duty owed to the decedent because she was not a patient and did not have a direct relationship with the hospital. The court is likely to agree with this argument, as the duty of care owed by the hospital is primarily to the patient and not to third parties, especially in the absence of a special relationship or control over the patient's conduct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because there is no duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others."
