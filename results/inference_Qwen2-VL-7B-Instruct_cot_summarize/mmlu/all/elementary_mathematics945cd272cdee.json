The value of the digit 5 in 24,513:\n   - The digit 5 is in the thousands place.\n   - The value of the digit 5 in the thousands place is \\(5 \\times 1,000 = 5,000\\).\n\n2. The value of the digit 5 in 357:\n   - The digit 5 is in the tens place.\n   - The value of the digit 5 in the tens place is \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\nNow, we compare the two values:\n- Value of of 5 in 24,513: 5,000\n- Value of of 5 in 357: 50\n\nTo find how many times the value of the digit 5 in 24,513 is the value of the digit 5 in 357, we divide the larger value by the smaller value:\n\\[ \\frac{{5,000}{50} = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the digit 5 in 24,513 is 100 times the value of the digit 5 in 357.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 100."
