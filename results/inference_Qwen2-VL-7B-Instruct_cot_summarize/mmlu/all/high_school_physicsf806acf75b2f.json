Lightly touch the guitar string in the middle such that a single node is created. Measure the length of the string; this is the wavelength.\nB. Measure the length of the guitar string; this is half the wavelength.\nC. Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard.

Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.\n\nThis method is based on the principle of resonance, where the length of the pipe ( (or any resonant cavity) is adjusted until it matches the wavelength of the sound wave. The difference between the lengths for consecutive resonances corresponds to half the wavelength of the sound wave."
