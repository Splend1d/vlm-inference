After an unanticipated zoning change increased the land's fair market value to $150,000 during the executory period, the owner refused to close. Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate. The investor paid the buyer $25,000. The investor knew of the owner's refusal to close, and the owner continued to refuse to close despite the investor's demands that he do so. The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD. The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n"

To determine who is likely to prevail, we need to analyze the legal principles involved, including the rights of assignees, the concept of specific performance, and the investor's status as an assignee.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Specific Performance**:\n   - Specific performance is an equitable remedy that requires a court to order a party to perform a specific act, such as transferring property as per a contract.\n   - It is typically granted when monetary damages are inadequate to compensate the non-breachinging party.\n\n2. **Assignee Rights**:\n   - An assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is generally entitled to specific performance if the assignee is a bona fide purchaser without notice of any defects in the title.\n   - The investor, having purchased the contract from the original buyer, is an assignee of the original party.\n\n3. **Zoning Change and Market Value**:\n   - The zoning change increased the land's fair market value, but this does not affect the enforceability of the original contract unless there is a clause in the contract that addresses such changes.\n   - The owner's refusal to close is a breach of contract, and the zoning change does not negate the owner's obligation to transfer the land.\n\n4. **Investor's Status**:\n   - The investor paid $25,000 for the contract, which is less than the original contract price of $100,000. This the investor is an arm's-length transaction, it is reasonable to assume that the investor is a bona fide assigneee without notice of any defects in the title.\n   - The investor's experience in buying and selling real estate does not negate their status as an assignee.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the above analysis, the investor is likely to prevail because:\n\n- The investor is an assignee of the original party purchaser and is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\n- The investor paid a fair price for the contract and is not aware of any defects in the title.\n- The owner's refusal to close is a breach of contract, and specific performance is an appropriate remedy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances."
