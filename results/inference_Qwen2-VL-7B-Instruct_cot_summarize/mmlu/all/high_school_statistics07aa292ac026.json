This can be found by subtractinging the probability of requesting both from the probability of requesting an oil change:\n\\[ P(O \\cap \\text{not } T) = P(O) - P(O \\cap T) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ P(O \\cap \\text{not } T) = 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( P(\\text{not } T | O) \\):\n\\[ P(\\text{not } T | O) = \\frac{0.50}{0.60} \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{not } T | O) = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not request tire replacements is approximately 0.833.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 0.833"
