According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him \"wandering aimlessly\", and at times \"suspiciously\" handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man's paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts. The officers made him sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived 20 minutes later. The man later produced receipts for the items and was released. He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?\n\nA. No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.\nB. No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.\nC. Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.\nD. Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n"

Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established - there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n\nThe court will likely allow the case to go to the jury because the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established. False imprisonment occurs when a person is intentionally confined without legal justification. In this case, the security officers detained the man without probable cause for an arrest, and he was confined in the hallway until the police arrived. This intentional confinement without legal justification is sufficient to establish false imprisonment."
