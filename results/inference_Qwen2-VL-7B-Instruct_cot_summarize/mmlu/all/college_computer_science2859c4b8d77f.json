Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.\n   - This statement is false. Both combinational and sequential circuits can have feedback. Feedback is a common feature in both types of circuits, especially in sequential circuits where feedback is used to store information.\n\n ii. Combinational circuits have a \"memoryless\" property; sequential circuits do not.\n   - This statement is true. Combinational circuits do not have memory; their output depends solely on the current inputs. Sequential circuits, on the other hand, do have memory; their output depends on both the current inputs and the previous state of the circuit.\n\n iii. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\n   - This statement is false. While many sequential circuits are controlled by an external clock, there are also asynchronous sequential circuits that do not require an external clock.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
