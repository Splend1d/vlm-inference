The great generosity of God! The happiness of man! To man it is allowed to be whatever he chooses to be!\"\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Pico della Mirandola believes that human beings are unique because they have the potential to be whatever they choose to be. This implies that human beings have the capacity for unlimited potential.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\nA. Human beings have a soul - While this is a common belief, it is not explicitly mentioned in the passage.\nB. Human beings know that they will die - This is not mentioned in the passage.\nC. It is possible for human beings to go to heaven - This is not mentioned in the passage.\nD. The potential of the human being is unlimited - This aligns with the passage's emphasis on the freedom and potential of human beings.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting inference is:\n\nD. The potential of the human being is unlimited\n\nFinal answer: D. The potential of the human being is unlimited"
