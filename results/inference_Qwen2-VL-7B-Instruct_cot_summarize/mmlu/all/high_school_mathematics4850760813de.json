The slope of a line given by the equation \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\) can be found by rearranging the equation into the slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope.\n\nFor the first line, \\(x + 2y + 3 = 0\\), we rearrange it to find the slope:\n\\[2y = -x - 3\\]\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\\]\nSo, the slope of the first line is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nFor the second line, \\(ax + 2y + 3 = 0\\), we rearrange it to find the slope:\n\\[2y = -ax - 3\\]\n\\[y = -\\frac{a}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}\\]\nSo, the slope of the second line is \\(-\\frac{a}{2}\\).\n\nTwo lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\). Therefore, we set the product of the slopes equal to \\(-1\\) and solve for \\(a\\):\n\\[-\\frac{1}{2} \\times -\\frac{a}{2} = -1\\]\n\\[\\frac{a}{4} = -1\\]\n\\[a = -4\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(a\\) is \\(-4\\), which corresponds to option A."
