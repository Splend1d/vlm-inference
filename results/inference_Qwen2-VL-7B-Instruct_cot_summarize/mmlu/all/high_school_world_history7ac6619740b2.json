The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe passage above is most associated with which of the following developments?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which development the passage is most associated with, let's analyze the content and context of the passage.\n\nThe passage emphasizes the importance of peace and the role of the peoples of Asia and Africa in promoting peace. It mentions the need to inject the voice of reason into world affairs and mobilize all available strengths on the side of peace. This suggests a focus on international cooperation and the promotion of peace and stability.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement\n- The non-aligned movement was a group of countries that did not align with either the Western or Eastern blocs during the Cold War. This movement was indeed focused on promoting peace and neutrality in international affairs, which aligns with the passage's emphasis on peace and reason.\n\nB. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation\n- While global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are important aspects of peace, the passage does not specifically mention disarmament or nuclear proliferation. It focuses more broadly on the need for peace and the role of Asia and Africa in promoting it.\n\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture\n- The Green Revolution refers to a period of agricultural development in the 1960s that led to increased food production in developing countries. This is not related to the passage's focus on peace and international cooperation.\n\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology\n- While the passage does mention the mobilization of strength on the side of peace, it does not specifically mention pan-Asian ideology. The focus is more on the role of Asia and Africa in promoting peace rather than a specific ideology.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage is most closely associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement.\n\nFinal answer: A. The formation of the non-aligned movement"
