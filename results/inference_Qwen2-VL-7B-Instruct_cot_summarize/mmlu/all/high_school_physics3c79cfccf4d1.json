The forces balance will involve the normal force \\( N \\) from the wall, the friction force \\( f \\), and the centripetal force \\( \\frac{mv^2}{R} \\).\n\n1. **Centripetal Force**:\n   The centripetal force required to keep the person moving in a circular path is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{mv^2}{R}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Friction Force**:\n   The friction force \\( f \\) between the person's clothing and the wall must be sufficient to balance the centripetal force:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{mv^2}{R}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Normal Force**:\n   The normal force \\( N \\) from the wall must be equal to the weight of the person:\n   \\[\n   N = mg\n   \\]\n\n4. **Maximum Friction Force**:\n   The maximum friction force \\( f_{\\text{max}} \\) is given by the coefficient of friction \\( \\mu \\) times the normal force \\( N \\):\n   \\[\n   f_{\\text{max}} = \\mu N = \\mu mg\n   \\]\n\n5. **Equating Friction and Centripetal Force**:\n   For the person to remain in place, the friction force must be equal to the centripetal force:\n   \\[\n   \\mu mg = \\frac{mv^2}{R}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for Mass**:\n   Rearrange the equation to solve for the mass \\( m \\):\n   \\[\n   mg = \\frac{mv^2}{R} \\implies g = \\frac{v^2}{R} \\implies m = \\frac{v^2}{gR}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Check the Options**:\n   - Option A: \\( \\frac{\\mu v^2}{rg} \\)\n   - Option B: \\( \\frac{r^2 v^2}{\\mu g} \\)\n   - Option C: \\( \\frac{rg}{\\mu v^2} \\)\n\n   Comparinging the derived expression with the options, we see that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{v^2}{gR} \\neq \\frac{\\mu v^2}{rg} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{r^2 v^2}{\\mu g} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{rg}{\\mu v^2}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
