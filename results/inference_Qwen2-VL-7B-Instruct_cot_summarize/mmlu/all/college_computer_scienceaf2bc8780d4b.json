When you push an element onto a stack, the stack is not empty anymore. Therefore, `IsEmpty(Stack)` should return `false` after a push operation.\n\nB. `Pop(Push(Stack,Elem)) = Stack`\n   - This is incorrect. After pushing an element onto the stack, the `Pop` operation removes the top element from the stack. The stack itself is modified, so `Stack` after `Pop` should not be the same as `Stack` before `Push`.\n\nC. `Top(Push(Stack,Elem)) = Elem`\n   - This is correct. After pushing an element onto the stack, the `Top` operation should return the element that was just pushed.\n\nD. `IsEmpty(Push(Push(Stack,Elem1),Elem2)) = false`\n   - This is correct. After pushing two elements onto the stack, the `IsEmpty` operation should return `false` because the stack is not empty.\n\nTherefore, the equation that does NOT represent the conventional semantics of a stack is:\n\nA. `IsEmpty(Push(Stack,Elem)) = true`"
