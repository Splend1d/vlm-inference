Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. If the co-defendants are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.\nB. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\nC. Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.\nD. Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n"

Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Murder**: The co-defendants are guilty of murder because they caused the death of 30 people by placing a bomb in the bank and detonating it. This is a direct result of their actions, and the deaths were foreseeable consequences of their plan.\n\n2. **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**: The co-defendants are also guilty of conspiracy to commit murder because they conspired to kill the bank's employees or customers. They planned and coordinated the act of placing the bomb in the bank with the intent to cause death.\n\nTherefore, both co-defendants are guilty of both murder and conspiracy to commit murder."
