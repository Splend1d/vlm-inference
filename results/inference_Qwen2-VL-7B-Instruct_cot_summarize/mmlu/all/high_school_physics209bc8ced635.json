                    "text": "To determine which statements are true, let's analyze the motion of the whiffle ball under the influence of air resistance.\n\n1. **The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.**\n   - At the highest point, the ball momentarily stops before it starts falling back down. Therefore, the speed is indeed zero at this point.\n\n2. **The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.**\n   - At the highest point, the ball is momentarily stationary. However, the acceleration due to gravity ( \\( g \\) is still acting downward, and air resistance is also acting upward. The net acceleration is not zero because these two forces are not balanced. Therefore, the acceleration is not zero at the highest point.\n\n3. **The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.**\n   - Due to air resistance, the ball experiences a deceleration on the way up, which reduces its upward velocity. On the way down, the ball accelerates due to gravity, but air resistance acts to slow it down. This means the ball will take longer to reach the highest point than to fall back down because the net effect of air resistance is to slow the ball down more on the way up than it speeds it up on the way down.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I & III only**"
