Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Transcription:**\n   - The DNA sequence is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032.\n   - Transcription produces mRNA by complementary base pairing: \n     - C in DNA pairs with G in mRNA ( (5\u2032-G-A-U-3\u2032)\n     - A in DNA pairs with U in mRNA ( (5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032)\n     - T in DNA pairs with A in mRNA ( (5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032)\n\n2. **Translation:**\n   - The mRNA sequence is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032.\n   - The tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon.\n   - The anticodon of tRNA pairs with the mRNA codon by complementary base pairing.\n\n3. **Anticodon Base Pairing:**\n   - The mRNA codon is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032.\n   - The complementary base pairing for this mRNA codon is:\n     - G in mRNA pairs with C in tRNA (5\u2032-C-G-U-3\u2032)\n     - U in mRNA pairs with A in tRNA ( (5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032)\n     - A in mRNA pairs with U in tRNA ( (5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032)\n\nTherefore, the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon is 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032"
