If an element \\( a \\) has order 15, it means \\( a^{15} = e \\) and \\( a^k \\neq e \\) for \\( 1 \\le k \\le 14 \\).\n\nHowever, the statement that \"it must have at least 8 elements of order 15\" is not necessarily true. The presence of one element of order 15 does not imply that there must be at least 8 more elements of the same order. The structure of the group and the nature of the elements can vary widely. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Statement 2\n\"If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\"\n\nThis statement is also not necessarily true. The number of elements of a particular order in a group is not necessarily related to the number of elements of the same order in another group. The structure of the group and the relationships between its elements can vary widely. Therefore, this statement is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
