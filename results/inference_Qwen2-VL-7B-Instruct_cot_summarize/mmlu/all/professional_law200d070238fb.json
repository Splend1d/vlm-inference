To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue \"cease and desist\" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who \"intentionally engaged in price gouging. \" In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?\n\nA. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.\nB. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\nC.

Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\n"

Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U.S. Attorney General or the courts.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle of the separation of powers, which is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution establishes three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. The legislative branch (Congress) is responsible for making laws, the executive branch (the President and his executive agencies) is responsible for enforcing those laws, and the judicial branch (the courts) is responsible for interpreting and applying the laws.\n\nThe argument here is that Congress cannot delegate the power to enforce federal laws to any governmental body other than the U.S. Attorney General or the courts. This is because the power to enforce laws is a core function of the executive branch, and it would be unconstitutional for Congress to give this power to another branch or to a private entity like the agency in question.\n\nThe other options are not as strong constitutional arguments:\n\nA. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.\n- While this is a valid argument, it is not as strong as the separation of powers argument. The power to interpret laws is a core function of the judicial branch, but it is not as fundamental as the power to enforce laws.\n\nB. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\n- This is also a valid argument, but it is not as strong as the separation of powers argument. The power to make \"cease and desist\" orders is a core function of the executive branch, but it is not as fundamental as the power to enforce laws.\n\nD. Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of of members of such an agency.\n- This is also a valid argument, but it is not as strong as the separation of powers argument. The power to appoint members of an agency is a core function of the executive branch, but it is not as fundamental as the power to enforce laws."
