Symbolic culture refers to the transmission of knowledge through language, symbols, and other cultural artifacts.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. A young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand.\n- This example involves learning a behavior through observation and imitation, which is a form of cultural transmission. However, it does not involve symbolic culture because it is not based on language or symbols.\n\nII. A child learning the rules of baseball from a parent.\n- This example involves learning rules through verbal communication, which is a form of symbolic culture.\n\nIII. A new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits.\n- This example involves learning rituals and practices through verbal and symbolic communication, which is a form of symbolic culture.\n\nBased on this analysis, the example that does not involve symbolic culture is:\n\nI. A young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only"
