The particles must have the same sign of charge.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The net force between two charged particles depends on the magnitude and direction of their charges. If the charges have opposite signs, the net force can still be zero if they are equal in magnitude. Therefore, it is possible for the particles to have opposite charges and still have a net force of 0 N.\n\nB. If the distance between the particles changes, the force will no longer be 0 N.\n- This statement is true. The force between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them ( (F \u221d 1/r\u00b2). If the distance changes, the force will change accordingly.\n\nC. The particles must have the same mass.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The mass of the particles does not affect the net force between them. The net force depends only on the charges and their separation distance.\n\nD. Such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0.\n- This statement is not true. It is possible for the net force between two charged particles to be 0 N, as mentioned in option A. For example, if the particles have opposite charges and are equal in magnitude, the net force can be zero.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\nC. The particles must have the same mass."
