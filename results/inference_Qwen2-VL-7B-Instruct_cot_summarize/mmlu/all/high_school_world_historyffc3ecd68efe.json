They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nThe description of the route Portuguese sailors took in the first paragraph most directly supports which of the following historical developments?\n\nA. Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade\nB. Competition between Dutch and Portuguese traders for markets in Japan\nC. European participation in East Asian trade patterns\nD. Jesuit missionary work in Japan and China\n"
