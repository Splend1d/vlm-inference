It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude\n\nThe leverage effect refers to the phenomenon where the volatility of a financial asset increases more in response to negative news than to positive news of of the same magnitude. This means that the impact curve would show a steeper rise for negative disturbances compared to positive ones."
