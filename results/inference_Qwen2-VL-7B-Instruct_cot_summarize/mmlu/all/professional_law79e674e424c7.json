In many jurisdictions, statements made in the immediate aftermath of a startling event, such as a robbery or shooting, are considered to be spontaneous and unreflective of the speaker's state of mind at the time of speaking. Therefore, such statements are generally considered to be admissible as they are less likely to be fabricated or influenced by the declarant's desire to mislead or conceal.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the admissibility of the bystander's testimony would ultimately depend on the specific rules and standards of the jurisdiction in which the trial is taking place."
