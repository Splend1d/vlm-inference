The code iterates through each `item` in `inputList1`.\n2. For each `item`, it checks if `item` is found in `inputList2` using the `isFound` procedure.\n3. If `item` is found in `inputList2`, it is appended to `resultList`.\n\nGiven this logic, `resultList` will contain elements from `inputList1` that are also found in `inputList2`.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
