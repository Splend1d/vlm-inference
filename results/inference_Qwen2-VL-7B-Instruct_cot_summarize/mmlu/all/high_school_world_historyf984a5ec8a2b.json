The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To solve this logic reasoning problem, we need to identify the common trait among classical empires as described in the passage. The passage discusses the decline of Rome and mentions several factors contributing to its downfall, including the assimilation of conquered peoples, the corruption of military discipline, and the integration of foreign religions. Let's analyze each option in the context of the passage:\n\nA. **They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.**\n   - The passage mentions that the victorious legions, who acquired vices from strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic and later violated the majesty of the purple. This implies that the assimilation of conquered peoples was a contributing factor to Rome's decline.\n\nB. **They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.**\n   - The passage does not explicitly mention state support of foreign religions. It focuses more on military discipline and the assimilation of conquered peoples.\n\nC. **They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.**\n   - The passage does not mention widespread public works projects as a contributing factor to the decline of Rome. It focuses more on military discipline and cultural assimilation.\n\nD. **They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.**\n   - The passage does not discuss the merit principle in government bureaucracies. It focuses more on military discipline and cultural assimilation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most relevant trait shared by classical empires, as described in the passage, is the assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\n\nFinal answer: A. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire."
