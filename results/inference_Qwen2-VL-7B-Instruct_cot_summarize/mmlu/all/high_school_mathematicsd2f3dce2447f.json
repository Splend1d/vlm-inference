Then, we'll use the given \\( y = 4 \\) to find the corresponding \\( t \\) value, and finally, we'll use the slope and the point to find the equation of the tangent line.\n\nThe curve is given by:\n\\[ F(t) = (t^2 + 1, 2^t) \\]\n\nThe derivative of \\( F(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is:\n\\[ F'(t) = 2t + 2^t \\ln(2) \\]\n\nTo find the slope of the tangent line at the point where \\( y = 4 \\), we need to find the \\( t \\) value that makes \\( F(t) \\) equal to \\( 4 \\). We have:\n\\[ t^2 + 2^t = 4 \\]\n\nThis equation is not easily solvable algebraically, but we can guess and check or use numerical methods to find that \\( t = 2 \\) is a solution since \\( 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8 \\), which is not correct. Let's correct this step:\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that \\( y = 4 \\) corresponds to the second component of \\( F(t) \\), which is \\( 2^t \\). So, we set \\( 2^t = 4 \\) and solve for \\( t \\):\n\\[ 2^t = 4 \\]\n\\[ 2^t = 2^2 \\]\n\\[ t = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we find the slope of the tangent line at \\( t = 2 \\):\n\\[ F'(2) = 2(2 + 2^2 \\ln(2) = 4 + 4\\ln(2) \\]\n\nThe slope of the tangent line is \\( 4 + 4\\ln(2) \\).\n\nNext, we find the point on the curve where \\( y = 4 \\). Since \\( 2^t = 4 \\) at \\( t = 2 \\), the point is \\( (2^2 + 1, 2^2) = (3, 4) \\).\n\nThe equation of the tangent line at this point is given by:\n\\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\]\n\nWhere \\( (x_1, y_1) = (3, 4) \\) and \\( m = 4 + 4\\ln(2) \\).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ y - 4 = (4 + 4\\ln(2)(x - 3) \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[ y - 4 = 4(x - 3) + 4\\ln(2)(x - 3) \\]\n\\[ y - 4 = 4x - 12 + 4\\ln(2x - 12\\ln(2)) \\]\n\\[ y - 4 = 4x - 12 + 4\\ln(2(x - 3)) \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\[ y - 4 = 4\\ln(2)(x - 3) \\]\n\nThis matches option D: \\( y - 4 = \\ln(2)(x - 5) \\), but it seems there was a misunderstanding in the simplification process. The correct simplification should align with the correct slope and point, which is actually:\n\\[ y - 4 = 4\\ln(2)(x - 2) \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ y - 4 = 4\\ln(2)(x - 2) \\]\n\nThis matches option B: \\( y - 4 = 4\\ln(2)(x - 2) \\)."
