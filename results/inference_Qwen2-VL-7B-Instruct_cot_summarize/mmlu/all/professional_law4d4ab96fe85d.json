The manufacturer answered, denying all liability and stating that it had never supplied its insulation to the worker's employer. The worker's attorney deposed the manufacturer's president, and the manufacturer's attorney deposed the worker. Immediately thereafter, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the worker had no evidence showing that the insulation had ever been used by the worker's employer. What would be the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment?\n\nA. Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.\nB. Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\nC. Argue that the motion should be denied, because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.\nD. Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.\n"

Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\n\nThis response is the most appropriate because it addresses the core issue of the case, which is the credibility of the manufacturer's denial of supplying the insulation to the worker's employer. By arguing that the jury can decide questions of credibility, the worker's attorney acknowledges the need for a trial but also also emphasizes the importance of allowing the jury to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter. This approach is consistent with the legal principle that questions of credibility are generally for the jury to decide, and it avoids the pitfalls of arguing for additional time or for summary judgment on the manufacturer's side."
