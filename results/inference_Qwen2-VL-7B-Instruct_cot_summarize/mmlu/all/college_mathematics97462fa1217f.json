In this case, the line perpendicular to the plane is the normal vector of the plane, which is \\(\\vec{n} = (2, 1, 3\\).\n\nThe equation of the plane can be rewritten as \\(2x + y + 3z - 3 = 0\\), where \\(a\\) is a scalar. The normal vector of the plane is \\(\\vec{n} = (2, 1, 3\\), and the point on the plane closest to the origin is the point where the line through the origin and parallel to the normal vector intersects the plane.\n\nThe equation of the line through the origin and parallel to the normal vector is given by:\n\\[x = 2t, y = t, z = 3t\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is a scalar.\n\nSubstituting the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane:\n\\[2(2t) + t + 3(3t) = 3\\]\n\\[4t + t + 9t = 3\\]\n\\[14t = 3\\]\n\\[t = \\frac{3}{14}\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(t = \\frac{3}{14}\\) back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the point:\n\\[x = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{14}\\right) = \\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7}\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{3}{14}\\]\n\\[z = 3\\left(\\frac{3}{14}\\right) = \\frac{9}{14}\\]\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the point on the plane \\(2x + y + 3z = 3\\) that is closest to the origin are \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{3}{14}, \\frac{9}{14}\\right)\\), which corresponds to option B."
