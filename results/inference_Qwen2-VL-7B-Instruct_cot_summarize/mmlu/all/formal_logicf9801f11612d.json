G \u2283 F\n3. H \u2228 ~E\n4. H \u2283 I\n5. ~I\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n### Option A: E \u2283 F\n- From premise 1: ~E \u2283 ~F\n- This does not directly imply E \u2283 F. Instead, it implies that if E is true, then F must be false. This is not a direct consequence.\n\n### Option B: F \u2283 G\n- From premise 2: G \u2283 F\n- This does not directly imply F \u2283 G. Instead, it implies that if G is true, then F must be true. This is not a direct consequence.\n\n### Option C: H \u2283 ~E\n- From premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n- This does not directly imply H \u2283 ~E. Instead, it implies that either H is true or ~E is true. This is not a direct consequence.\n\n### Option D: ~H\n- From premise 3: H \u2228 ~E\n- This does not directly imply ~H. Instead, it implies that either H is true or ~E is true. This is not a direct consequence.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the given options directly follow as an immediate consequence from the given premises. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the above**"
