Whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing.\n\nIn the context of age discrimination, evidence of age discrimination in the firing of an employee exists when the employee's age, rather than their work performance, is the basis for the decision to terminate their employment. This is in accordance with the Age Discriminationion Act (1975 ( (ADA), which prohibits employment discrimination based on age. The act protects individuals aged 40 or older from discrimination in employment, including hiring, firing, and other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are not accurate because:\n- Option A is too narrow and does not cover all cases of age discrimination.\n- Option C focuses on economic loss, which is not the primary criterion for proving age discrimination.\n- Option D is also not specific enough and does not align with the legal standards set by the ADA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
