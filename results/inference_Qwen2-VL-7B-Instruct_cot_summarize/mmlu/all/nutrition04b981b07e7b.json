Fatty acids can be made from and converted to carbohydrates and amino acids.\n\nThis statement reflects the central role of metabolic pathways in interconverting various types of fuels within the body. Fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids are all essential components of cellular metabolism, and the body can convert between them as needed to meet energy demands and support various physiological functions. This interconversion is a fundamental aspect of how the body manages its energy resources."
