It is represented as 0.010101010101... in binary.\n   - Therefore, 0.1 does not have an exact representation in binary.\n\n2. **Option B: 0.2**\n   - The decimal number 0.2 is also a repeating fraction in binary. It is represented as 0.001100110011... in binary.\n   - Therefore, 0.2 does not have an exact representation in binary.\n\n3. **Option C: 0.3**\n   - The decimal number 0.3 is also a repeating fraction in binary. It is represented as 0.01001001001001... in binary.\n   - Therefore, 0.3 does not have an exact representation in binary.\n\n4. **Option D: 0.5**\n   - The decimal number 0.5 is a simple fraction in binary. It is represented as 0.1 in binary.\n   - Therefore, 0.5 has an exact representation in binary.\n\nThus, the decimal number that has an exact representation in binary notation is:\n\n**D. 0.5**"
