After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt. If the court rules in favor of the mechanic, which of the following is the most likely cause for such a ruling?\n\nA. The writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.\nB. The writing was construed as a partial integration of the parties' agreement.\nC. An implied-in-law contract was created at the moment the mechanic replaced the worn belt.\nD. The parties entered into a collateral oral agreement for the replacement of the worn belt that was excludable from the integrated writing.\n"

The write was construed as a complete integration of the parties's agreement.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of contract interpretation, particularly the parol evidence rule, which generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict, vary, or add to the terms of a written contract. If the court finds that the written contract is a complete integration of the parties's agreement, then any oral agreements made at the time of the contract formation would not be considered as part of the contract and would not be enforceable.\n\nIn this scenario, the mechanic's oral agreement to replace the worn belt for an additional $100 would not be enforceable because it was not included in the written contract. The court would likely rule that the written contract is the final and complete agreement between the parties, and any additional work performed beyond what was specified in the contract would not be covered by the $1,000 fee."
