This can be assessed by comparing the foetus's weight to the average weight for a foetus of the same gestational age. If the foetus's weight is significantly below the average for its gestational age, it is considered to have IUGR.\n\nLow birthweight (LBW) refers to a foetus that weighs less than 2500 grams at birth. Very low birthweight (VLBW) refers to a foetus that weighs less than 1500 grams at birth. Pre-term birth refers to a foetus that is born before 37 weeks of gestation. These terms are related to birth weight but do not specifically refer to the growth of the foetus during pregnancy."
