                    "text": "The Doppler effect is a phenomenon that describes the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. The perceived frequency of the wave is higher when the source and observer are approaching each other and lower when they are moving away from each other. This effect is observed in various types of waves, including sound waves.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The source travels toward the stationary detector.**\n   - In this scenario, the source is moving towards the detector, which means the frequency of the sound waves will increase as they reach the detector. Therefore, there will be a perceived Doppler shift.\n\nB. **The detector travels toward the stationary source.**\n   - Similarly, if the detector is moving towards the source, the frequency of the sound waves will also increase as they reach the detector. Thus, there will be a perceived Doppler shift.\n\nC. **Both the source and detector travel in the same direction.**\n   - When both the source and detector are moving in the same direction, the waves will continue to move in the same direction without changing their frequency. Therefore, there will be no perceived Doppler shift.\n\nD. **Both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other.**\n   - If the source and detector are moving away from each other, the frequency of the sound waves will decrease as they reach the detector. Hence, there will be a perceived Doppler shift.\n\nGiven this analysis, the situation in which there is no perceived Doppler shift is:\n\n**C. Both the source and detector travel in the same direction.**"
