Rachel's argument revolves around the moral implications of active and passive euthanasia.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. \"Both active and passive euthanasia involve the intentional termination of a human life with dignity; therefore, both are morally wrong.\"\n- This option suggests that both active and passive euthanasia are morally wrong because they both involve the intentional termination of a human life with dignity. This implies that the act of ending life is inherently wrong, regardless of the method.\n\nB. \"Neither active nor passive euthanasia involves the intentional termination of a human life with dignity; therefore, both are morally permissible.\"\n- This option suggests that neither active nor passive euthanasia is morally permissible because they both involve the intentional termination of a human life. This implies that the act of ending life is inherently wrong, regardless of the method.\n\nC. \"There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia.\"\n- This option suggests that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die, which implies that there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia. This implies that the act of ending life is morally neutral, and thus, both active and passive euthanasia are morally permissible.\n\nD. \"There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, both active and passive euthanasia are morally wrong.\"\n- This option suggest that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die, which implies that there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia. This implies that the act of ending life is morally neutral, and thus, both active and passive euthanasia are morally wrong.\n\nGiven the analysis, option C best characterizes Rachel's's argument because it explicitly states that there is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die, which implies that there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia.\n\nTherefore, the best characterization of Rachel's argument is:\n\nC. \"There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia.\""
