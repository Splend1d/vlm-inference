The chemical was stored in a state-of-the- art tank on the site before being moved to an off-site disposal facility. The on-site storage arrangement conformed to the requirements of reasonable care and to the applicable government regulations. However, the storage of the toxic chemical created a foreseeable and highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised. Despite the chemical company's proper use and care of the storage tank, toxic fumes escaped from the tank and made residents of the area seriously ill. No state or federal statutes address the issue of the company's liability. In an action by one of the affected residents against the chemical company, will the resident be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the chemical company conformed to the requirements of reasonable care and to the applicable government regulations.\nB. No, because the chemical company used a state-of-the-art storage tank.\nC. Yes, because the chemical company is strictly liable in tort for any harm caused by the toxic chemicals it produced.\nD. Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.\n"

Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.\n\nIn tort law, the concept of \"strict liability\" can apply to certain situations, particularly when the defendant's conduct is deemed to be inherently dangerous or when the plaintiff can show that the defendant's actions were so unreasonable that they should be held liable regardless of fault. In this case, the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community, even when the company exercised reasonable care and complied with applicable regulations, created a highly significant risk of physical harm. This situation may fall under the category of strict liability, where the plaintiff can prevail in an action against the chemical company for the harm caused by the toxic fumes."
