He crashed into the rear of the woman's car and pushed her onto the curb and into a tree. When the plaintiff got out of her car, she felt fine physically, but was emotionally upset when she saw that the hood and trunk of her car were severely damaged. The next day she received an estimate from the mechanic for $1,950 to repair her car. She consulted an attorney the following afternoon and, that evening, suddenly developed shooting back pains. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the defendant based on a theory of negligence. One day prior to trial, two years after the accident, the plaintiff went to take a photograph of the accident scene. At trial, the photograph is\n\nA. inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph is non-verbal hearsay.\nB. inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph was taken two years after the accident.\nC. admissible, if the plaintiff identifies the photograph at trial.\nD. admissible, if the photograph correctly and accurately portrayed the accident scene.\n"

The admissibility of the photograph would depend on its ability to provide relevant and reliable evidence to the court. The fact that the photograph was taken two years after the accident does not automatically render it inadmissible, as long as it is not misleading or inaccurate. The plaintiff's attorney would need to establish that the photograph is a true and accurate representation of the accident scene."
