No matter how the population is distributed, as the sample size increases, the mean of the sample means becomes closer to the mean of the population.\n\nThis statement captures the essence of the central limit theorem, which asserts that the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution as the sample size grows, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is a fundamental concept in statistics, particularly in inferential statistics, where it allows us to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data."
