The mass of the ball does not affect the period of the pendulum.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Increasing the mass of the ball: The period of the pendulum is not affected by the mass of the ball.\n\nB. Decreasing the length of the string: Decreasing the length of the string would increase the period of the pendulum, not decrease it.\n\nC. Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released: The period of a pendulum is independent of the angle of release. The period is determined by the length of the string and the gravitational acceleration.\n\nD. Decreasing the mass of the ball: The period of the pendulum is not affected by the mass of the ball.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options would decrease the period of the pendulum. The correct answer is:\n\nNone of the above"
