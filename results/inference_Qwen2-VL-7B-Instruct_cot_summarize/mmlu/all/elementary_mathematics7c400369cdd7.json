Since the buses start their routes at 6:00 a.m., we add 75 minutes to 6:00 a.m. to find the next time they will leave at the same time.\n\n6:00 a.m. + 75 minutes = 7:15 a.m.\n\nTherefore, the next time both buses will leave the bus station at the same time is 7:15 a.m.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 7:15 a.m."
