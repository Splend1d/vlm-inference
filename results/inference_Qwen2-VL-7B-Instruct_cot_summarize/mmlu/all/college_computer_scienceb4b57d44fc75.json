This means that for any vertex v, there cannot be a directed path from v to itself. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges ( (i.e., a source vertex).\n\nII. **G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.**\n   - Similarly, in a directed acyclic graph, there are no cycles. This means that for any vertex v, there cannot be a directed path from itself to any other vertex. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with no outgoing edges ( (i.e., a sink vertex).\n\nIII. **G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge.**\n   - An isolated vertex in a directed graph would imply the existence of a cycle, which contradicts the definition of a directed acyclic graph. Therefore, an isolated vertex cannot exist in a directed acyclic graph.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that statements I and II must be true, while statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and II only**"
