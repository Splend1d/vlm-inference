Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nThe Aurignacian technology, which is associated with the Aurignacian culture, was characterized by the production of more usable blade surfaces compared to the Mousterian technology. This is evident in the use of Levalloisian techniques, which allowed for the production of a large number of blades from a single core. This technique was more efficient and allowed for the production of more usable blades, which were often used as tools or in the production of other artifacts."
