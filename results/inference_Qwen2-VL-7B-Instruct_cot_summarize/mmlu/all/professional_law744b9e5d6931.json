The contract contained a provision that clearly stated: \"This contract may not be assigned, and any violation of this prohibition voids the contract.\" After the contract was signed, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor of the seller. Citing the non-assignment provision, the buyer claimed that it was no longer bound by the contract. Toasters manufactured by the competitor were of equal quality to toasters manufactured by the seller. Is the buyer bound by the contract?\n\nA. No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.\nB. No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.\nC. Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters.\nD. Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.\n"

Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.\n\nIn contract law, the principle of freedom of contract generally allows parties to agree on the terms of their contract, including restrictions on assignment. However, public policy considerations often intervene to protect against certain types of assignments that could be detrimental to the other party or the public interest. The non-assignment clause in this contract is a restriction on the seller's ability to assign the contract, which is generally enforceable. However, public policy favors the freedom of contract and the ability to assign contracts, especially in commercial transactions, unless there is a compelling reason to prevent it.\n\nIn this case, the seller's assignment of the manufacturing duty to a competitor does not violate the public policy interest in freedom of contract. The toasters manufactured by the competitor are of equal quality, and there are no damages to the buyer. Therefore, the buyer is bound by the contract.\n\nSo, the buyer is bound by the contract."
