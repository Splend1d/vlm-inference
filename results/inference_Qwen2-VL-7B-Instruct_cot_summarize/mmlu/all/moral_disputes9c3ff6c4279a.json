However, since the specific text or reference to Macedo's work is not provided, we will analyze the options based on general principles of social ethics and international law.\n\nA. Duties of fair dealing ( e.g., nonexploitation - This is a common duty that societies have toward nonmembers, ensuring that nonmembers are not exploited.\n\nB. Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties e.g., ensuring that everyone has equal wealth - This is not a typical duty that societies have toward nonmembers. Wealth distribution is generally considered a domestic issue, managed by individual countries or regions, rather than a duty imposed by international society.\n\nC. Duties of rectification and redress e.g., redressing those who were oppressed - This is a duty that societies have toward nonmembers, ensuring that oppressed individuals are compensated or helped.\n\nD. Humanitarian duties e.g., preventing systematic violations of human rights - This is a duty that societies have toward nonmembers, ensuring that human rights are protected globally.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is not mentioned by Macedo as a duty that societies have toward nonmembers is:\n\nB. cosmopolitan egalitarian duties e.g., ensuring that everyone has equal wealth"
