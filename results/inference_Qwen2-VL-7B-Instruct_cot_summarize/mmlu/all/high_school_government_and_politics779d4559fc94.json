The preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act\n\nThe preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act is designed to prevent states with a history of racial discrimination from enacting voting laws that would disenfranchise minority voters. It is not directly related to voter turnout but rather to the enforcement of voting rights. Low voter turnout is more likely to be influenced by factors such as political efficacy, identification requirements, and the frequency of elections, which are more directly related to the ease and convenience of voting."
