Since she spent 1/2 hour on science and the total time spent on homework is 3 hours, we can calculate the time spent on each subject as follows:\n\nTotal time spent on homework = 3 hours\nTime spent on science = 1/2 hour\n\nTime spent on each subject = Total time spent on homework / Number of subjects\n\nGiven that she spent 1/2 hour on science, we can set up the equation:\n\n1/2 hour = 3 hours / Number of subjects\n\nTo find the number of subjects, we solve for the number of subjects:\n\nNumber of subjects = 3 hours / ( 1/2 hour\n\nNumber of subjects = 3 hours * 2\n\nNumber of subjects = 6\n\nTherefore, Keri studied 6 subjects.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 6 subjects."
