The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, \"Deal.\" The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\nB. No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\nD. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n"

The key issue here is whether the contract between the manufacturer and the supplier is enforceable under the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds generally requires that certain contracts, including those for the sale of goods over a certain value, must be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nIn this case, the contract was not in writing. The manufacturer's note, which was the only written communication between the parties, did not contain a signature. This is a critical point because the note did not meet the formal requirements of a written contract under the statute of frauds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature."
