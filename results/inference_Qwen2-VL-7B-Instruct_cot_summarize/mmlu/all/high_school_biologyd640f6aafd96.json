Relationships between DNA sequences among the species did not match relationships between skeletal patterns.\n\nThis option casts the most doubt on the relationships depicted by an evolutionary tree because it directly challenges the consistency and reliability of the evolutionary relationships inferred from both DNA sequences and skeletal patterns. If DNA sequences do not align with skeletal patterns, it suggests that there might be errors in the evolutionary tree or that the methods used to infer evolutionary relationships are not accurate."
