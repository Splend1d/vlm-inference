The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\nB. Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.\nC. Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.\nD. Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.\n"

Therefore, the retiree could have served a notice of eviction and sought a court order to evict the artist for non-payment of rent."
