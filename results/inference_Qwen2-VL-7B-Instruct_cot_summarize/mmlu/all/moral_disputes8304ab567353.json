The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism.\n- This is an objection because it suggests that the argument incorrectly assumes that genetic factors alone determine the child's characteristics and behavior.\n\nB. The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually.\n- This is not an objection. Instead, it is a statement that suggests the expectations placed on SCNT individuals would be no worse than those placed on children created sexually, which is more of a supporting argument rather than an objection.\n\nC. People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change.\n- This is an objection because it suggests that prejudicial attitudes might change over time, which could mitigate the negative impact of prejudicial attitudes on the child.\n\nD. If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.\n- This is an objection because it suggests that allowing SCNT should be contingent on prejudicial attitudes changing, which implies that the current prejudicial attitudes are a significant concern.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not an objection is:\n\nB. The expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
