In this experiment, sex is used to divide the children into two groups ( boys and girls.\n   - Blocking is typically used when there is a known variable that could affect the outcome. In this case, sex is a known variable that could influence how the toys are played with and thus the durability of the toys.\n\n4. **Design Type:**\n   - A completely randomized design would involve randomly assigning treatments to subjects without any blocking factors.\n   - In this experiment, the children are divided into two groups by sex, which means the design is not completely randomized.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**A. There are three types of paint and two sex groups, giving a total of six treatment combinations in this experiment.**\n\n**C. Sex is a blocking factor.**"
