Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population.\n\nInbreeding, or the mating of individuals within a small population, can lead to a loss of genetic variation and increase the risk of harmful recessive traits becoming more prevalent. This can weaken the population's overall health and resilience, making it more vulnerable to extinction."
