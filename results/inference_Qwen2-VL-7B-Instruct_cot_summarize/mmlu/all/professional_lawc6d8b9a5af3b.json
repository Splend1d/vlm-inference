The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:\"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. \"The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. $10,000. 00\nC. $18,000. 00\nD. $24,000. 00\n"

This is because the youth, at the time of the accident, was 18 years old, which is the age of majority in this jurisdiction. Therefore, he is legally responsible for his actions and the contract he entered into. The youth's letter to the dealership, stating that he was willing to pay $10,000 if he found a job in the next month, can be considered as an offer to settle the debt. Since the youth did not make any payments during the second year of the contract, the dealership has the right to sue him for the remaining balance of the contract, which is $18,000. However, the youth's letter can be considered as an offer to settle the debt for $10,000, which is less than the remaining balance of the contract. Therefore, the dealership's proper recovery would be $10,000."
