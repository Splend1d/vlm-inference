Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met the highest standards for medical care. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death. The witness stated that \"the expert told me the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. \"On objection to this testimony, defendant's attorney seeks a ruling on the admissibility of this question and answer. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the testimony is hearsay.\nB. overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\nC. sustain the objection, because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.\nD. overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.\n"

The defense seeks to rehabilitate the expert's credibility by introducing a prior consistent statement, which is a statement made by the witness before the alleged motive to testify in a certain way became known to the witness. This statement is intended to show that the witness's testimony is not influenced by the alleged motive.\n\nThe rule of prior consistent statements is generally recognized in many jurisdictions and allows for the admission of such statements to rehabilitate the witness's credibility. The statement in question, made by the expert immediately following the patient's death, is a prior consistent statement because it was made before the expert knew about the potential motive to testify in a certain way. Therefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection and allow the introduction of this statement."
