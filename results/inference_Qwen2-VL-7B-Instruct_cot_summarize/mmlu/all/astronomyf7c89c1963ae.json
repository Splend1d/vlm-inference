You can never prove your theory to be correct only \"yet to be proven wrong.\"\n\nIn the realm of scientific theories, it is important to understand that theories are never definitively proven correct. Instead, they are continually tested and refined based on new evidence and observations. The process of scientific inquiry is iterative and ongoing, with theories being subjected to rigorous testing and scrutiny. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it reflects the nature of scientific theories and the continuous nature of scientific inquiry."
