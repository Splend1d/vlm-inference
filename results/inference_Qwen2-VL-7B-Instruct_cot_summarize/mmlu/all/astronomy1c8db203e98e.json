They reflect enough of the sun's light to make them brighter than most background stars\n\nAsteroids are relatively small objects in space, and they do not emit their own radiation. However, they reflect sunlight, which makes them brighter than most background stars. This reflection of sunlight is what makes asteroids stand out in sky surveys searching for them."
