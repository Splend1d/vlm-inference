The kernel of a homomorphism \\( f: G \\to H \\) is the set of elements in \\( G \\) that map to the identity element in \\( H \\). \n\nFor a homomorphism to have an empty kernel, it means that every element in \\( G \\) maps to the identity in \\( H \\). This is possible if \\( G \\) is a trivial group ( i.e., a group with only one element, which is the identity element. In this case, the homomorphism \\( f \\) is the identity map, and its kernel is indeed empty.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n**Statement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.**\n\nA nontrivial homomorphism means a homomorphism that is not the identity map. For a homomorphism \\( f: G \\to H \\) to be nontrivial, there must exist at least one element in \\( G \\) that maps to an element in \\( H \\) other than the identity.\n\nConsider a finite group \\( G \\) and an infinite group \\( H \\). If \\( G \\) is finite, then there are only a finite number of elements in \\( G \\). Since \\( H \\) is infinite, there must be at least one element in \\( H \\) that is not the identity. Therefore, it is possible to define a nontrivial homomorphism \\( f \\) from \\( G \\) to \\( H \\) by mapping each element of \\( G \\) to a different non-identity element in \\( H \\).\n\nThus, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. True, False**"
