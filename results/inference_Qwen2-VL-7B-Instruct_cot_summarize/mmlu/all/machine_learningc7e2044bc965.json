The variance of of an estimator depends on the specific data and the distribution of the data. There are other estimators that can have smaller variance under certain conditions.\n\nStatement 2 is True. In AdaBoost, the coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers are always non-negative. This is a fundamental property of the AdaBoost algorithm, which ensures that the final model is a weighted sum of the individual classifiers, with non-negative weights.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
